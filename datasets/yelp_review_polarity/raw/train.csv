1,"Here's one of the best downtown restaurant to go for a breakfast ! The food is good and the service excellent. And they actually serve real maple syrup. \n\nSo if you want a good place to eat in the morning : Hurry up and arrived before 9 am ( to avoid line up !) relax and enjoy a nice breakfast !  \n\n\nC'est une des meilleur endroit \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al au centre-ville pour d\u00e9guster un excellent d\u00e9jeuner, de plus le service est tr\u00e8s bon.\n\nSi vous chercher un bon endroit ou manger le matin : d\u00e9p\u00eacher-vous, arriver avant 9 heure am ( afin d'\u00e9viter la file) et relaxer en d\u00e9gustant un excellent d\u00e9jeuner !"
0,there should be a negative rating on here.  one star is way to high.\ni am sick and tired of how the cable box is never working their solution? KEEP RESETTING THE BOX... YES IT IS MY JOB TO MAKE SURE I GET MY SERIVCE ON A DAILY BASIS.  IT'S NOT THEIRS TO MAKE SURE IT WORK.  Plus they have poor customer service but I don't blame the people that answer the phones but the people who st the rules to nickel and dime it's customers. \n\ncharter is horrible and since i coudn't get thru to complain on the phone here is my truth.  Charter is the worst.
1,"Pittsburgh isnt a city known for its culinary prowess, but there are little gems around town that I can always find myself going back to. Its not about amazing food, its not about cheap food, its about good value, and thats what Trams is. Their spring rolls might not be something to write home about, but the coconut vermicelli is great, and something you are seldom to find elsewhere, in fact, i havent ever had that anywhere else in my american dining experiences. vietnamese coffee is like intense dessert here, and a nice sugary-caffeinated pick me up thats not unwelcomed. Go to trams! get some noodles n'at!"
0,This place sucks I went there on sept 4 2014 the girls bartender are to loud and rude one of them slap my brother so hard in the face and told him not to touch her jukebox . She lucky I didnot turn around to knock her out I will not good back because of this
1,"If you know me you know I love Las Vegas! So I hardly will find a place I can't have a good time at - as long as there is vodka, good vodka.\n\nI came here while in Las Vegas for work in early 1/2010. A few of us got out after our work commitments and thought we would check out the new hot spot. It isn't an easy location to get to if your cab driver isn't up to speed on the location then you will get dropped off in the wrong spot. A few in the group had to walk to whole mall - annoying! Once at the club the door gents were polite and got the 12 of us in quickly. Coming up the stairs to get to the club which is over Beso steakhouse you could already feel the sound system! I must stay ... impressive! I could feel the beat in my body all night. The girls working the bar are all beautiful and seem to be pretty nice and they poured some nice above average strength drinks. We danced the night away watched some animated porn footage - which was pretty funny and jetted out back to our hotel pleased with the location. The only thing I would have love was if it was a bigger location. It was raining pretty heavy when we were there so maybe it would be different if there was an outside area - didn't even bother looking. \n\nOn a side note ladies: Bathroom was clean and the ladies working in there were a blast - dancing and taking care of business!"
1,"While staying at a Best Western in Tempe, ordered Rosati's for delivery. The pizza was delivered in promised time frame. It was a thin crust, and was baked to perfection - cheese covered the other toppings and was nicely browned. The salads we ordered were crisp and garden fresh with high quality dressings (Ken's), and packaged croutons.  I had failed to mention the 5$ off coupon I had while ordering by phone, but called while delivery person waited - person on phone was extremely pleasant and happy to make the price adjustment."
1,"Of course with 1000+ reviews this place is not so secret. Nor is it very hard to locate when you have a line visible from the 3rd floor escalator. Get in that line cuz it moves fast and yummy pizza is waiting for you. I've tried the pepperoni and the white pizza with garlic, mozzarella and ricotta cheese. They have beer in red solo cups. And regardless of how busy they are, the server manages to be friendly and ask how you are doing. It's a tiny space with bar stools and three arcade games. Most people take their food to go."
1,"I wish I lived closer, I know it is not NYC,  but I enjoyed the theater and the performance.  I had a fantastic time watching Ten Chimneys, it was a fun show."
0,"i would give negative star if possible - constant problems with the lane during our 5 games, staff wasnt of any help, at all. it's my first time, as well as last time."
1,"Chris is AMAZING! I shocked this guy normally handles the cooking, serving, greeting, etc. by himself.  The night we went, he had a waiter but that is because he had about 30 people in the place.  The food - two words, incredibly fresh.\n\nWe were lucky enough to sit at the bar by his kitchen and we got to watch him cook.  He has amazing organizational skills.\n\nWe started out with roasted peppers (garlic, rosemary, olive oil), arugula, proscittuo salad with toasted bread and freshly shred cheese.\n\nThere were three choices for the main course.  Chicken w/chimichurri sauce, salmon with capers, green onions in a white wine cream sauce and sliced filet mignon over chinese black rice.  The rice had green onions, italian sweet hot peppers and other spices in it.  He squeezed a fresh orange and orange zest over the steak and then surrounded it with thai chile sauce.  The combination of flavors were incredible.\n\nDessert was a napolean puff pastry with lemon cream, topped with tons of fresh blue and blackberries, fresh whipped cream, powdered sugar, etc.  \n\nUnfortunately, he was so busy that we didn't get to talk to him too much, which based on other reviews, was a highlight. \n\nWe will definitely go back.  This is a treat!\n\nWe've come back to San Diego and told all of our friends about it."
0,"For the price, I would expect much more. The food was not very good. Do yourself a favor and go to Olives at the Bellagio instead."
0,"Okay I just want to say it is a beautiful place, really it is. The Interior design here is great and it was cool to see, BUT this place was FAR to crowed, I mean it was crazy.   \n\nThe place was divided up into a bunch of small rooms with a bar, each had unique decor and different music playing which was pretty cool.  It operates on 3 levels, the main floor which is chill and has the restaurant, the second level which has the stage and other smaller rooms and upstairs where TAO beach (TAO Beach was better) is on the roof.    \n\nWe went to see Public Enemy and the downside was that the entire place is all about VIP seating and booths and if you aren't VIP you are constantly shuffled around like a farm animal AND if you paid to see a show on a tiny stage, you wont see it very easily because the only standing room is the line to the bar and back out, unless you pay for a place to sit where you can view the stage. Also as others have pointed out the people there don't really seem to care about the music they came to see either....just a brainless crowd that acts stupid. \n\nThe drinks are way overpriced and small for what you end up with.  I was in heals and not being able to sit down really pissed me off (just sayin).  It was one of those annoying stand in one of 2 million long lines to get in while everyone acts self important scenes, just to get into an over crowded and overpriced bar with no place to sit.  Overall it was an experience and I can appreciate the good points of it.  LIke seeing what we did of Public Enemy was pretty freakin cool even if the bouncers were constantly telling us we couldn't just stand there and watch the show we paid to see LOL."
1,"Great place!  Playground, train rides were inexpensive,   museums had wonderful kid activated trains, cheap snacks, building and grounds were well maintained.  Areas for Birthday parties and picnics.  Wonderful day for family."
0,"Liked the ambience. Pretty typical college town pub with enough TVs to catch a game from most tables.Plenty of room and not overly crowded on a Saturday afternoon. Good beer selection, but no listing of brews on tap and too many for our waitress to remember. She recommended a seasonal brew that sounded good, and was, but 10% ABV! Print out a beer list that at least shows alcohol content, brewery, and style of beer! Ordered a pizza. Ugh mistake, $17 for a 12 inch with doughy crust and what looked and tasted like a cut up hot dog as sausage. The happy hour burger deal was excellent however and the burgers were quite good. Just having a listing of their beers would get them another star."
1,"Enjoyed an absolutely delightful meal here with several friends.\n\nStaff were amazing, we had no reservations and they were able to accommodate 6 of us on a Saturday night. They were also extremely pleasant during service. \n\nThe food was tasty and the portions massive!\n\nBut the best part was dessert. Their ice cream selection was amazing, about 20 choices, each one more tempting than the last. They should sell that stuff by the tub to take home!\n\nWorth a visit, but book, I wouldnt imagine everyone would be as lucky as us."
1,"D'lish can be hit and miss, but when it's a hit, it is soooo good. I love their breakfast sandwhiches, and they usually have really good coffee. It gets really busy on the weekends, so prepare to wait a while if you're there on a Saturday or Sunday morning. If you ever drive by on the weekend and don't see a line, you owe it to yourself to pull off and get something to eat. \n\nI typically get their egg and cheese breakfast sandwich, and I'll add either bacon or chicken sausage. My wife loves the croissant sandwich, which has egg, cheese, tomato, bacon and pesto. We'll also typically get coffees or a blended protein drink or something. \n\nIt's a great place to come for breakfast and coffee, but at times, the wait is really long, and the food/service can suffer when it's really busy. I'll continue to go there pretty much every weekend. Highly recommend."
0,"when i first saw that a 'pizza and grill' was on its way i was very interested as ive never bothered with the prior establishments there.\n\nmy buddy and i went there rather quickly during opening week only to find out they did not have any pizza yet....\n\nafter a couple weeks we decided to try again and see what could become of this place. \n\nhappy hour is unimpressive with drink specials. $2 domestic bottles is an okay deal, but $13 for a shallow premium pitcher seemed excessive. but they do have a couple good quality brews.\n\na rather small, quiet place with a patio and 5 flatscreens. it could be a nice place to catch a Cards or Dbacks game, that is if they maybe put the sound on.\n\nbut it really came down to the pizza. getting a 12\"" with pepperoni was an ideal test. turns out it was decent. toppings seemed generous, but the crust seemed a bit generic. maybe their specialty pizzas are the key(?). pizza-wise they are a slight upgrade on Zipps (next door), but thats not really saying much cause im not a fan of zipps pizza.\n\ni was expecting much more considering the word 'pizza' is right in the pub's title. really not a good enough reason to go back as Zipps is right next door with better drink deals and atmosphere.\n\ni wish them luck."
1,"being new to the area and finally regaining my desire to eat tacos again (had just been to mexico a couple months ago and ate tacos everyday for almost a week), i decided to hit up yelp for a local taco shop. since i live down from south blvd. and have seen all the spanish all up and down the street, i figured it was best to try my neighborhood first.\n\nmy husband, 3 year-old and i hit up casa grande yesterday night--hoping for dollar taco tuesdays (according to a previous review). however, it seems management has had problems with it in the past and have since removed that from their weekly deals. no bother. their tacos are only $1.75 a piece, delicious and filling. my husband always gets tacos de lengua, and i always get tacos al pastor. we were both not disappointed, and we both ordered an extra al pastor a piece to round out the yummy in our tummies. my husband often gets jugo de tamarindo (i think that's what it's called--he speaks spanish, but i do not), and it was large and in charge! i got a coke and realized that i probably should have got the juice. it seems that they dabble in other latin american cuisine--like el salvadorean, honduran, and colombian. \n\nservice was friendly and accomodating (for a picky kid that actually does not like cheese quesadillas), food was delicious, and the price was right. the place was a bit of a hole, but that's never stopped me before when i've got a hankering for good, authentic food. we will definitely be going back!"
1,"Best coffee place ever.  Matt, the owner, remembers your name and your order, and even remembers my dog.  The amazing friendly staff does too!\n\nThey have outside seating, bike racks that often double as dog tie-ups (with a water dish near by), and one wall is a garage door, so it's perfect for warmer weather. This is extra nice because they are also always packed with people!"
1,Best bakery in town! Feels like new York
0,"Nope. They get one star for the strawberry margarita and cheese crisp.  One more star for their green salsa... YUM.  As for the rest of our meal?  I ordered flautas and my date ordered a salad.  We love spicy food, but this is just spice with no flavor. The food was just  tasteless, lacking & underwhelming. THE SERVICE WAS ATROCIOUS.  Yes, atrocious."
1,"The best mall E V E R. It's not like we don't have these stores in SF or NY but for some reason, I just love shopping here. (Well, it's aways fun to shop when you're on vacation!) And it seems there is always a good deal somewhere! This place is the reason why I always end up having to expand my luggage or check in an extra bag. This past trip, I even had to pay $25 over the weight limit fee! Boo."
1,Nummy.\n\nLOVE 5 guys. Best burgers. Fries are pretty good.
1,"Amazing! Great food, great service. We had the stone crab which was amazing! I had a filet mignon which was cooked perfectly. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't feel like a nice fine dining atmosphere. Two thumbs up. Get the stone crab!"
1,LOVE their new blow dry bar!! Very stylish and hip and loved the way they did my hair!!
0,"For all the hype, Michael's is quite a disappointment. \n\nMaybe it's because I didn't try the custard. But seriously, I didn't need more weighing down in this weather...so I ordered an orange crush float instead. For something that would have cost me MAYBE 50cents to make at home, I paid close to $5 for a 12oz cup. That is ridiculous. In general, I think their prices are pretty steep for what you get....you'd probably have to order a burger to really get a bang for your buck...\n\nLike RB, I also had an issue with the service. It was slow, disorganized, and not very friendly. The line was almost out the door, but the employees behind the counter didn't even ATTEMPT to speed up the service. One of them just disappeared into a back room. tsktsk. I also thought it was hilarious how one of the employees crumpled up an order form before the order had been completed, and then had to UNcrumple the paper so she could re-read the order to her coworker. Really? \n\nAnyway, I will probably give the Monroe St. Michael's - and their custards/burgers - a shot, but I'm not going to get my hopes up."
1,"We love Saddle Ranch during Happy Hour.  All of their drinks (minus bottles of wine) are half off..even the tall drafts!  The appetizers are also half off, we like the big sampler platter that has multiple burgers, wings, ribs, sweet potato fries and onion rings, this platter easily feeds my husband and I as our meal for only $10!  We have never dined there for the regular menu but everything coming out on the trays looks good, although a little pricey."
0,Worst service and the food comes out cold.
1,"This pizza hit the spot! Tastier (and cheaper) than most of the recommended casual pizza joints on the strip. A little on the greasy side, but nothing a napkin couldn't fix. Can't beat this value."
1,My favorite day of the month!! Lots of music n entertainment n art. The bbq stand out front of the gypsy den is amazing. The gypsy den has music in the front and in the back. There's bands on the street. More at the Arts factory and at the local studios.  They even alow dogs.
1,"This is my new favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I went there on Saturday with my boyfriend and two other friends of ours for lunch. We arrived around 12:30 and the place was already busy and had a 20-30 minute wait. We decided to sit at the bar and grab a drink while we waited for our table. I couldn't believe their pitchers of beer were only $5 and they had my favorite, Hoegaarden. \n\nWhen our table was ready the server came over promptly and grabbed us two more pitchers of beer. We started out with the bruschetta however we let the server choose what bruschetta we would be eating that day. If you know me then you know that I'm a snobby/picky eater but I was blown away with the Roasted Peppers and Goat Cheese bruschetta. I would have never tried goat cheese but I'm glad that I did. It was so creamy and flavorful. Also on the plate were: Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Albacore Tuna with Gaeta Olives, Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. We gulped down the last of our pitcher, ordered around round and had another round of their delicious bruschetta. This time the server brought us: Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese (I'm begging you to try this one), Salami with Pesto and Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios. They were all so mouth watering that I highly recommend all of them. \n\nAt the end of our lunch the server brought over a complimentary desert for us, a salted caramel sundae: vanilla bean ice cream with chocolate covered corn nut's, a pretzel stick and salted caramel. By far the best dessert I've ever had in my life. \n\nPostino's left such an impression on my boyfriend and I that we ordered takeout the next evening. We both decided on the Turkey Panini with a side of salad and the organic chips. They make their own lemon honey dijon salad dressing which tastes great on everything. \n\nI will definitely be a repeat customer at Postino's and I am demanding you to try it out this week/weekend. I promise you will not be disappointed."
0,I'd rather have Chipotle.
0,"Maybe it's the whole Hotel de la Montagne that i don't like...but Thursdays is one place I try and pass on for me.  Anytime someone I know suggests it for a 5 a 7, which surprisingly is often, I try and get out of it, unless I really have to go.\n\nThe main floor is tolerable (briefly) for drinks and for the price of the 2 for 1's, but the dance 'club' is disgusting.  The clientele is just horrible, like 60 year olds that should not be wearing what they are wearing.  The dredges of society seem to gravitate towards this place.  The fact that you also have to pay to 'experience' this is even more bizarre.  There is also a revolving dance floor, don't know why that is a cool thing to have...?\n\nOne saving grace on the main floor is that there is a guy serving hot dogs in baguettes, all dressed if you want, for just tips during 5 a 7.  They taste good too."
1,"I had come to this restaurant the other day thinking it was Kabuki Dining Bar going through a renovation.  I had asked the waitress when they started renovating and she told me that this was no longer Kabuki, it was now Sakana.  I was sad at first when I heard Kabuki was gone, but I was willing to give Sakana a chance.\n\nSince Sakana was still going through the process of renovating, I noticed a few differences in some of the art hung up and a new flat TV playing K-Pop and American music videos.\n\nAs for the food, my husband and I were throughly impressed.  We decided to get the AYCE sushi for the dinner price of $22.95 (lunch is $20.95).  The waitress asked us if we wanted to add the All You Can Drink for an extra $3 (!).  We had to opt out, but its ok, next time!  Anyways we mainly ate nigiri, like Yellowtail, Salmon, Super White Tuna, etc.  They were all succulent and quite fresh!  I liked how there were sauces for some of the nigiri because they each complimented their fish.\n\nWe tried to order Uni (Sea Urchin), but a sushi chef (head chef maybe?) came up to us in person to apologize that he couldn't get it shipped in this week because his supplier had told him the Uni weren't fresh due to weather conditions.  We were totally ok with that and both thought it was thoughtful of him to come over and tell us that.  \n\nSo to all you sushi lovers out there, come over to Sakana... Their food is definitely worth trying!"
0,"***I have been to a few House of Blues locations and this was probably the weakest of the bunch; pretty run-of-the-mill food***\n\nPlease note that this review is for the food only.  I've been to three House Of Blues--the original one in Chicago (which had a very nice interior, and the food tasted better too; maybe the atmosphere helped), the one in Anaheim (super busy, okay food), and this one at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas.  I felt this Las Vegas location was the weakest of the three.\n\nIt was around five-ish, and we had late dinner plans.  We decided to come here to hold us over.  It was pretty dead.  For food, I went with the Buffalo chicken sandwich, which was pretty run-of-the-mill.  It was served with pretty boring and depressing looking french fries.  It was your typical chain experience."
0,"So even after all of the bad reviews, my husband and I decided we would take our 13 month old today because she loves aquariums. We thought we would give it a chance.  So I went online to try to purchase tickets and on the main website, Concord wasn't even an option. So then I went on the website directly for the Concord one and after entering half of our credit card information I couldn't even purchase tickets because something was wrong with the website.  Disappointing already and we haven't even left the house. :/"
0,"this is one of those places you eat at cuz you're walking around and suddenly hunger creeps in... and walking anywhere else is really too far.  \n\nthe cheerleader-esque waitresses usually hover over their podium outside gossiping... and once in awhile one of them will look up and seat you.  \n\nand if you want to order water... its bottled only (for like $1 i believe... which is cheap for bottled water here... but expensive cuz you just wanted friggen FREE water right?)  \n\ndont order soup (fuck you diet)... it's definitely from a progresso can... you get like half a can of soup for like $5-6.  \n\ntiny and dry chicken wings...\n\nphilly cheese steak sandwich is good... except for the bread, which is COLD?!\n\n$10 all you can drink during happy hour... that's pretty sweet though."
1,"Excellent lunch today.  Our first visit to Bravo ever and will be back.  The rattelle with sausage was very good and the Pasta Bravo was tasty.  Sweet tea was sweet and light,  not to heavy.  We will definitely be back to see our waiter Ben."
1,"very helpful staff, amazing products and I love their builds ! highly recommend checking out this vape shop"
0,"I visited this location a couple of weekends ago. I was alone and just wanted to have lunch before I went to see a movie. I was seated in a section that was pretty much empty. I was placed in a corner and no server over to my table for 10 minutes. I even went so far as to make eye contact with a server and wave at her and she just looked away. I got up and went to the hostess station and told them that I wasn't going to wait ten minutes for someone to acknowledge me and that I would be taking my business elsewhere. I am a former server, bartender and host and I feel like this is unacceptable for the staff to flat out ignore someone."
0,Service sucks sooooooo bad. I waited 25 minutes for a bowl of chili? Really? Did they have to hunt a cow? I mean you scoop it in a bowl and you serve it. It should only take 5 minutes but 25 minutes???? I walked out.
1,"I travel through Fort Mill on occassion and noticed this little place.  I stopped in to check it out and the folks behind the counter were very nice.  I let them know this was my first visit and they explained the $5.95 lunch special to me.  It consists of a pit sandwich with your choice of meat (beef, pork, turkey, etc) or a hotdog, a side, and a drink.  The photo I took is of the lunch special with a pit beef sandwich and fries.  \n\nI have the say the sandwhich was great!  It comes piled high with thinly sliced pit beef, fresh onion, horseradish, and mayo on a large bun.  Absolutely delicious!  The fresh fries arent to shabby either (cooked fresh while you wait).  \n\nI have been here twice to eat so far and there has always been two people working behind the counter.  Maybe they were just short handed when the other reviewer was there?!?!\n\nTry the pit beef sandwich and you will be glad you did!  Make sure you get it with the horseradish as it's the only way to go and it's the traditional way to eat a pit beef sandwich.  I havent tried the pork or turkey yet but really don't plan too since the beef is sooo good!\n\nIt's a local busines and I'm glad to support them!\n\nPS - They have new hours which are 11-6 Mon-Fri, not sure about the weekend hours."
0,"WARNING: DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!\n\nVery dirty!! I saw them wash the facial towels with used pedicure towels, a cockroach, and there was an ant trail!! \n\nThey were so rude! They didn't know I speak Vietnamese and they were talking shit about the customers and how cheap some of the customers were. They were also saying how picky they were too!\n\nVery nasty and unprofessional!!!"
1,"Buffet attendant brought out fresh prime rib for me, and it was the most juicy, tender, and generous cut I've had in Vegas yet.  The $15 price was covered by the cut, mashed potatoes, and broccoli alone."
0,"Terrible--to be honest if the mixed smells don't scare you away the obvious addition of food coloring into everything breaded should.\n\nI've eaten here three times and every time I've been violently sick, off two chicken dishes and one pork.\n\nAny hole in the wall Chinese restaurant is better then this!"
0,"While we were seated immediately, the food service took just shy of an hour. The appetizers were served promptly though, but there was no reason dinner should have taken nearly an hour. All we ordered was two salads and some lentils. We had to leave even before it was served because we had prior plans, and were nearly late. The reason our meal was late was that the kitchen forgot our order and the waitress didn't check on why it took 45 minutes to make two salads. The waitress apologized, but the manager don't even bother to talk with us.  I'm certain we will not go back. The appetizers we had weren't that great either."
1,The buffet is awesome! There was a wide variety of food for brunch! The place is pretty big and clean. The staff were nice. However I don't know how I feel about serving your own drinks.
0,"I have never left a sushi bar so angry and exasperated in my life!\nKoi has more rules than a elementary school cafeteria at lunchtime!\n\nThey don't let you go outside for ANYTHING once food is on your table... not until you pay the check. \nThey tack on a 15-18% gratuity even if the service is sub-par, and normally at places where gratuity is automatically tacked on to the bill it is. \n\nI was included in a party of 15 for my friend's birthday party and part of the desire to give our patronage to Koi was the All-U-Can-Eat Sushi (which a portion of this party has indulged in on a previous visit). \n\nWhen we were seated the waitress told us that a portion of our party couldn't order the All-U-Can-Eat Sushi, it had to be all 15 of us or none of us. \n\nWe were contemplating just getting up and leaving, and we should have. I had a feeling this wasn't going to end well and it didn't. \n\nThe birthday girl decided to stay and we ordered. Then we were informed that they wouldn't accept certain coupons from the Arrowhead Koi... this is like a disenfranchised franchise. The owner seemed to be creating his own rules. It didn't even say Arrowhead on the coupon... it just looked like one they didn't take... according to the waitress. \n\nThe service was slow... very slow and we waited to get drink refills. Then the waitress came back to tell the birthday girl that someone took her order... so she had to wait for it to be remade. \n\nAll the sushi rolls looked the same. There was no artistic value to the food. I couldn't tell the spicy tuna tempura apart from the tempura calamari roll, and the taste reflected sameness. Quite disappointing since sushi is an art form when done correctly (or just done better).\n\nThe waitress left dishes and empty glasses on our table for the entirety of the meal, and when she did finally clear things away she dropped dirty soy sauce chop sticks right on the birthday girls lap. Yes there was an apology on the part of the waitress, but it shouldn't have happened.\n\nAccording to the friends that have come to Koi before they raised their prices... and they don't take American Express and they don't have a Happy Hour - the large beers were $6 - at Yen I could get the same for $3. \n\nWe ALL decided that we are not going to Koi ever again, tonight they just lost 15 customers. \n\nPretty pathetic."
1,Great go-to place for lunch.  The menu items are done well - mostly sandwiches and salads.  Owner is very friendly and takes an active role in the business. It seems like he runs the place well.
0,"Maybe some locations just have bad kharma and are not meant to succeed....like a cold spot in a  haunted house,  this place just kind of makes me uncomfortable. Bad feng shui perhaps - or maybe it was the nasty food, drinks and slow service. I am really not sure. \n\nWhen I heard the beautiful story of the chef,  taking his crew from a franchise  to his own  start-up restaurant, every dot-com bone in my  body wanted  to enjoy  this place! \n\nThe service was slow and inattentive - even  though the place was pretty empty.  Camille H did a great job of describing  our food - I,  however, would put up a good umbrella stick fight about ordering the polenta with cold shredded chicken ever again. I still have to fight the gagging reflex every time I  think of that soupy substance they tried to pass off as hummus. The ceviche was good, but the crackers  were not.\n\nI won't go back."
0,Not my ideal hotel by far. But it was cheap and you definitely do get what you pay for. I don't like kids so I wasn't happy about that either. The room decor is perfect for this place. Tacky as hell! But it was a place to lay my head and it wasn't dirty.\n\nOne plus though was the margarita stand that opened at 10am. Gotta have my breakfast margaritas!!
1,"I got there at 815am on a Saturday.  The man that greeted me and took my wash order was extremely helpful and detailed with his explanations of the services.  They vacuumed and I left my car at the wash while I went next door to eat breakfast at Burger King.  Previous Yelp reviews said that the detailed cleanings are about 40 minutes from the start until finish.  I believe the service was a hand wash and wax and I paid for an additional engine cleaning since the compartment was so dirty.  When I returned after 30 minutes they were indeed working hard getting the interior and windows spotless.  I will never complain on waiting if my car is continuing to get additional attention and cleaning. After 10 minutes the employee called me at the completion of my car.  Unlike other \""detailed washes\""  World Class employees showed me the car first before parking it.  This is outstanding service as they wanted to make sure nothing was missed.  Nothing was missed, it was a great cleaning in every way.  They did an amazing job!  Like other Yelpers, this place gives you a detailed cleaning comparable in my opinion to the higher priced mobile services and at half or more of the cost and you don't have to wait, just drive up and they start cleaning.  World Class is twice as thorough as any of the full service car washes in the area at the same price (almost all of the others are much higher in price).  I will never go to any other place other than World Class from now on.  It is that good.  This place is a hidden gem.  I will be bringing my SUV next weekend.  Thank you to all of the staff as this was my first time there.  Thank you for being was so complete and thorough with my pride and joy, 2010 Camaro."
0,"I was very disappointed after my first visit to the Graze and I doubt I will be back. Some friends of ours were in town from Milwaukee and we meeted them at the Graze for brunch. After being seated we noticed we had dirty water glasses and requested new ones. Our waiter appeared as though he had just rolled out of bed and seemed like he was high or something...so the service we received was not good and his unprofessional appearance was not very appetizing. We then proceeded to wait almost an hour and a half to receive our food. Some of the tables surrounding us received some beignets on the house to apologize for the long wait, however, we were not one of them. Instead our waiter offered few apologies and kept bringing us more coffee in more dirty cups. We ordered the cheese platter to share amongst the four of us and our waiter never brought us plates so we akwardly tried to eat it right off of the platter. Not to mention the portion was minute. I got the lox on a bagel and it was downright disappointing. The bagel was neither toasted nor fresh, it was stale. And the amount of lax wasn't even enough to cover one half of the bagel. Again for the price you pay at the Graze so not worth it. It is a shame because this place has a great location and appears to be a nice restaurant, however, dirty dishes, minute portions, the long wait and unprofessional waiters do not make me want to go back or recommend this place to others."
0,Our cheap rental is turning out to be $450 more because of the dent on the hood they insist was our responsibility. \n\nBIG TIP: Make a representative walk around the car with you and sign off on the no dents before you take the car off the lot or you could be the next one duped. \n\nI have never given a company a bad rating and I should have looked  here before renting at Fox since not many people had anything good to say.
1,"so.. i've read many reviews that made my mouth water about this place and have been wanting me some fattoush for a while! so randomly driving by about 2 weeks ago with my dusty  i realized omg \""fattoush!\"" pointing out the window, looked at him and said \""i need it!\""\n\nthe thought of being in falafel heaven, made me happy.. it had been a while since i had good falafel, it didnt let me down. i had the veg plate that came with lentil soup, hummus, a pickle!, dolmas, eggplant mmm so good and of course falafel! they gave us plenty of pita bread which i was thankful for since most the places i have been to give you 1 or 2 thin pieces! and charge you for extras. ugh! i love my bread. thank  you.\n\nwe sat near the window next to their cute decorated christmas tree and annoying flies :/ , and watched the rain. other than the flies it was grreat."
0,"I gave this place a couple of chances, because the Chinese restaurant which used to be in this location was quite good and I felt some nostalgia in coming here  (I know:  makes no sense; but then again, I rarely do).\n\nThis is a SAD excuse for a Thai restaurant.  Here are some of my \""issues\"":\n\n1.  Dry chicken and pork dishes;\n\n2.  Inattentive or incorrect service from both the \""family\"" staff and part-time students, who come and go about as often as you change your underwear (I hope);\n\n3. Staff spends more time taking phone-in orders and dealing with walk-in take out orders than they do with customers eating here.  Though they DO take the time out\nto sing old, unliked songs from the 70s and 80s up on their karaoke stage with the volume turned up extra high to distract you from the crappy food;\n\n4.  Cleanliness at the tables is subpar;\n\n5.  More than once, the bill has been \""inadvertently\"" miscalculated (and one time, had things on it they never brought to the table).\n\nIt doesn't help to complain as management makes clear in half-hearted apologies and mumbling, that it's your fault, white Devil, for not appreciating Asian culture and unreasonably expecting good service.\n\nSpare your taste buds, your wallet and your ears (especially) and go to the other good Thai places in the West Valley.  Buddha will thank you for it"
1,Food was amazing! Anything with the wide noodles is awesome and the mango Martini was great!
1,"This only gets 4 stars because I love the food.\n\nWent there to get a bowl to-go for lunch today.  There was an extremely long line that wrapped around back toward the cashier.  The line moved fairly quickly, so I didn't mind.  In front of me was a tall, bigger guy who ordered a bowl with chicken.  Then I ordered my bowl with chicken.  Here's the part I don't get--I understand that you're super busy & all, but how come the big guy, who looks like he could eat less, get a bigger scoop of chicken than me, this little Asian girl who looks like she could use some more food?  Shouldn't the restaurant serve equal portions?  Where's the consistency?  And efficiency!  Just think--if a customer orders double meat, but the server scoops two big scoops that amounts to like three regular scoops or more, that is one less customer they can serve.\n\nAnd then they skimp on the guacamole scoops.  If I'm going to pay an extra $1.80 for just a scoop of guacamole, I deserve a full scoop!"
1,"Prices are very reasonable, the staff are very nice, and kids can get their toes polished with a design for only $5! \n\nThey also play really good movies! Haha ... You never know what will be on when you pop in :)"
0,OK food. But HORRIBLE service :( the waitress messed up the order and then lied about how long the food would take.
0,It was alright.  I know it's not bellagio buffet but I expected better customer service.  The food was average.  You get what you pay for.  But the service.. well.. not that great.  We had to keep hunting our waiter down to get drinks and refills.  Don't think I'll come back any time soon.
1,"Really good carnitas burrito!! \n\nThis beaner gives it 5 stars for taste, service. And authenticity.  Will defiantly come back."
0,"Paris hotel was so so. Room was average decor but appeared run down and dated. Stain on ottoman, missing knob from entertainment center, scratched up baseboards, and door to room was all scuffed making it appear dirty. However room size was larger than normal and the bathroom was nice with a walk in shower. \n\nPrevious reviews indicated rude staff. Those reviews were right on. Check in started nice however when I asked to upgrade to a Petite Suite with view she rudely said nobody gets a petite suite with a view over a weekend. She made me feel embarrassed for asking.  \n\nDay of leave we went to have our bags stored. Bell hop was dealing with a customer before us. His demeanor with those customer was rude. They were looking for their bags and needless to say he told them to go back to their rooms to find them.  They had a hard time with English and he wasn't about to slow down and try to help explain things.  When it was our turn he wanted to know why we were storing them and then went into interrogation mode wanting to know rudely what we were going to do while our bags where there.  His way of asking really put us on the defensive. We seemed to be an inconvenience for him and he didn't attempt to hide it.  \n\nOverall disappointing experience for a hotel that appears so nice on the outside."
1,"This is my kind of local diner eats. I'm from NJ and grew up with places like this. Breakfast is perfect. Eggs, some kid of meat, hash brown potatoes, toast, and about a gallon of coffee. This is what diner like Badger Cafe do and it is great normal American breakfast stuff. They do nice lunches with a daily special for lunch and dinner. I'm an open roast beef plate fan and sure enjoy their burgers. Badger Cafe is famous in the area for big burgers served the way YOU want them. This little \""Local\"" Cafe is attached to but not part of the Rum Runner. Glass walls and doors separate the two. It may not be much to look at but, don't let looks fool you. I think the Wait Staff people are Quick, Friendly, Know their menu, and talkative. The folks who come in are mostly familiar faces. They are the   \""Locals\"". The Badger Cafe is: good prices, good food, quick service, and friendly people. You can't ask for anything better than that."
0,So my first visit to this place was back in 2011. I have gone back a couple times over the years in which I recently went a month ago but what I have noticed is that the service has gotten really bad. I went with a friend to get dessert and when I asked for the molten lava cake the waitress said they didn't have any in stock. So I ordered the banana creampie which I didn't like very much. The service wwwterribly slow and the staff wasn't that comforting. Looks like Dominicks Steakhouse will be the place to go next time!
1,"First note the Costco food court only accepts cash. With that said it takes very little cash to have a great meal. I stop in here frequently for a quick lunch or dinner. The hot dog and a soda combo is only $1.62 with tax. That includes a Hebrew National all beef jumbo hot dog and a fountain drink with free refills. There are also free toppings for your hot dog including onions sour kraut and the usual ketchup and mustard. If you are feeling more adventurous there are polish sausages available as well.\n\nIf a hot dog is not your fancy there is pizza by the slice or by the pie. If you wish to have a veggie pizza you must buy an entire pie. This pizza is decent with a sturdy crust and generous amounts of toppings. The slices are quite large and once can would be a sufficient meal. \n\nfor desert there are many great options, there is a incredible hand dipped ice cram bar covered in a thick shell of chocolate with optional free nuts. Frozen yogurt can be had in chocolate or vanilla or with berries for just a bit more. There is the famous churro, no longer must you go to Disneyland or Mexico for this Latino delight. There are also mocha and berry smoothies that challenge the offerings of the best coffee shops. \n\nDining is pick nick style, first come first serve at the tables. There is an additional seating annex with great window views of Tempe."
0,"Strictly comparing the food at other Filipino restaurants I give this place a 2.5. No \""blood\"" stew included in the buffet while the other Glorias locations do. Overall food quality/authenticity is OK at best."
0,"I really wanted to like this place. And it was not good at all. \n\nWe stopped in on a Thursday night around 8:30. Salt of the Earth was too crowded, so we walked up the street to Verde. Since we anted to go here for a while but kept forgetting about it, we thought it kinda worked out that we could go there instead. \n\nThe place was about 30% full. Most people were sitting outside and I think my 30% is pretty generous. We sat inside. Our waiter was very nice and welcoming. He read the specials. (there seemed to be more specials than food on the menu.) Also the descriptions of the food were so detailed that I really would have preferred if I could have read them myself. \n\nWe ordered two tequila flights. For $6 each, it seemed like a bargain. Nothing was explained about what we would receive. He seemed to have read off brand names of tequila, but they could have been the names of mixed drinks. Regardless, a $6 tequila flight seemed like a good deal. \n\nFor food we ordered the seviche special and the pork tacos ( also a special.) Someone promptly brought us water and chips and salsa. \n\nThe chips and salsa were the first things to come out. Things were clearly not going to be good.... The salsa was green, like a tomatillo base? Maybe, but it was sweet... Didn't taste like much else. \n\nWe waited a bit longer for our drinks and food. \n\nAnd a bit longer. \n\nThe we got a fresh order of fish tacos with black beans and rice on the side. They looked great. I was hungry and I ate some of the beans and picked some veggies off the tacos. \n\nThen I remembered that we didn't order fish tacos. Fish gets fishy when fried or overcooked. The fish smell was a little too much. We eventually found our waiter and told him that we thought we had ordered the spicy pork tacos. He was like, \""the pork tacos aren't spicy,\"" and I was all \""ummm.... Ok, but we didn't order fish tacos regardless.\"" \n\nHe took the tacos away. \n\nWe waited some more. And ate sweet weird salsa. \n\nThen the ceviche came. The fish, which type I can't  recall now, was thick and fleshy and white. it should have been cut into smaller pieces. It was lemony and Limey. It needed salt and some other flavoring. It also didn't taste like fresh lemon or lime, but rather the bottled kind. \n\nThe our tequila came. Either they were tiny mixed drinks with tequila or different kinds of tequila. One had tomato juice in it. They came with a paper label, but it didn't help. It told you about favors you might taste. Some tasted like straight warm tequila, while others tasted like mixed drinks. They were ok, but I still don't know what they are. I never saw the waiter again to ask. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later our pork tacos came. They were not good, the tortilla was good, as we're the pickled veggies on it. But the pork was big fat dry pieces that had been boiled. They were not tender. They should have been shredded with a lime squeezed on them. Big hard chunks of pork are not easy to eat in a soft taco shell. (The tacos came as a pair. They were large and served with a side of rice and beans. Also they were cheap... Like $10)\n\nUgh. Nothing was expensive (about $10 for entrees), but nothing was good enough to come back. Maybe the tequila?"
1,"It started off with a groupon; a very nice deal, if I can say so myself. \nThis place was inside the Chandler Fashion Mall on the side of Dillards. On one side, there was a hair salon and behind the counter was a door that lead to a waiting room for massages and facial. \n\nWhen I first went, I had a groupon for both facial and massage. It was a nice deal for about $54 or so for both. The facial was great, I had it with Tara. The massage was not bad either. \n\nAfter the facial, Tara showed me some products (of course). I bought some products (oil-free moisturizer and a cleanser) and I tried them. It worked quite well and Tara said a little goes a long way and it does. \n\nSince I liked the Facial so much (minus the extraction), I scheduled an appointment again with Tara. She sold me the extra $18 of, I believe, some sort of a peel but it tingles your face with the activation of steam. The total bill was about $90 something with tip about $100 something. I guess the price isn't too bad but I think I am going to stick with either groupon or home facials."
0,"First I'll have to say I don't like spicy food so asked what I could order that was not spicy.  Server was very helpful with my questions.  I had the endive salad and was not impressed - it was okay but would have been a lot better if the nuts in it were candied, it needed more contrast in the flavors.  Corn bread was good.  For dinner, had the special which was chicken coq a vin, greens with bacon, and potatoes.  Didn't really care for it.  The chicken was a leg and thigh, cooked well, but wasn't what I've thought of as coq a vin, kind of tasted like it was cooked in wine and soy sauce and the flavor pretty much stayed in the skin of the chicken which was okay because I didn't think the flavor was that great, but left me with eating plain tasting chicken meat.  Only ate about 1/4 of it.  The potatoes were ok, nothing special.  The greens left me with a yucky taste in my mouth, maybe too much smoky flavor.  My dining companion had the vegetable Wellington and I tried it, actually thought it was really good, wish I had ordered that, although it was a bit rich it had a lot of flavor.  Service was okay, attentive until the check was paid at which time we were totally abandoned though we did stay a bit to chat (the restaurant was not busy) - that's not too unusual though.  After hearing so much hype, left feeling disappointed.  Maybe you have to be really into Cajun food to appreciate this place."
0,"I came here because of the reviews off of Yelp, but the hype for this place is excessive.  \nFirst, this place is overpriced.  I don't mind paying extra for something that is worth the price, but the Pho here is mediocre.  I should not have to add a large amount of \""Cock\"" sauce just to flavor the dish.  \n\nSecond they have a small selection of Pho dishes and the wait staff is slow as hell.  This could have been resolved by having additional wait staff on the clock, but I guess the management was trying to save money.  \n\nLastly,  the portions are small in comparison to most Pho restaurants.  I had finished my meal in about five bites.  \n\nI am guessing the ownership is probably  business oriented and not food oriented.  \""Make everything seem special, and the rest will fall in place.\""  That kind of idea does not work in a restaurant setting.  \n\nThe only reason I am giving this place two stars is because the restaurant looked nice, but I know now if I want good Pho at a good price the restaurant should not look like an art gallery.  I am also guessing most who have wrote reviews for this place gave it such a high rating because of what the restaurant looked like.\n\nThere is definitely better Pho restaurant choices in Mesa/Tempe/Chandler."
0,"Me and my gf just got done eating here.  Everything on the menu sounded great and we decided on the chicken Benny and she decided on the sirloin sandwich daily special.  My plate had plenty of food on it, but when I took the first bite it was unfortunately fairly cool, not warm at all. As I got to the center if the plate it did get a little warmer but it just wasn't as hot as I like.  My gfs sandwich was very big but she told me it was very bland tasting.  I tried it and she was right it didn't have a delicious taste.  I't wasn't bad but for a 15 dollar sandwich and fries I think it could have been better.  We have been wanting to eat here because we had coupons, but guess what they said that they couldn't accept the coupon because it was a holiday.  Halloween,  I guess I should have known better considering on the back it says not redeemable on holidays.  Come on who ever thought that halloween would fit into that category.  Well I was wrong!  So 32.00 dollars later I did have leftovers but that's about it.  I don't know if we will be back, maybe one more try later.  Oh forgot to mention that the server only came to us about 2 times and never offered to refill our drinks.  Also she didn't offer a straw for our drinks.  Now that I think about it the only reason why I'll be back is to use the coupon once and for all and to try the snickers pancakes!  Happy halloween."
1,"I'm from Chicago originally, but I go to school in Madison and decided to finally find a salon in Madison that I could go to regularly. After looking reading many reviews on Yelp, I decided to give KODE a try, as their prices are not that steep and the reviews on Yelp were pretty good. I love that they do online booking, it is extremely convenient.\n\nI scheduled myself for a half head foil with Kelly Z. Now, I have naturally black hair, so coloring it always presents a challenge, but Kelly Z was definitely up for the challenge! Even though I didn't know what exactly I wanted, she was able to give me something that I really like. We ended up deciding on putting 3 colors in my hair, black, light brown, and blonde. The results were amazing! This is probably the best highlight job I've ever received. I also have very thick hair, which Kelly Z was able to handle. I felt a little bad because she ended up spending about 3.5 hours on my hair, but it was well worth it.\n\nI will definitely be going back to Kelly Z at KODE when I'm due to touch up my highlights."
0,"Stay away from The Children's Place! There's an old bitchy lady that works there that's rude as all out!! I went there today to use a gift card that was given to my 5yr.old on his birthday to get him some p.j.'s.\nBefore I even walked through the front entrance, this wicked witch of the store comes rushing up to me and says,\""What're you looking for!!??\"" Not even a hello or good morning!  I told her that I was looking to get my son some p.j.'s, and with that she said \""OH... CARRY ON!\"" I was like, WTF!?  So I just blew her off and went on with my business thinking she was just having a \""senior \"" moment. But come check out, she said forcefully that needed my email address and phone number  to complete the transaction. I told her I just wanted to pay and wasn't interested in whatever promo they were offering. She then said with a huff, \""FINE!\"", and mumbled something under breath. \nI then asked her if there was a problem, and all I got for an answer was a serious glare with attitude! \nAll I can say is if this is the way this company trains its employees, I'm NOT shopping there again!"
0,"This place was terrible!\nTerrible service, old equipment, dirty uniforms and slow, slow service!!\nWe order a basic cheese hotdog, and they just reheat something that was already sitting on the grill, which makes me wonder if they're even following health regulations on temperatures and food handling.\nWill never go back. Was just too gross."
1,"I think that I have eaten at all the Michoacan locations through out the valley and the original Lindo Michoacan on Desert Inn is by far the best. It is worth the drive. One of best Mexican restaurants in the city. I love their chips, beans, and salsa that they bring when you first sit down. It never fails that I finish every bit. The fresh guacamole that they make at the table is a must!! The taquitos are so fresh (they make their own home made tortillas). My husband got the whole fried talapia, and devoured every bit. Their super burrito is the biggest burrito I have ever seen, it is also delicious! We have been several times and never been disappointed."
0,Took a long time to get our drinks..manager did not accommodate our request o. Our game..  And the pace not packed.  And when she did..  She put it on a small TV..  Too dark and just didn't get a good vibe of place.  Failed to live up to hype that TV promotes.
1,"While I am all for having healthy and affordable lunch options Downtown I am not a pita person and thusly my attitude towards the Pita Pit is I could really take it our leave it. Why would a person who doesn't like Pitas go to a Pita pit, that remains a good question??? \n\nThe ingredients are very fresh. In my mind they are burrowing the Subway assembly line idea but instead of bread they use pitas. I enjoy fresh veggies and fast service but would enjoy them more so at another restaurant where the pita doesn't come with. \n\nI am giving four stars because they're doing what they're advertising which is putting things in a Pita and doing it with efficiency  too."
1,GREAT for Gluten-Free dining. They have amazing gluten-free bread and very knowledgeable staff. Highly recommend the French Onion Soup!
1,i come here for their yummy grilled cheese!
0,If I could give NO stars I would! This place is so unorganized. I reserved a car to pick up and when I get there they tell me they don't have any cars and ask me to come back. Well obviously I don't have a vehicle since I'm coming to a rental car place. Super unorganized and incompetent staff makes this a VERY irritating situation. I highly recommend to everyone to rent else where!!!!!!
0,Tried to go but business is now closed.
1,"Comme Ca has the best value meal I've found in Vegas. $22 for a 3 course meal? I don't think it gets better than this! I got the french onion soup, the mussels, and the creme brulee. The french onion soup is fantastic. The soup itself is rich with sauteed onion and bread that has soaked in all the flavor of the broth. And the best part of course, is the gruyere cheese on top, especially the crusty parts. I'm really not doing it enough justice by describing it. \n\nThe mussels are good (but not as good as the soup, ha). I love that they present it in the cast iron pot. Comme Ca's mussels come with whole roasted garlic and sausage. I love the garlic (it's been cooked long enough to be super sweet) but not the sausage so much. It gives it a meaty and heavy taste, and I'd prefer it to be lighter. (My favorite mussels, BTW, is Bouchon or ACote in Berkeley). All in all though, it's still a decent main course.\n\nI'm usually not a fan of desserts, but I love creme brulee and Comme Ca makes a solid one. You can see the bits of vanilla bean in every bite of custard, and the hard caramel is caramelized perfectly. I also had a bite of the pot de creme (orange was the flavor of the day) and it's a light, clean, and refreshing dessert.\n\nAll in all, it is really a bang for your buck kind of meal. I've also tried a couple things on the regular meal, and I really liked the oxtail benedict (oxtail is very tender and it's a solid eggs benedict) and the duck and pork belly \""cinnamon\"" roll (sweet and savory dish that is very interesting). The only dish I haven't been a fan of is the beef tongue hash (not all that spectacular). Service was great (it was a very slow Saturday lunch for them), and another plus is that it has a great view of the Strip if you want to take some photos."
0,"Bachelor Party Weekend!\n\nSo we dropped the big $$ and got a 2 bedroom suite! The suite itself was freaking amazing. Definitely 5 star worthy. It had a tub, huge projector screen, super modern feeling and really nice.\n\nThen why the 1 star? The service here absolutely sucked. For example:\n\n1. Asked the cleaning staff to clean the room. Came back, and.... they made one bed. No new towels.\n\n2. Called for some towels. Was put on wait for 15 minutes...\n\n3. Called concierge to ask a question. Put on wait for 15 minutes, transferred to the wrong people. Transfered again to the wrong people. Gave up.\n\n4. Called asking if we could get some toiletries. Was told no. Person hung up.\n\n5. We wanted to book a Cabana. Apparently that's impossible unless you physically go out to the pool, hunt down one of the Cabana workers. Great...\n\nJust in general, the place looks amazing until you want some help from the staff. Then you might as well bend over and kiss your rear.\n\nNow normally that's not a 1 star, but the thing is this is Vegas. Going to any 4 star + hotels you will never have this crappy of service."
0,"This place get negative stars! I had to pick one star but it doesn't even earn one. Awful! We arrived on a Sunday evening, there were 2 other tables seated. There was a gentleman who worked there standing by the bar and another employee standing there and neither greeted us. We stood there for a minute before I asked if we should sear ourselves. The answer was yes. \nWe ordered a large salad for 3 to split with dressing on the side. Then we ordered 2 gluten free pizzas and asked if the 'classic lasagna' had cheese because it doesn't say on the menu. The waitress said there was. \n45 minutes later we get a small salad with dressing on. Waitress apologized and offered to bring another but it took so long we declined. \n30 minutes later our pizza came. One burnt the other was fine. A few minutes later the lasagna came without cheese. We never got refills and no one checked on us.  After awhile another waitress asked how our meal was and we spoke up and said, not great. She offered to get the owner. Well, watch out if you have a problem! We planned on just letting him know what happened and we were disappointed. He came to the table with his arms folded  (turns out he was the gentleman that was at the bar and didn't greet us either) asked what was wrong. We told him about the lasagna, the salad and before getting any farther he got defensive telling us his lasagna doesn't have cheese and if the waitress told us that, we shouldn't tip her. What kind boss tells you not to tip his employees???\nWe told him that's not what we wanted. He started getting defensive telling us it sounds like we do this all the time and HE never told us there wasn't cheese its our problem and kept telling us we don't have to tip the waitress and he's been open for 13 years of business and clearly he's been successful and it's us that was the problem.  I have never in my life experienced that treatment in a restaurant. I will never return here and I will tell people NOT to go here. I have no idea how they are business."
0,"My friend and I were in the mood for some Indian cuisine. 4 stars on Yelp is pretty good, right? Unfortunately, the best thing that can be said about this place is it has a nice interior, more upscale than your typical Indian establishment. Otherwise, the food was decidedly mediocre and the service was absolutely atrocious, some of the worst I've experienced in a long time. But let's start from the beginning...\n\nOn a big banner right outside the restaurant, they advertised a 3-course dinner for two for $29.99. Upon inquiring about this option, our waiter informed us that special was no longer being offered and they've been meaning to take it down. However, they did have a 5-course tasting menu, served family-style, for $45 per person! Now either the waiter was bullshitting us or their website which advertises the same special is out-of-date as well. Either way, this is what you call a classic \""bait and switch\"" and FALSE advertising! We should have taken the hint and walked out then, but we were hungry. Unfortunately this same thought would be a recurring theme throughout the rest of the evening. So we asked what was included in the 5-course tasting menu and were not terribly excited by what we heard and it didn't seem worth anywhere near $90 for the two of us. We asked for a \""few more minutes\"" to peruse the menu.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes, we decided to get the sweet apricot and raisin naan ($4), chicken tikka makhani ($13), seven spice veal ($25), baby eggplant ($11), and 2 side dishes of chana massala and aloo gobi ($7 each). Oh and we had to pay another $3 for a single order rice because none of the entrees came with any! We ended up waiting another 15 minutes before another waiter spotted us looking a bit perturbed and asked if we needed anything. We told him we were ready to order. I thought he was going to take our order but instead he just told our original waiter that we were ready and would be \""right with us\"". Our waiter was running a couple's credit card with one of those portable terminals right at their table. After the receipt was signed, the waiter continued to idly chat with them for another 5 minutes or so. Then our waiter disappeared into the kitchen or God knows where for another 10 minutes before finally coming to take our order. He apologized for us waiting \""a few minutes\"" (yeah right, try half an hour). I would be more understanding if they were really busy, but less than 1/5 of the tables were occupied. I know, I know, we should've walked out already.\n\nSo finally our order is in, but we wait and wait and we wait some more. We continue to watch other customers who sat down after us and ordered after us, get their food first and in one case, actually pay the bill and leave! At this point I am so incredibly green with envy of the customers who have the \""other waiter\"". After about half an hour, they finally bring out all the food at once. At this point, we were absolutely ravenous, but our spirits lifted in the hopes that it would be worth the wait.\n\nUnfortunately, while the food satiated our hunger pangs, it was substandard Indian fare. The naan was not crispy at all but rather thick and gummy. It didn't contain very much apricot or raisin and no chutney, tamarind, mint, or any kind of condiments were offered. The chicken makhani, usually one of my favorites, was kind of bland. It lacked the spicy complexity that a good curry should have. The chicken didn't seem to be marinated at all. It was dry and was probably cooked separately and then tossed into the curry at the end. The aloo gobi was mostly potato and contained very little cauliflower. We both got bitefuls of undercooked, semi-raw potato as well. The chana massala, veal, and baby eggplant dishes fared no better.\n\nDuring this time, no one stopped by to ask how the food was. Nobody offered to refill our nearly empty glasses of water until we were ready to pay the check. After asking for the check, we waited over 15 minutes before our waiter returned and was expecting to collect the check. When we explained that we still had not received the check, he disappeared for another 4-5 minutes before finally returning with our check. We usually pay via credit card, but decided that we better settle up in cash lest we want to spend another half an hour waiting. I almost never leave no tip, but I'm thinking this is one of the rare situations that qualify. However, my friend lobbies hard to leave at least 10%. As we're walking back to our cars, a Black crack whore tries to solicit us. Ah, a fitting end to such a memorable evening!\n\nHere's the executive summary: nice interior ambiance, over-priced mediocre food, horrendous service. I am sorely tempted to give this 1-star but since the food was at least edible (except for the undercooked potatoes) I suppose it just BARELY merits 2 stars. Take my advice: save your money AND time. Don't do it. Just go somewhere else, like Mount Everest, Namaste, or Samosa Factory."
1,"WOW!  What an awesome concept!  World of Beer is a fantastic place for us beer snobs.  Located right on South Blvd and Bland street.  There is street parking or there are spots if you turn onto Bland off South, in the parking garage behind WOB.\n\nThe interior is inviting with a very long bar, high-tops and low tops.  TONS of tvs to watch the game.  There is also a small patio with comfy seating outside too.\n\nThere are two menus - one of drafts and one of bottles.  The menus are organized by beer type!  Genius!  \n\nWe stopped by here yesterday and grabbed a table outside.  Folks had their doggies runnin around - it was so relaxing and chill!\n\nI had a great half and half ($6 bucks) - perfectly poured.  If you get hungry there is food available for delivery - see the spiral menu in the back.\n\nThe one complaint was that one of my friend's drinks was not charged properly when she got the bill.  Once she pointed it out to the waitress however, it was taken care of right away.\n\nWe will definitely be back!!!  :-D"
0,"Having visited The Barrymore twice previously for lunch, I was looking forward to giving it a shot for dinner. Unfortunately, bad service and below average food ensure I won't be returning for a fourth time. \n\nOur group received slow service every step of the way. Despite the restaurant being 3/4 empty, we had a long wait to be seated, receive menus, have our orders taken, receive our food and get the check. We had to ask for a drink menu and bread. We had long stretches when our server was nowhere in sight. \n\nI ordered the filet cooked medium. It was raw. Others in our group also received their food undercooked. \n\nI liked The Barrymore as a hidden gem away from the bustle of the Strip, but after this experience I won't return and will quit recommending it to others.\n\n\nUpdate: Management from The Barrymore contacted me as a result of this review in an effort to get more information and to make things right. I declined the offer for a comped meal, but the genuine concern from management is a good sign that they're trying to do the right thing."
1,one of the best hotels ever. i stay there at least once a year for a week and its always great. they just refurbished their pool area and its magnificent.
1,I have had this place in the past. Never disappointed. Sweet chili wings are very good. The customer service was also great.
0,"Stayed here a couple weeks back and what a lovely atmosphere, however disappointment.  The service from planning to leaving was either very great or very poor, one extreme to another, no middle ground, here are a few examples, when we checked in early we were told the room would be ready in an hour, after that hour they said another hour, then turns out it was ready until 6pm! Wth, we then missed our afternoon plans... got to our room, wow what a great room until you look a little closer, very poorly cleaned. If you lifted a glass there was a ring of dust, all of the snacks had dust. My neighbor opened her drawer and found condom packages. Our bathroom was half stocked, we had to call for toilet paper and they never brought it. Asked for towels, never came. Now the Bed however seemed very clean (good they focused on that) very comfortable. The elevators designed poorly each time we used it took about 20 min or so because every time it came it was FULL. OMG and the pool, wth, I never thought that prior to booking I should ask what the prices are, turns out they have very little free/first come seating, it is all reserved, meaning you have to pay a min. $600 in food and beverage to reserve a simple lounge chair, not even  a cabana, rarely anyone could afford this which means more than half was empty and nowhere to hangout.  I would visit here, maybe a cocktail (all the bars were awesome) but I would not stay there again after this experience, not worth it."
0,"Wow. This was bad. LOL. The only save for the night is my friends' good attitude to make the most out of the situation. Maybe because it was a Wednesday night? We decided to go since one of our guys was wearing sneakers and a t-shirt and we were guaranteed in. [why is wearing sneakers such a big deal anyways? Easier to dance in them... if you're really dancing.]\n\nMusic - Really slow. They played popular top 40s music and that was all good, but it was so slow. How do you dance to Fun's \""We are young?\""... even if it was a remix. There was a mix of decent songs, then momentum would stop with a bad song. The most action on the floor was when \""Gangnam Style\"" played. \n\nCrowd - Empty. There were maybe only 5 people dancing on the small floor when our group came in. It grew a little as it became later, but most of the crowd was sitting in their tables watching everyone who would dance. Maybe people would dance if they drank more... leading to...\n\nDrinks - Cover was $20 with drinks included. Should have realized that meant little to no alcohol in my Vodka-Pineapple. I drank 3 of them within half an hour and... nope. Nothing. Again - maybe people would dance more if they had a bit more alcohol in their system.\n\nAmbiance and setting - It was okay. More like a lounge. I think if there were more people it would look better. It's relatively small and nothing stood out.\n\nI would not go again."
1,"I love how many great restaurants in the Phoenix area are in strip malls. It always makes me giggle.  Atmosphere is nice - it's contemporary and has good energy.\n\nWe shared the calamari appetizer, it was great.  Nothing highly unusual, just good calamari.\n\nI had the chicken sausage pasta dish.  It was yummy, but not as good as the scotch beef my parents ordered.  GIven the chef won \""Iron Chef America\"" (only challenger that season to beat an Iron Chef) - I expected the food to be a bit more adventurous. It's pretty straightforward - almost comfort food.\n\nOur service was great - the server had been there a long time. She was friendly and attentive."
1,"Stopped in for a quick drink! We got beers, cocktails and the garlic monkey bread. For 4.95 I didn't expect much but we would come back here for the monkey bread alone! Great service and cool ambiance. I loved the local art that was featured. I'll be coming back here again soon!"
1,"We just returned home after 4 days in Vegas. 2 nites in a row we were at Level 107. We loved it. There were 7 of us. Great service, the food(appetizers) we very good and the martinis great. 2 for 1 on martinis, 50% off appetizers. I'm usually not a martini drinker, but the caramel and the raspberry were very good. Go there, you'll have great drinks, service and a nice group of friendly people working there."
1,"Had dinner last night here from a recommendation from Chowhound. All in all a solid Chinese restaurant in Chinatown Montreal. We ordered the Lobster Ginger for $25. I thought this was extremely tasty, although hard to eat (lobster generally is). The lobster seemed large though and generous portion! We really enjoyed the Mongolian beef. Cooked well, great thick sauce and a nice addition of vegetables. For appetizer we had dumplings in peanut sauce which were good."
1,"Dankashane Darling Dankashane! \n\nGreat location and good food, Gordon Biersch is a decent spot to grab a micro brew and an appetizer with friends. The GB (Gordon Biersch) beers they have on tap have never disappointed me, but never really blown me away either. They have many other cocktails, but when you order a sweet cocktail at a place like this, expect little liquor and lots of sugar. For some that is just fine, but when I order a cocktail, I want to taste the spirits with every sip. \n\nThe decor is nice here. There are many vintage prints on the wall with names like Campari, Bugatti, and some German products being featured. The bar has a few TVs, but this is not a sports bar. There are copper colored accents around the restaurant which ornament the wood trim. \n\nThe food - Good stuff in general. The appetizer platter is a nice way to start the meal if you're with a group. I especially love the Asian wings, which have a sticky glaze, crisp breading, and sweet-chili flavor. The garlic fries are GAAAAARRRLIICTASTIC! They are delicious, but stay away from them if you plan on doing some kissing or close talking after dinner. Really nobody should be close talking anyways, its gross and people don't like it. \n\n\nI like this spot for a casual and relaxed bite, especially when I'm not trying to eat healthy. Yes you can eat healthy here but honestly, that isn't why you came, so just go for it. The gym will be waiting for you when you get up from your nap."
1,"This salon has a great feel when you walk in.  I love its brick walls and the chalk board door used to state the menu and prices.  The people working in the salon are all warm, kind and hip.  There is a tattoo studio in a back room, a nail gal with amazing hair and 7 chairs for hair. \nMy stylist was Kelly Kay who is amazing!  She brought my dyed black hair back to light blonde.  Her cuts are always amazing and my hair is fine and not easy to cut.  She's precise and has an quite the artistic eye!  She has also cut my teen's hair and my 10 year old.  She makes my daughter with thick wavy hair look amazing!  \nIf you're looking for color she is the best!  I've had problems in the past with other stylist and breakage.  Kelly Kay is so careful to not overlap and damage the hair.\nA must check out if you are looking for a new stylist!  KELLY KAY!"
0,"Husband and I came here for our anniversary, we had the groupon for 2 meals and a bottle of Rose... The menu seemed rather small and there wasn't many choices to pick from. I had the steak frites and husband had the chicken. The fries were delicious, but the steak was bland. It had no flavor, was pink in the middle even though I specifically said I wanted it well, and our waiter was really attentive and kept checking up on us... which was nice, but annoying at the same time. Can I at least attempt to enjoy my crappy steak without being interrupted every few minutes? My husband ate half of his chicken and said it was gross, so he was done... I tried it out, sure enough, it was too moist... almost as if it wasn't cooked all the way. Rose was an interesting wine, but from now on, I just need to stick to my moscato. Maybe I'm just too picky, who knows. I just wasn't impressed. the prices were just too high and the food just wasn't worth it. I honestly would never in a million years pay full price for what we ate, it just wasn't that great. Definitely wish we would have just went to outbacks steakhouse.\n\nHowever, the view was amazing. The atmosphere and decorations were really nice, and the staff were friendly.\n\nFor those of you with groupons that want to come here... If you want to order a meal that's more than the $32 allowed, they only take off $16 from that meal, instead of $32... makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The pork cost $34... you would think that if I had ordered that, I'd only have to pay $2 more, right? wrong! that pork would have costed $18. This whole thing makes no sense to me."
1,"The wings here are excellent.  The \""suicide\"" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good."
0,"Take your money to Texas De Brazil...the food, ambiance, and service is ten-folds better there. We only dined here because we had a coupon for 'buy one get one free'.  Having had used the coupon, we still felt a little ripped off for what we paid. The food was bland and overly salty.  The selection at the salad bar was not really a selection at all. We paid extra to get seafood along with our dinners, but the only thing we sort-of liked was the skewered shrimps. Don't spring for the unlimited seafood and churrascaria,..the seafood is not worth the extra money at all.  Our waiter was non-attentive, we actually had to flag him down to get our check and have him take our payment.  \nI would've been upset if we did not have our 'buy one get one free' coupon. Take your money to Todai next door....although I have not tried this Todai...I still think it would be a better bet than Pampas. It was not worth the money at all."
0,"If it were for the view and hype alone- 5 stars.  However, for the c-note per person average expense: the food and service left much to be desired.\n\nI am quick to judge an upscale restaurant on a simple rule: do they offer you a dark or light napkin depending upon your attire?  I was wearing a black dress.  Everything is white at MIX.  No offer of a black napkin.  Okay- that is my little hang up, but usually it is not a deal breaker.\n\nWe were seated in a lovely corner seat, but before we had ordered our wine, the hostess seated another party directly next to us (the tables were tight in and had to be moved to seat anyone in or out - so when I say 'next to', I mean literally 'on top of').  If it were a busy night, that would have been fine, but there were only a handful of tables occupied.  In fact, we were so close that when the palate cleanser came out - the waitress made a joke and served both our table and our unexpected dinner partners' together as if we were in the same party.\n\nThe servers were nice- but my plate was taken before I was done with my meal and water spots on our flatware were pointed out to us (seriously) and explained why they weren't dirty, it was just a chemical-reaction-but-here-is-a-new-spoon-anyway-even-though-you-didn't-ask.  Who knew there was flatware TMI?\n\nThe food was decent.  Our highlight was a phenomenal bottle of wine (very extensive wine list) and the ravioli appetizer - out of this world.  Our entrees?  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.\n\nWe went to MIX for a romantic Vegas evening.  It was definitely Vegas- but Vegas in the 'pot-bellied-balding-Elvis-impersonator' sort of way.  I wouldn't complain if it were my only Elvis sighting- but you know it doesn't live up to what is around every other corner.\n\nBut- the view was spectacular."
0,Even if the food is made by Iron Chef i would never come back here. Only 2 tables and it took them 1 hour to serve the food.\nWaste of money. And after all the wait the food was not made correctly. I can make a better burger at home.\nDon't waste your time going.
1,"What a little gem this restaurant is, located in Paris! This is always at the top of our list of places to eat whenever we go to Vegas.  If we don't stay at Paris, this is probably THE only reason we step foot into that hotel. Food is so wonderful, I usually get the Rib-Eye & it is always seasoned and cooked so perfectly!  Price is as good as it gets for the quality of food that you are getting.  Highly recommend this place for a nice and delicious steak dinner!"
1,Had a great time here. Beer selection was nice and the food was memorable.
1,"Sexy Frenchies dancing on a small stage in an intimate French theme theater. I'm glad to have watched this show before it was taken off, everything about this show from the ticket booth, to the entrance and theater design was just a fun experience. They seat you very close to other guests and would take pictures like they would in any other show. The show is about admiring the female body and is very tantalizing almost like strip tease and not to mention topless! \n\nOoh La La"
0,Worst service ever!!!!!! Their waitress seriously need more training or just more manners!!
1,"What an amazing show!  I love the Beatles and have been wanting to see this show since I heard about it.  Luckily, a friend was coming in town so I had an excuse to do the touristy thing and see it.  The visual effects were insane.  I wish I still did drugs cause this show would be a trip!  The skating part was pretty rad and the surround sound on the seats was killer.  My friend was in a wheelchair and they were able to move a chair out and give her her own little surround sound speakers.  Pretty neato.  I'd like to see this show again.  There was so much going on that I'm sure it'd be like seeing a whole other show the 2nd time."
0,"They had 3 hostess up front doing nothing and didn't even greet us. Booked reservation for 17 and she tried to cram us on 3 tables. We had no space to move elbows. Why would you even try to seat us like that? Reason I book reservation is to have enough seats ahead of time. \n\nWhen I walk up front ask host if I can get a bigger table. She gave me an attitude. And was like \""sure\"". Never got a apology for cramming us into a small table. The place is a family style with big dishes. The way they had us seated we wouldn't been able too move to grab our food. Terrible customer service and it was my birthday. Disappointment. Will never return to the restaurant."
0,"I always enjoy my visits to pittsburgh. I was especially excited to visit after finding out there was a great place for breakfast that was on the travel network (man vs. food). I am a true food lover and Food Network and Travel Channel must really love pittsburgh. They are always on man vs food and diners, drive ins and dives. \nI found out the hard way that just because you are showcased on a dandy show doesn't mean your food is up to par. \nJust to make it very clear I am a southerner. I did however go to delucas with my girlfriend who was born and raised in pittsburgh and surrounding suburbs. So I was able to look past the brash attitude of the person at the register yelling at my girlfriend instead of seating us. She however was pretty turned off by it. \nThere wasn't a wait. We got seated pretty quickly after my girlfriend had to let the lady know we were there well before the ambush of people that poured in after we arrived. (that's when my girlfriend got yelled at) \nAfter being seated I was really excited about the food. The place was hoppin and the coffee was really good. The menu had a huge list of things to choose from. I thought it was going to be a great place. I had really high hopes.\nThe server we had was ok. Not very friendly but efficient. She was the shorter of the two I saw. We kind of wished we had the tall girl. She seemed a lot more friendly. \nWe didn't wait too long to get our food but when we got it you would have thought it would have taken a couple hours. I got the biscuits and gravy (one of my favorite breakfast foods) and potatoes. They were both stone cold. The gravy on the biscuits was more like a soup and the potatoes were well cold. I really couldn't get passed the fact that my food was cold. \nMy girlfriend got the california omelette with potatos and fruit with the Italian toast. She like the fruit and toast but that was it. I almost choked on my sausage gravy when I saw her omelette. It was practically black. I know sometimes people over cook eggs. It's not cool but it happens. How do you even send eggs out that are practically black. I guess at least it was hot. Her potatoes needless to say were also cold.\nI was really looking forward to eating at a delicious breakfast place in pittsburgh. I was disappointed."
0,"Wish I could give this one star. I wasn't expecting much other than a sandwich/sub...unfortunately it was the most boring, limp and flavorless sub I think I've ever had. I'll definitely avoid Blimpies going forward in my travels."
1,The wait was less than stated. The ambiance fun and the food adequate and abundant. Huge portions to share and fair prices plus fun staff. Yummy
0,"This review is just for the food since we did not drink when we were there.  As a place to drink beer, this is probably a decent spot, but we were joining friends later for drinks so we only drank water with our meal.  The haus brat was nothing to write home about----it was surprisingly average at best.  When I grill a sausage at home it has much more flavor than what I got here.  And for the life of me I could not taste the \""Haus Bacon\"" supposedly in the German Potato Salad.  It was pleasant outside for conversation until the live accordion player began----it wasn't his accordion that made it difficult to talk over, it was the loud amplified bass that he played with so he had to amplify too.  Did it ever occur to anyone that an unamplified solo accordion would be a nice background to conversation rather than a thumping bass which forces everyone to talk louder?  They have a customized ping pong table that look pretty cool.  If we ever come back it will be just to have a pint or two.  I'm not sure what is so \""artisanal\"" about dry brats."
0,Not sure what all the excitement is about here ... just a bunch of M&M branded junk.  Walked in and walked right back out.  LOL.
1,Oh Shady Grove you have improved! Or maybe it's the fact that I'm getting old and hit you up for the early bird special (compared to late night service). Either way the pizza is amazing (try the new shrimp option) and service was on point.
1,"Great burgers\nGood Fries\nFriendly staff and atmosphere. Next to 24 hours fitness.. \nMy post work out meal. Yeah, I now...its counter productive."
0,"We stayed at the quad this year so we would be more in the middle of the strip. It was so dirty. Carpets were all stained and the curtains looked like there was vomit on them. The room had 1 lamp which was so dim, I could barely see. I called to get another lamp, it took 3 days to get one. Everything was dirty, I ended up cleaning the whole place myself. If you turned on the water in between hot and cold, it would come out of the shower and the faucet for the bathtub. It definitely needs a makeover. Don't stay in room 226. I would rather stay at the Excalibur like I always have, at least the rooms are clean."
1,"Autentique taverne pr\u00e8s du M\u00e9tro Jarry. Buck \u00e0 2$, grosse 5,75$ et petite 3,50$. ATTENTION quand il y a des spectacles les prix des consommations augmente de 1$.

0,"Sometimes things are old and charming, and sometimes they are just old.\n\nThe rooms have all the charm and amenities of a holiday Inn. The pool wasnt useable. They did apologize for that and tried to discount a future stay. But it is so uninteresting I cant see us staying there again."
1,"Went for a quick  and light lunch before we headed over to Lake Mead.\n\nAtmosphere/location: rustic, casual, cozy; located in a big outdoor mall/shopping area\n\nFood:\n-Insalata Grande: we loved this salad, my Bf and shared it, they split it for you so it was convenient; the dressing was perfect, loved the olives and everything else\n-Settebello pizza: we shared this one too; the portion was just right for two of us since we wanted not-so-heavy lunch; the crust was okay, not too thick or thin, but a bit soggy and chewy; toppings were delicious!\n\nService: friendly, appropriate\n\nWe would definitely go back when we're in LV again."
0,"This shop is cute and while there are several dressing rooms you should definitely make an appointment because it's small and there were only 2 associates working the best I could tell.  The stylist that helped me with the dresses was helpful and sweet but when I asked them to write down a style number on a dress so I could get the opinion of my maid of honor and bridesmaid who were unable to come with me they were coy.  They told me that since it is a discontinued dress there was no way possible that I'd EVER find a picture of it online because the manufacturer pulls the pictures when they discontinue a model.  I let them know I understood that but that in the vast world wide web that I was certain there would be a picture of it SOMEWHERE even though it is no longer for sale by the manufacturer.  They continued to assure me that the manufacturer had ensured that every single solitary picture of this dress ever taken would NOT be anywhere on the web.  I knew I was taking my chances walking away from the beautiful dress but I don't care how great it was nothing was making me give them my money after telling me something so outlandish of that nature.\n\nI felt that they must have been so concerned that I would find the dress somewhere else for a lower price that they didn't want to give me the information about the dress lest I choose to buy it from someone other than them.  As a result I left there and went to Brilliant Bridal where I walked in with no appointment, found a perfect dress for only  $525 ($300 less than the one at Kiara's) that is gorgeous and has TONS of detail.\n\nI will say though that one wonderful thing about this shop is that you can haggle the prices.  When I told them what my budget was and asked if there was more they could do for me on that price since it was outside my budget once I did alterations they were willing to contact the owner and get a better deal by throwing in some alterations.  They have great dresses so if you can get a good deal it might be worth the lack of information they are willing to provide."
0,"$10 cover = not worth it. Came here with 4 ladies and they were all ready to leave after 30 mins.. \n\nWe thought we were going to a cool downtown bar to drink but this place is a club? Kinda? Anyway, none of us were feeling the music or the crowd.\n\nI'm giving this place a 2, since it wants to be a club I'll compare to the other local clubs (like revolver) which are average at best, bar smith comes in below these."
1,"Cheese and chocolate + things to dip in them? Sign me up! \n\nA longtime fondue fan, this place was PERFECT for my recent bachelorette night. It worked for the meat-eaters, the vegetarians, the bird-like eaters, and the food-shovellers. Yummy food, a fun environment and a really great set of waitresses! I love it here!"
0,"I stopped going to this location. There is always someone waiting outside to ask for money, cigarettes, a cell phone call, etc. this store is on my way to work, I used to stop here at least twice a week, then I got tired of the vagrants, beggars, and drug addicts harassing me."
0,"If I could give negative stars, I would.  I rarely order delivery pizza, and even less from Dominoes.  The last time I ordered from there my pizza was delivered over an hour late and was cold.  That was nearly 6mos ago.  Today I pre-ordered for a specific time.  It came on time but as a cash delivery.  I had ordered with a credit card online.  The delivery man called the store manager and she said it was entered as cash.  Meanwhile, I brought my laptop to the door to show it was entered as credit card, but after hearing the manager speaking about me (he had the speaker phone on) I just shoved the food back to him and said \""forget it, you guys just can't get this right.\""  Perhaps I was rude, but if they want customers they need to up their game.  Had to call my bank to make sure no charges went/go through seeing as how I entered all my info on their website."
1,"came here for lunch. when i entered the rest. i was greeted. the place was pretty large and  busy from about 1-2 pm. i ask for a to go menu. after looking through the menu they have a very large selection from japanese, thai, hawaiian, and chinese food. umm i didnt know how to think about that. i decided to go with the meat jun. which is a thin slice of steak battered with egg. its like an omelet ish. with its sauce. it came with rice and salad for about $7-$8 bucks. Price were not that bad. all about under $10. the food was really good. the staff was also nice too. would def be back !"
1,"I have to say this is a very effective and efficient car-buying approach.  I am not happy with the trade-in values...of our two vehicles appraised *Car A was a laugh-in-the-face price for a very nice 04 truck and *Car B was about $1500 less than what I had figured, but we traded this SUV in on a new truck.  No haggle means just that, they have, but likely with not deal ANY room to maneuver with price (wholesale/auction flat out price).  It has two sides one for those who can laugh and walk away and one for those to take a real look at the need or want of a new car/truck/suv that Carmax has priced nicely on their lot and take the deal.  After getting past the trade-in part that stung a little, we had a terrific experience.  We walked out on the lot, drove the truck we had researched and wanted, and drove it home about 2 hrs later...time wise was due to having little ones with us, and having one of two, very nice, albeit not-the-normal-type-salesmen in training...no biggie, we were prepared to spend at least some time anyway.  All in all this experience was really a good one.  I am not positive that I would go back when we buy our next car...as we have kept the \""laugh-in-the-face-of-the-trade-in-value\"" vehicle and will likely do better at a different dealer or personal sale...but one never knows.  I do highly recommend to buy from Carmax Tolleson, AZ.  Remember if you plan to buy, and have a trade, be prepared either way.  GOOD LUCK"
1,"Went to dinner last night with my dad and boyfriend and the food was great.  Seated instantly with no reservation, but it was pretty full for a Tuesday night.  You are greeted by your waiter and given complimentary bottled water.  They also provide a yummy bread basket, must try the pretzel bread!  The food was wonderful the prices were great, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because it was so smokey.  I am not talking cigar or cigarette smoke, it's smokey because the chef cooks in the middle of the restaurant.  Now don't get me wrong it looks really cool, but after the meal and the next morning I was coughing felt like I had smoked a cigar or something.  So if smoke doesn't bother you then you'll love this place.  It is wonderful just be prepared.  \n\n8oz filet was $38 \n12oz filet was $48\n\n*all entrees come with choice of black bean soup (which is delicious) or salad\n*garlic mashed potatoes (so good), baked potato, or rice pilaf\n*chef's veggies\n\n**We did not get an appetizer and we were full... still couldn't finish everything on our plates!!!!\n\n*****Great food, great price, amazing portions!"
0,"I dunno what bean-counter took over this place, but seriously, dude, stop counting the beans.  And steak.  And pork.  The last three times I've been, I've had to remind the preparer that a quarter ounce of meat does not a taco make.  You know who is down the block?  Salsaritas.  At the moment they own your ass.   And my dollar"
1,"For the price, The Signature is definitely one of the better non-casino hotels off the strip.\n\nWhen making a reservation, try to book a room in Tower 1. It's closer to the strip, has the gym, the lounge, and the Starbucks.\n\nCheck in was fast, and our luggage was sent up to the room immediately.\n\nIn room dining was affordable, the food came in nice portions and tasted great.\n\nFor the price I give everything 4.5/5 stars. We really loved the fully stocked kitchenette and large whirlpool tub. After a quick trip to the grocery store (though the bellman told us we could have groceries delivered to the hotel and room and service would send them up to our room) I was able to make steak and eggs, hash, grilled cheese sandwiches, and anything else we needed during out trip, which helped save on eating out.\n\nAfter a long night of clubbing in high heels, the whirlpool tub was the perfect cure to our aching feet. The tub looked clean when we first got there, but we had room service clean it while we were gone for good measure. While we were gone they also did our dishes, folded all our clothes left out, and left us extra towels and pillows.  \n\nWe drove anywhere we needed to be, so valet wasn't as ideal as a parking lot would have been in terms of timing since we were in a rush the first morning (you cant call for your car to be ready before you're downstairs). However, the bellman helping us check out helped speed things up a bit by taking our ticket down with out luggage while we got ready to check out.\n\nI'd say this place is perfect for those who aren't planning to walk up and down the strip or gamble too much. If you want to spend more time downtown and don't plan on driving, you'll be better of booking a room downtown."
1,Service was perfect! And the food was more better. I shall return for more Pho and spring rolls. So delicious.\n\n-Above was my first review. This is my second. I love this very friendly and homey place. The food is delicious. I will return again again when I have a taste for Pho. Yum!
0,"Holy cow has this place gone down hill.  \n\nDingy cracked chipped plates, dirty cups dried with a dirty towel, food debris on the edges of the floor,  dirt caked on the edges of tables, tape holding the seat pads together,  ripped seat pads.  . . \n\nIt has been abandoned into disrepair I don't even want to know what the kitchen looks like .\n\nThe food was decent but I was eating with a little apprehension wondering if I was going to get sick.  \n( I did not)  \n\n$20 bucks plus tax all you can eat at lunch is not bad.\n\nService a little slow but polite.  \n\nManagement needs to clean this place up!  \n\nEat at your own risk, I do not recommend it until the place shows some respect for the culinary arts."
1,"My pups have seen both vets, and they are absolutely fantastic with my fur-kids! Their bedside manners, and that of the staff, make it so much easier to get the pups to actually go to the vet! My Duke has been diagnosed with IMHA. Thanks to Dr. Marsh's quick thinking, Duke may have a chance at remission and living a long life. And thanks to the helpful guidance and explanations, I can help Duke live that life! They are an amazing group, and I recommend them highly!"
1,"Good food, clean environment, friendly and fast service."
0,"My Dog had been boarded here before several times over the last 12 months with no problems. I even recommended them to others and brought them business. We bought a package of 10 nights of boarding as it saved us money to buy them in advance.This December 2012 we dropped our cavalier off on the way to the hospital to have our first baby. We then received a call a few days later from the manager saying our dog caught KENNEL COUGH from another dog and was transported to a Veterinarian's office where we would need to pick him up from. The manager also said we needed to pay her back for what she had to pay the vet and that we also owed  them $70 for boarding. This place is not very organized and they don't ever have you sign papers or even check you in on the computer. I am not sure how they are able to keep track of things. When we picked our dog up from the vet's office that they had taken him to he was covered in dried up dog poop, his butt was bleeding, and he was coughing with a runny nose. It made me feel horrible to see my dog like this-he was miserable. I trusted these people with my dog and was very disappointed and angry when I picked him up and he was sick and covered in feces. I had just had a baby and did not need this added stress and neither did my dog! To make it worse when we went to pay Gilbert dogs the $70 that the manager had told us we owed was now $100. You don't tell people they owe one thing and then change it-that's unprofessional! Very disappointed and angry with what happened to my dog. Will never be back!"
0,"I want to say this is the best club ever,  but omg, this club is so overrated!!!\n\nI was really excited to finally experience the XS hype, only to find out that the club does not live up to its hype.  Waiting in line already made me not like this place.  Our friends were a few parties ahead of us and yea it sucks that people cut to meet up with their friends, but whatever it happens and you do it, I do it and yep, that's what we were doing.  And then, a bouncer stopped us saying \""you have to wait like everyone else.\""  okay, fine, we have to wait.  AND THEN, this bitch ass bouncer lets people cut for the party in front of us.....??????  thanks...for that?  later on that night i found out that one of my friends was not let in because the bouncer didn't believe her id was her.  it wasn't a fake id and the reason why they wouldnt let her in was because she said the wrong weight as written on the id.  ARE YOU SERIOUS?? its freaking vegas, she's with a bunch of girls and who really says their correct weight on their id??  and what bouncer really looks at the id anyways.  ugh i hated the bouncers there, thought they were so tough cuz they were working for the it spot in vegas.\n\nthe music sucked!!!!!!  for being one of the most popular clubs in vegas, i thought they would have played more hip hop, less house/trance.  it was like weird remixes if they did play hip hop, so no thanks!\n\nokay ill give credit to how big this place is.  it was nice that it had a spacious outdoors and how they had gambling tables within the club.  i liked how it had a lot of seating area as well.  everyone kept on saying, it was the nicest pace, but honestly i think its only the nicest because its one of the newest clubs....give it like another year...."
1,"During the holidays I purchased pies from JBs.  First of all the Manager was very helpful and personable.  Secondly the pies were out of this world.  I am not a pumpkin pie eater, but their pumpkin pie was delicious.  Their apple pie was like I have never tasted and I have tasted a few including homemade.  You've gotta' try the apple pie it will spoil you to any other pie,"
1,What a cool little place with great prices.  Free popcorn and water
0,"As my office is not far from here, I frequent this resturant for their lunch specials. Usually the service is excellent. Yesterday, I had an experience with a waitress who only had two tables, was slow with service, rude and not that intersted in her job.\n\nI had to wait so long for the check that I finally just plopped down 20 bucks on the table and left, leaving her a much bigger tip that I wanted to but I had to get back to work.\n\nWhen I informed the host of the terrible service he just kind of shrugged at me and said \"" sorry about that\""\n\nCome on people it was 11:30 am on a Tuesday only two occupied tables in the whole joint. Had to wait almost 20 minutes for my lunch and it was lukewarm.\n\nNeedless to say, wont be going back."
0,"I'm sorry, what? This place was the worst! First of all, it's a major dive in a thoroughly sketchy area (shares parking lot with really gross strip club and there's another one across the street.) The food is horrible! Horrible! Thick, bland, raw flour tasting breading with not a speck of seasoning to be found. $4.35 for a bowl of bad canned clam chowder. Fries were soggy and bland. Clams were bland as well, I've had frozen that were better. Cocktail sauce was even bland. Seriously, if you like eating at convalescent homes this is your place. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
0,"We got food poisoning after eating at here. My wife and I were on vacation from LA and couldn't go anywhere because of this!!! Food poisoning!!!  When we called, they blamed that we did not cook the meat thoroughly. We are Koreans from LA, it's not the first time we had Korean BBQ. I am very upset that they were busy blaming us that we got sick. I am contacting health department for inspection. I strongly urge you to consider other Korean all you can eat BBQ Restaurant."
0,"over-priced and gross. \""medium rare\"" ribeye steak came out looking like the burned & dried out sole of a shoe.\n\nthey get some bonus points for honesty. when i ordered a margarita, the waitress advised against it. \""they're not good. our sour mix is really bad\"" wow. \n\nstay away from this place. there are so many better options elsewhere.\n\nalso, the salad bar was more of a slop bar. all the \""salad\"" choices were drowning in sloppy oil. and guess what? THERE WAS NO LETTUCE AVAILABLE. what the f?"
0,My wife and I  came here for a quick lunch and were disappointed. The breakfast burrito was bland and the mushroom burger was made with canned mushrooms.\nThe service was extremely slow and we had to wait 20 minutes for our check
1,Bread and Butter rocks! The waffles are better than Bouchon. Chef Chris is awesome!
0,"I have been a loyal customer for three years. I called today for delivery. After an hour I called to check up on the order. The owner was frazzled and condescending.  I said, \""Please don't condescend me. I have I right to call and check up. I get that your slammed. I have a business too. \""\n\nHer response was incredibly odd. \""No, this is my business. I will cancel the order and never order from here again. Then she hung-up.\""\n\nI have my own business that has survived and thrived in Vegas for 27 years.We do 250+ events a year and 6000 daily deliveries. I am speaking from experience.\n\n When a small Mom and Pop operation is blessed enough to experience a rush;\n\n1.  It is the RESPONSIBILITY of the owners to properly staff themselves.\n\n2. Maintain prompt and courtesy service to their customers.\n\n3. Remember how they got there (and this is ia SMALL operation and pretty pathetic that they can't handle a Sunday morning delivery by noon) is through repeat customers.\n\nHere's how I tried to help their business..\n\n1.  I have referred this restaurant through my own business as a caterer for countless weddings and events. \n\n2.  I have passed out their cards at my shop located on off the strip. \n\n3.  I have verbally endorsed them throughout my social circle. I\n\nI really routed for this place in this economy. When my family has been in town I have taken them there and introduced the to the owners and staff.My support is withdrawn."
0,for all the hype and hoopla let me say very disappointed from the wait 30mins past our reservation to our server who lacked any enthusiasm to be pushed into the little room across the hall just disappointed went  tonight for my and friends 30th birthday it was 6 of us service was sub par fodd was just ehhhh defiantly not the best steak i ever had the bone in rib eye salad and sides were lacking for the price you pay here should be something that leaves you talking about for days how good it was asked for nonrosemary bread for one of the people we were with took 20 mins and 3 little slices one word to summerize is disappointed
1,Loved the atmosphere and the staff was pleasant. So far everything I have tried tastes great. Love the bacon mushroom spaghetti!
1,"I like this place despite its location in a strip mall. The food is really quite good and the drink list even better. It had a good atmosphere and our service was very good. We had a server that was a bit eccentric, yet very friendly and knowledgable.  He had us laughing and awaiting his return because he was so entertaining."
1,"One of the coolest places in Vegas! I definitely loved furniture shopping here. They have EVERYTHING. The shops are located in the 1st and 2nd floor of building A and 1st floor of building C. There are styles for everybody: from modern, wild and flashy celebrity, vintage, east coast old money, to california beach house styles. In addition to that, they have specialty stores that focus on sofas, solid wood furniture, pillows, paintings, rugs, chandeliers, and much much more. Some vendors allow you to buy and bargain directly with them while others require you to go through a designer. If you need a designer, their office is located next to mundo.  Prices here are much lower than retail stores. Also, it seems like delivery charge to out of state could be reasonable. Check out this place and be inspired by all the design! Also if you need a snack, head over to Mundo for great happy hour deals!"
0,I was very disappointed! Was visiting with friends from out of state we ordered food to have it delivered. An hour and a half later the food had not come I called and they said the lady had just left and would be there soon. Another 20 minutes later when the food arrived it was cold and greasy. When I called the restaurant I was told they should have told me they had that long of a wait duh! I spoke with the owner who whined and said that she didn't have enough drivers. My father are if the owner doesn't have enough drivers since you should hire them. It was a Monday night! Very sad and disappointed.
0,"Honestly wasn't the best ramen I've tried in Vegas. The gyozas (pot stickers) weren't as crispy and the broth was a little too oily for me. This is coming from a native Japanese girl so, yeah."
0,"So My husband and I wanted to take my Mom out to celebrate her promotion and she chose Blue Agave. She and my father and been once before with friends, and my Mom had been going on about their Bulldog Margaritas for weeks. \nWe made the trip out there and when we arrived went straight to the bar. We walked right past the man who would be out server and took a seat. The restaurant was slow, only and handful of people at the bar and it didn't look like there was anyone in the dining room at all. It remained this way through out the night. So I am confused on why our service was so slow. While we waited for our server, my father noticed that another server had to make the gentlemen we almost walked right into aware of our presence. I guess we were hard to see, being at a bar table right near the kitchen and all. Through out the night service continued this way. A little tip, apparently you have to order a beer twice for it to arrive at your table, or at least that was the case for dear old Dad. \nThe food was better then the service, but just barely. Charging 50cents a tortilla seems odd, but we went for it because we really wanted to try the agave butter. The butter was good, not mind blowing, but good, the tortillas were small. They can't even shell out the chips and salsa, so I'm not surprised that the portions were a tad on the small side, you get that feeling that they are just fighting to keep their doors open by charging you for every thing they can. I had the sante fe shrimp appetizer as an entree, along with a side salad. I enjoyed the shrimp, as well as the rice they were served over. My salad was nice, the cilantro dressing was boring, but I liked that they used Jimica in the salad. Dad ordered the Green Chili Cheese Burger, meh. My Mom and husband both had the enchilada style lasagna. After they each poured about half a bottle of the house made tapitillo on top it was pretty good. The server admitted that he too uses the hot sauce when he orders it, so they know its bland. Maybe they are trying to cater to the older crowd that seems to frequent the place? Spice is your friend people! \nWe had tried to order another round of those bulldog margaritas before happy hour was over, cause they were most definitely the highlight of our meal. Our drinks were empty, our food was nearly gone, and our server had been MIA for awhile, so when we noticed it was 8 minutes until happy hour was over we flagged down another server and asked him to tell ours to order another round on happy hour prices. Well, the drinks came, but when we got our bill we noticed they were not on happy hour. We had meant to ask our server about this before he ran the bill, he should have mentioned that they were full price, but didn't. Well wouldn't you know, the only quick service he provided all night was swooping in snagging that bill of the table. He had ran the card before we even noticed he had picked up the check. Very stealthy. \nSo basically I will be making my own bulldog margaritas at home."
0,"On the surface, a not bad hotel. Not in a great location, not a big Vegas extravaganza, almost Kimpton in it's redesign. But don't let the surface details fool you-this is a varnished cardboard mock up of a nice hotel. All the details are as cheap as possible, and you'll be nickle and dimed in unexpected ways, and screwed to big dollars signs in the ways you'd expect.  And the spa? I walked put after being kept waiting for 25 minutes for my appointment, so I can't speak to the actual experience (that was the hotel's unforgivable moment)\n\nTropicana is lipstick on a pig. Expect nothing, and it's probably worth staying here"
0,"I really like the food at Mellow Mushroom and I can honestly say I've never ordered anything I didn't like.  BUT, the most consistent thing about a Mellow Mushroom, regardless of the state or location is that the service is painfully, exasperatingly BAD!\n\nWe visited the Selwyn location about a year ago, and experienced the same bad service typical of other MM locations and never went back.  We headed out to this location at an off time - 3:00 p.m. on a Saturday - hoping that would improve our odds.  Not so.  Despite the place being half full, the three hostesses seemed confused and disoriented.  Lengthy wait for a server, we ordered our drinks and food (knowing you have to seize the opportunity at a MM), and after her departure a second arrived immediately after, confused someone else helped us.  10 to 15 mins go by with no drinks and another server notices us and asks if we've been helped.  Very nice of her to check, but who's running this ship?  Drinks did arrive and the salad and pizzas arrived relatively promptly for a MM.  The woman who set them down (yet another server), said my calzone was still cooking and would be out shortly.  Well, no calzone ever arrived and the rest of my family was almost finished by the time the server made it back.  She had no clue I'd never received my food. I told her I didn't want it anymore, given they were already finished.  She kindly found it in the kitchen, boxed it up and didn't charge us for it.  \n\nSo clearly I'm the fool for trying MM again.  I think I've finally learned my lesson.  If I absolutely must have a MM pie, I'll get take out."
1,"It seems odd to describe Cheap Thrills as a stalwart fixture of Montreal's downtown, considering the apparent uncertainty of a stone 3-story walk-up within a sea of skyscrapers, shopping complexes, and parking facilities, and the general shabbiness of its second-story location, but they've been around since 1971 and they're still alive and kicking, so there you go.  In fact, you might even consider Cheap Thrills something of an oasis, given the state of things.  \n\nThe thrills in question come in the form of LPs, CDs, and books.  CDs and LPs come new and used.  Books are strictly second-hand.  Most of the above qualify as \""cheap.\""  Cheap Thrills is a tiny operation, but the shelves run high and they're generally well-stocked with auditory and literary finds of all kinds.  On the music side, they specialize in rock, jazz, soul, indie, beats, and experimental, and their collection could safely be labeled \""savvy.\"""
0,"I've been to a few other Plato's Closet locations in the past, and figured that this place would be comparable.  I was wrong...mostly because there are a lot of other consignment stores that give this place a run for their money.  \n\nEven though they had their grand opening for this location last week, I still think that this place was a disappointment.  \n\nPros: \nlocation is easy to find (close to the mall)\na wide variety of stuff to choose from for both men/women--clothing, accessories, and more\nthey do have name-brand stuff, but you definitely have to pick through\n\nCons: \nparking can be a bit of a problem on the weekends, since it's shared and in a shopping plaza\nthe stuff tends to be a tad bit overpriced, smells funky (granted, it's a consignment store), and is jammed together (somewhat haphazardly)\nthe place doesn't have a lot of room to navigate and when there are plenty of people inside...it can be quite claustrophobic\n\nI'd be happy to return/update this review in the future, but for now, I'd rather go elsewhere."
0,Cheap but not great food. I like the all you can drink beer though. The waitress was a weirdo.
0,"Unspectacular. \n\nThe service was extremely slow considering I was the only customer in the afternoon and all I ordered was a burrito. \nThe place itself is pretty filthy, and the construction around the entire area makes it even tougher to get here. \n\nI would have to be pretty drunk the next time I come in"
1,"Visiting from SoCal. Husband's favorite meal is breakfast. Butterfield's passed the test.

1,"So....Another hit during the annual girls' weekend at Vegas trip was Aureole.  You may have seen it on the Food Network Channel, they have a huge wine collection in a glass encased tower, and they have \""angels\"" girls on harnesses to retrieve the bottles.\n\nSince it was our last night in Vegas, we decided, what the heck, let's try the Tasting Menu....Seven courses...we can handle that!\n\nThe first course was a tuna tar tar, so different that the bluefin tuna at l'atelier...it was stacked on top of some sort of pear chutney....not really my favorite.  But the crab ravioli. God that was so good. \n\nSquab paired with pan seared froie gras.  God. so good.  The froie gras was so perfect. one of my eating companions had a near orgasm over it, much to the chagrin to the rest of the table.  But inwardly....yes, it was good.\n\nThe filet mignon was seared to near perfection, and with the shepards pie.  yummy!  And with a bottle of nice red, the food kept getting better and better.  the dessert, not too found of. \n\nSort of neat, as the Chef came out to the table and talked a little bit with us.  Nice guy, sort of quiet. Not the personality you would think that a Chef would have.  I've alwasy thought of kitchen industry to be a foul language, rough and tough gang, with tattoos, chemical dependence and possibly a rap sheet......\n\nFood! Great! Would I go again.  Yes.....Damn, vegas has a lot of great places to eat!!! only so little time, and not enough stomach space.  And an added plus, that L'atelier didn't have....a really hot waiter. Hmmm....maybe next year!"
0,"My husband and I went there recently.  We are new to the area, so we looked up reviews re: this place.  People had great things to say.  \n\nUnfournately, our dining experience was awful. First, the Seaford Specialties were not so special.  I had the broiled jumbo shrimp platter with red potatoes.  The shrimp was not jumbo (stringy) and the red potatoes were boiled brown idaho.\n\nMy husband had the surf and turf. Steak was leathry and fried shrimp were out of a frozen box. Also, his side dish was to be rice pilaf. This was not the case.  It was some sort of microwavable rice.  All of the items on our dishes tasted like forzen cheap food.  The place looks great.  Food garbage.\n\nWe did not send anything back.  Due to the fact I do not trust any employee.\n\nI sent an email the next day to the restaurant.  Let's just say their slow to repsond.\n\nI DO NOT RECOMEND THEIS PLACE AT ALL!"
0,Just got back from staying at The D. While I love what the new owner has done with the place. Whoever he hired to set up and staff the D grill really dropped the ball. Took twenty minutes to get seated in what we found out was a half empty restaurant. We were told that we had to wait so that our server could prepare for us. Well.... He should have prepared better. Long story short. 6 people walked out.
1,"I'm bumping them down to 4 stars. I still think this is a great local place, but their kitchen tends to be heavy handed with sauces.  The last time we went I got the panko crusted pork chop. It was a huge, tender cut but was drowning in a soy sauce-based sauce that was way too sweet. The service, as always, was excellent and they have Fat Tire on tap for 3 bucks. I'll still come back, but their cooks really need to lighten up with the sauces."
1,"We've been here a few times with our boys and on our own. With or without our children the stay was enjoyable! The property is clean & beautifully located on Lake Las Vegas. It really gives you a sense of being away with the convenience of being 20 minutes out of town! They have a fantastic family pool area, a beach entrance area on the lake and a upper pool area if you're staying without the kids! The restaurants are a bit limited if you want to stay at the hotel the entire time, especially when we had our children with us. It's perfect for a \""staycation\"", but if they want to attract someone other than locals they should try to provide some sort of evening entertainment. A Saturday night DJ or a Lakeside band would be ideal because once you've spent the day in the sun & eaten your supper there's really nothing left to do."
0,"We went in for dinner a little later in the evening and were seated in the dining area and then waited, and watched other tables seated after us get service, and waited...  Just about the time we were about to go to the host stand and let them know we hadn't gotten any service, we noticed one of the servers who clearly wasn't even on the clock anymore go nudge another server and point to our table.  The one that wasn't working walked past our table and told us our server would be right with us before continuing on with whatever sidework she was doing.  We then watched our server finish bussing a dirty table, and then go to the bar to get drinks for another table, before finally coming over to take our drink order.  She never apologized for the wait, just took our order and walked away.\n\nThe food also was not very good.  I got a buffalo chicken wrap which was pretty bland.  That kind of surprised me for a restaurant with \""Buffalo\"" in the name.  My girlfriend got one of their burgers that was on special.  It was slathered in beer cheese which had soaked through one of the buns.  She ended up just discarding that bun and eating the burger and other bun with a fork and knife.\n\nI can't see us going back anytime soon."
1,"I fell in love with this place. In our short 3 day trip to Phoenix, we stopped by twice...and we didn't get much free time, so that's pretty big. \n\nThe space is large and open, I'm surprised there aren't more students here studying. There is plenty of seating, and the coffee is delish. The chai is unbelievably delicious.\n\nThe food here seems to be just so so for me. I got the big ben, and it's like eating a giant omelet stacked inside of an english muffin. The sauce to egg ratio was definitely off, and when we asked for more sauce, we didn't get any, even though they promised to bring it out. \n\nThe onion jam on the other BLT sandwich is AMAZING. I wanted to spread it over everything.\n\nThey got a knock down because their service is not the best, and the food was a bit underwhelming, especially compared to the drinks. The chai is thick and syrupy, almost a little too much, but it's great both hot and cold, but I prefer it iced."
1,I've been coming to this location since they opened. Before that I would drive to Scottsdale. Try the butcher's block and the different bruschettas split with someone.
1,"This place has the feel of a great coffee shop,  with leather padded seatting (Even the high tops) but worth healthy foods & a juice bar instead of coffee.  Just finished a wonderful meal with my boyfriend.  I started with the kale, cashew & cranberry salad that was full of flavor.  Then I had the protein burrito filled with steak, quinoa, avocado & arugala. My boyfriend had the Ruben on a raisin walnut bread. Everything is made fresh daily & it shows. The staff is very friendly & helpful.  We will be back."
1,"The Bellagio Pool Cafe is delicious but expensive... under a nice covered area, you can enjoy a wide variety of lunch options in your swimsuit and towel. By the time we sat down around 2:30 pm, I was starving so I ended up sampling everyone else's food in addition to my own.\n\nI had the teriyaki chicken lettuce wraps ($12.50) that came with cold noodles, pickled, veggies, and hoisen sauce. They were really yummy and a good amount of food. My uncle enjoyed the Cobb salad (about $14) that included fresh tomatoes (red and yellow), delicious avocado, etc. My brother and dad shared a tuna sandwich and a turkey sandwich with fries and cole slaw. Everyone appreciated their lunch selections and left the Cafe satisfied and happy."

That is pretty typical results for males if you stick with the diet. I also completed 30 days from another clinic two years ago and lost 30lbs. \nInitially I made an appointment to talk to the doctor and he wasn't there so that was a wasted trip. I wanted to start the diet soon so I went to there north Las Vegas location to see the doctor sooner then waiting a week for him to return to the green valley location. Despite the fact that I told them I would be going to the green valley location only they assigned me a diet coach at the north location. When contacting him it always seemed like I was wasting his time so I stopped talking to him. The diet cost $900 for 43 days and after 7 days he never got back to me. They had a sale when I signed up, normal price is $1200. I finished the diet with good results but it had nothing to do with the overplayed diet coach. I find the HCG diet to be great but unfortunately you have to get a doctor to write the prescription for you so you have to go to a clinic like this. With all this in mind if you have unlimited funds go for it. But don't expect much from the staff. Just follow the diet plan and you'll do well."
0,"This place is great if you have no insurance and/or need a lot of work done and need to get on a payment plan. For those situations I would recommend Western Dental. (Maybe not this location)\n\nFor me, my experience was not so great. I left always wondering what happened, am I done, do I need to do anything else. \n\nThe dentist I had, they have a few in that office, was very straight to the point. A little too much for my liking. She never talked to me, asked me if I had any questions or concerns, never explained anything to me of what she was doing. I felt like she was rushing most of the time.\n\nThe staff seems great in person but whoever does the call befores is useless. I got a call to remind me of my appt and to see if I had questions. I did have questions but she couldn't answer any of them. So what was the point of her calling asking if I had questions. She should have just called and said your appt is at this time. Which she didn't even do that correctly. I confirmed that my appt was at 10a she agreed. The day of my appt I found my appt card while cleaning and it was at 11a. \n\nI got what I needed done there but now that that is over I'm getting my x-rays and going some place else."
0,"We were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm. The 2 of us got to Bar Louie at 8:30.  We sat outside, and it was nearly 30 minutes before the waiter even stopped to get our order.  I tried stopping a waitress but was told 'this isn't my table'.  Finally the waiter took our order.  1 Sam Adams light bottle, and one Pineapple Juice+Vodka.  After about 15minutes another waiter (maybe the manager I don't know) asked if we had been waited on. We said yes, and told him we had been waiting.  He left, and another (different) waitress came to bring us our drinks.. they were wrong.. My date was given vodka on the rocks. and I was given a Sam Adams.. \nThey took these back, and another 10 minutes before the correct order was served.. We told them to bring another round and the check.  It was 20 minutes before they returned.. and they forgot the check.\n\nBy this time we had to go to be on time for the movie.. my date asked for the check again so we could leave.. finally they brought it and I gave him my card, when he came back we signed it and left in a hurry to catch the movie.\n\nfor 2 bottle beers, and 2 pineapple juice + vodka I was charged $31.03. I didn't have time to complain or ask. I won't be going back."
0,"My mom loves this store, or rather the one in Indiana. I didn't find much to be excited about as the prices were still rather high and some store disorganization made it realty hard to find the awesome stuff."
1,"We really loved everything about this place! The food and service were both exceptional! The only thing there really is to complain about is the smell from a nearby nail place. That's not the restaurant's fault but if you have a sensitive nose or stomach it might bother you while you are eating. Good news though, they do to go! :) the carne asada was awesome and we will definitely be back!"
0,Everytime I visit there I wait at least 45 minutes before I make it through the waiting room door. Dr. Arnold has removed cancer from me twice. This last time I waited for 90 minutes and never made it through the door. Three other people who were there before me were still waiting. He gets high marks in skill. His office staff rates a zero for overbooking and rudeness. His bedside manner could use improving but his skill level outweighs that. His skill level does not excuse the length of time waiting. Doctor you are Fired!
0,"To celebrate the end of institute, and leaving Phoenix, my collaborate work group decided to have a celebratory dinner. There were 9 of us in all, and so it was suggested that we come here. Cool, whatever, brewery. \n\nFirst of all, the service was extremely helpful and attentive. From the beginning, our main server asked us how we would break down the check, and if it were possible to consolidate credit cards among us so we'd be able to get out faster. She was very polite and ready to accommodate, even though she was training someone new at the same time. \n\n When we arrived, someone immediately took our drink orders. Most of us started with cocktails, and 2 people got beers--big mistake on the majority. The Manhattan and Tom Collins my friends got were extremely watered down, with very little alcohol, and my SF lemonade tasted like lemonade. Only. Apparently the beers, though, were very good, and the next round, that's what everyone ordered. \n\nAs a group we decided to split appetizers: A chef's platter (with Southwest Chicken Eggrolls, barbecue buffalo wings, and potstickers), and 2 baskets of garlic fries. We were all starving after our last day teaching so we dove in as soon as the food arrived. The buffalo wings were sweet and barely spicy at all, although the chicken had a nice crispness to it. The Southwestern eggrolls were bland, so I dipped them in ranch, and the garlic fries were very greasy--the garlic was minced and spread over the fries, so there wasn't much flavor and since it was raw minced, somewhat intense.\n\nAt this point, we were starting to get full, when our entrees actually arrived. I tried: \n\nBeer battered fish and chips - The fish was NOT beer battered. It was breaded. Your generic whitefish, a texture as if fried after freezing, but drier than usual because of the breading. It was served with a mound of those same garlic fries and a \""Cajun roumalade\""--basic, orange tarter sauce that just tasted like tarter. I had to add a lot of vinegar and Tabasco to make this taste like anything.\n\nMarzen bacon burger - I had a bite of my friend's burger and it was pretty good: nicely charred meat, crisp bacon. I like my meat a little rare, though, and the burger was well-done all the way through, and a little tougher than my preference. \n\nSteak sandwich (don't know the actual name) - Another friend had a steak sandwich, which was a steak cooked medium rare with caramelized onions, a garlic alioli (or so she said, I couldn't taste it), gorgonzola, and arugula on a French roll, and the same ubiquitous garlic fries. The steak was pretty tasty and the sharp gorgonzola complemented it well. I could barely taste the arugula, however, and was in fact convinced it was actually spinach. \n\nOther people all had about the same to say about their food. It was too much and kind of bland. The portions of the food were pretty ridiculous. I know its a brewery but the plate was twice the size of my head. \n\nFor a watery cocktail and mediocre food, I paid about 26 bucks, which to me is just too much for something I'm unsatisfied with. 1 star for the service, 1 star for the ambience, which was pretty conducive to a group dinner (even with the Nascar racing on the flatscreens poised all about us). No stars for the drinks, the food, and the price."
0,"I could not be any more disappointed in this property. We made reservations 3 weeks ahead of time for a weekend in Madison for a football game. We got into town early and tried to check in at noon. They told us our room wasn't ready yet and that it wouldn't be till almost 3:00. Seeing as the game started at 2:30, we asked if we could leave our car in the lot and check in after 10:00 PM when we got back from downtown. We were told by the ladies at the front desk (Jody, I believe)  that it wouldn't be a problem and the reservation is already confirmed. \n\nWhen we returned to the property by taxi around 10:30, we were told that we lost our reservation because we weren't there by 10:00 PM. We explained to them that we tried checking in once already that day and we're told that coming back later wouldn't be an issue. Well it was an issue. A VERY BIG ISSUE! The manager, Justin, left a message on our home phone line at 9:07 asking if we were still coming. The problem here is, we weren't at home to get this message, and they had my cell number as the primary number on the reservation yet opted out of using it. It is now 11:00, we are inebriated and unable to drive and all of the hotels are sold out due to weddings and the football game. \n\nThey were unable to assist us in finding accommodations and were not willing to shuttle or compensate us on getting to a hotel we found 20 minutes away. I've heard of most hotel chains offering to pay for the room elsewhere, offer a free stay in the future at their property or something to that effect and Justin and his staff offered none of that. At their inflated rate of $189 for a room you would expect that the service would be incredible. WRONG!\n\nWe travel a lot and have never had a situation like this happen. The disappointment in the way that this location of the IHG treated us and our reservation will not be soon forgotten."
1,"Combo banh mi + Vietnamese Coffee\n\nThis location is in a strip mall and to me had quite a bit of parking.  I ordered the combo banh mi with extra pate and a coffee to go.  The dining area is huge and there was quite a bit of people that day,  they effortlessly went through the line and I received my sandwich and coffee in less than 5 min.  We took it back to the hotel and I was impressed with the size and filling.  Not only was there a decent amount of meat for me, but quite a bit of pickled vegetables.  The crunch in the bread made polish off the entire sandwich(also just finishing working out helped).  The coffee was sweet and served as a dessert.  Looking forward to coming back."
1,Have been searching for great Chinese food since we left the east coast......  2.5 years later we have found Chou's Kitchen.... #foodbliss
1,"I have been coming to Oggi's for awhile now and I have always had great experiences!  There are never a lot of people there and the food is served up quick.  They make their own beer and have a decent IPA which is very HOPPY.  They also have HOP JUICE!   If you're on a budget, just ask for a \""sample\"" of the hopjuice and they will give you one.  Whalla!  You just got a SHOT OF 14% beer for FREE.  Haha!  Anyway, the WINGS ARE THE BEST.  I get the killer wings and request them GRILLED.  I also love their pizza titled SLAM DUNK which is made with the WING SAUCE!!"
1,"Great service - very quick, definitely use the coupons - and the evaluation was honest and fair - and no pressure is applied - I would go back again"
0,"Unremarkable food. Nothing tastes like something I couldn't make at home. We ordered pancakes & scrambled eggs for the kids, hubby had eggs benedict and I had the jimmy cristo. Hmm. Just ok. Pricey for the food quality and we noticed a sanitation rating of 84 posted by the door. We won't be going back."
0,"I never leave reviews but after going to Clever Koi this weekend I just had too. I will start by saying that the drinks and ambiance  were very good. The vibe there is really cool. The FOOD on the other hand.... Was terrible. I wanted to like this place so badly. Growing up in Hawaii I have spent most of my life eating Japanese food. I have had Japanese food all over the country and in japan. Out of the 7 dishes we ordered only one person liked their meal. My ramen was so bad I couldn't finish it....and considering that the portion was very small that says a lot. I left hungry. I told the waitress that I did not enjoy the meal and that most of us at the table were very disappointed...she said \""oh I'm sorry. That's too bad.\"" And that was it. I've been working in service for over 15 years. I was very surprised at that response and that no one came over to ask about our experience or even to offer a drink or dessert. I didn't want or expect a comp of my meal but considering the reviews and that this place is newer I would think they would have tried to turn around a table of 7s opinion. If you want good drinks and ambiance...go. If you want great Japanese food I wouldn't recommend it."
1,"I cannot describe how many times I have driven past this place, as for a while it was on my regular commute.  Well, that explains why I would be in the neighborhood.  Unfortunately I would drive past because it looked like there was no possible way it could be open for business.\n\nYou know the stories of how bridges and castles are brought over from other countries brick-by-brick, then reassembled?  This parking lot is like that, only the historical purpose here is so that you will know what it is like to traverse a minefield (minefields exploded leaving giant holes in the asphalt) from the Korean War.  While there are not a ton of businesses inside the mall itself, it would be nice if there was at least one path to the mall that allowed you to not require to get your car aligned.\n\nThe reason being is that there are some good businesses within.  Le's is perhaps the best purveyor of Banh Mi in Crown Town.  Pho Daravan also offers Banh Mi, but not as deep a selection - in fact they only had one when we were there.  Not one to choose from, but a single sandwich (they ran out after we ate that one).  They do have pho, however, and a plant that seems to sprout from a single pot to take over the entire restaurant.  And there is perhaps one of the most interesting restaurant supply stores you will ever find (though the quality of some items may be suspect).\n\nYou can also find a number of Asian-themed businesses and even outreach services, and generally there are detailing services in the parking lot too.  What they really need is a good quality auto service to provide that alignment.  They would make a killing.  Of course, as you leave, they would just need to do it again."
0,"Wow I didn't want to believe the bad reviews, but now I do... Horrible horrible\nService and I only got the take out.  These people need to go to finishing school.  I never review places, but after that experience I feel it's my duty to warn people before wasting their money on a bad experience.  Jose Andr\u00e9s needs to come back here and clean house."
0,"It should not be called \""rainbow pho express\"", instead it should be called \""Pho Slow\"".\n\nThe service was horrible!  Very slow service and they bring food in your table that you did not order, and the food that we ordered took so long to arrive."
0,"I used to really like this place... But I must say I have converted to chipotle. Cafe rio is much less healthy than chipotle and since I am allergic to gluten, there is almost nothing gluten free on the menu. Even the rice and beans have gluten in them! There is no reason for there to be gluten in rice or beans. I guess they put a lot of extra stuff in their food."
0,Disgusting and dirty!  Don't go!!!
0,"Ate here today and have been here plenty of times before. unfortunately the food quality has come way down and the service was very  very bad, so much so that we will never go back. Was always one of our top choices for Korean BBQ, but now toward the bottom of our list. First time we have been here where restaurant was empty.  And now I know why."
0,"This is another bad restaurant by a LLC with big aspirations.  I only wish their business ambitions were in pace with their product, but it's not even close. \n\nWhen I initially had walked in to the restaurant I really did like the dark hued deep red tones, and the geometric lines of the interior, but that was probably the high point. \n\nThe restaurant was also dead empty, and that should've been a warning sign, but we were starving! \n\nI ordered the Kalbi, Bulgogi, and beef tongue. Unlike other Korean BBQ's, San Toki (\""snow bunny\"") only gives you a whopping three side dishes, and any additional side dishes were $2 to $6 more. Even rice was charged. I'm surprised they didn't charge me for water and chopsticks. Now, is it wrong to charge more for these items? No, it's not, but people accustomed to traditional Korean BBQ's are going to have different expectations, and this business has failed to manage expectations of what a Korean BBQ typically is. Not only did they not live up to price, but they failed on portions. The kalbi was cut away from the bone and cut up into tiny little cubes which was great for presentation, but it's a wasted unnecessary step. All 3 of these dishes failed to feed two of us, yet alone 4 people. \n\nNow onto flavor, I have no idea how this place can survive other than from unsuspecting out-of-town naive tourist who have no idea what Korean BBQ should taste like, but I suppose that's their proposed business model that they plan on surviving on because taste and quality isn't it. They couldn't even deliver on the sauces because they  tasted so bad because they decided to do some sort of \""FUSION\"" gochujang type sauce instead.\n\nAfter coming to this restaurant, I wonder if their other restaurants were also as bad as this one. If they are, I could only assume if they're as superficial as this restaurant they won't be able to expand outside of Vegas or sustain itself unless they get their act together. I also wonder if any of the principle's behind this company even work at any of the restaurants. I highly doubt it.\n\nThe biggest insult was when the person who appeared to be the manager inquired with a \""how did we like the food\"", and I knew that once I opened my mouth, everybody else would want to sink down into their seat, but I had to be honest and say \""this is the worst Korean BBQ I have ever had\"". His response was \""well, that's unfortunate, but that's odd because we have the TOP KOREAN CHEF IN LAS VEGAS\"". Of course I laughed at that, and I now take pity on Las Vegas for having such bad Korean food because if that's the best Vegas has, I feel for the people of Nevada. He had also asked what Korean BBQ restaurants have I been to and I mentioned a half dozen in K-town, and the guy I was with just got back from a business trip from Korea, and he was treated out to Korean BBQ by one of the dept heads of one of the divisions of Hyundai. I guess after that response, it was fairly reasonable that our response seemed somewhat or slightly valid."
1,"Found myself on the Westside and of course had to sample some well reviewed and well rated Pho! This is very nice Pho and fortunately for me I have four I ranked slightly higher that are closer to me in the East Valley, as this is very far to go for Pho. VERY nice broth, lots of meat (although a couple of pieces were a little tough) served by the little Vietnamese Lady who obviously is responsible for its delicate flavor. Beats out lots of very well regarded \""Pho Joints,\"" quite handily. Nice surprise and very close to my #3 ranked Pho Phind!"
0,"I live close to El Gordito super market, I go there NOT so often, there are flys EVERYWHERE! The hot and ready food that is out to serve is always left open. The food gets dried, they still serve it that way! Dried food + flys = NASTY! I Bought a Torta and when I tried it, the meat was ROTTEN. Tasted Disgusting! Also, You can see Flys in the glass display, where the Bread is in! Gross!"
0,"I was so disappointed by this place. First, the decor is pretty cool. A very laid back atmosphere with picnic table type tables in part of the restaurant. \n\nI ordered the bean and queso dip, some chicken skewers and the fried ice cream. The food was fairly flavor-less. The fried ice cream was a complete let down. The service was extremely average. Add all of these things together and I would probably swing by for a late night if I had to soak up some alcohol...but that would be it. It just was nott that good."
0,"I'd like to update my review of Red Carpet VIP. Based on my experience, I would not feel comfortable saying that \""I'm a fan\"" or even that they're \""A-ok.\"" My friends and I did get that refund we were waiting for. However, this was only after I had requested it more than once and been accused of lying.\nI've added a star because a representative that I had not dealth with during my stay in Vegas reached out to me with an apology for our subpar experience and a promise of a better experience should I try their services in the future.\nI am glad to read that other Yelpers had a much much better experience than my friends and I had. Hopefully, our experience was simply a fluke and not due to anything else."

0,"We visited for a sit-down brunch Saturday morning around 11ish, and it was busy, as expected. We only had to wait for 15 minutes, which wasn't bad. The place is very large, with plenty of seating, so that probably helped.\n\nIf they are going for a full and authentic New York City vibe, they nailed it. The service is what you would expect from a cheap 24-hour NYC diner. Our waitress was overwhelmed, and whenever she did finally get around to helping us and taking our order, it was as if we were inconveniencing her and we're not ordering fast enough. She didn't have the Brooklyn accent to go with the service, but the hostess's booming Brooklyn voice that you could hear throughout the building covered that area plenty.\n\nThe food was okay. No complaints, but nothing outstanding, either."
1,"I had a great experience. I waited a LONG time before getting my legs waxed and she was very nice about it. She even offered a touch up next week.  Made me feel so comfy and I will be back for sure! For just meeting someone and lying there in my underwear, it felt like she was family. I will not go anywhere else!!! You shouldn't either!"
1,"I saw someone walking down St Denis with ice cream between two macaroons, and needed to have it. \nShop is super small, but nice and clean, staff was quite helpful when I said \""Great how do we do this?\"" They have sorbet, cones, gelato...not many flavor choices but really how much stimulation do you need? I opted for two (yes I ate them both) little ice cream sandwiches. Strawberry cheesecake between pink macaroons and cookies and cream between chocolate macaroons. Very delicious, and $2.50 each! Yum!!"
0,"I did not have the desserts and maybe they're good.  However, I had a wrap from the deli case, and I have had better from an airport.  The chicken seemed process and undercooked.  Salad had wilted lettuce.  \n\nI expected more but I probably shouldn't have.  It was food from a deli case under an escalator in a mall."
1,"No complaints and we'll go back again for further exploration.  The kitchen menu is pretty interesting.  I like a sushi place that has other items that are easy to peruse and choose.  We had the salmon with sweet corn and loved it.  Eager to work our way through the other kitchen items.  The sushi was fine;  it didn't blow my mind but it was very good and honestly, it's nice to have a sushi place right in the middle of it all.  This is a very welcome and classy addition to Desert Ridge, right by the theater, (and good riddance to lame old San Felipes.)"
0,"So very nearly a 3 star - this place is 2.5 (why can't yelp do half-stars like flixster?)... the place is a conceptual hodge-podge priced for the super-rich. I felt uncomfortable there - but a lot of that has to do with my occasional social anxieties. Still, Canal oozed pretentious asshole (present company excluded). I can't even call it douche because douche can't afford this place on their waiter wages. \n\nEven if I had this kind of money, I wouldn't go here ever... it's just not for me. I liked some of the concepts and the runway and curtains looked kinda neat... but then the exposed pipes on the ceiling looked like a cross between cool and gross as some of them appeared to be sewage lines - why would I want to have a meal with sewage lines running along the wall right next to my plate? \n\nThe menu was also this odd hand-made confusion... everything about this place was one-off. Even the appetizers had attitude - a simple bacon and cheese finger sandwich clearly aspired to be more. It was delicious, but c'mon. I didn't drink anything - I simply had a diet coke. The server was very nice, but brought my coke out with a huge lemon slice on the rim which left seeds in my drink. Odd. It's relatively new though, I'm sure the kinks will get ironed out over time. \n\nI'd like to see a fancy-pants place like this serve a turd pate - like plate up the shit they scoop out of shrimps and garnish with mint leaves - and charge 80 bucks for it... I bet people would eat it and pay for it. Bah. \n\nSarah and I wandered around the mixed shops and arrived at the end before realizing it was more than one store. They all sold the same crap - most of it was grossly overpriced. Again - this goes beyond douche - the clothes were more stylish and simple and much more expensive than douche can afford. To be honest, much of it was quite nice -but still, if I had a billion dollars, I'd feel like a fraud paying 800 bucks for a casual jacket or 300 bucks for a t-shirt. Wasteful. \n\nI am surprised that this sort of thing has permeated this far south - I thought it was a North Scottsdale thing. I'm discouraged because I don't like the crowd this sort of place will attract, but at the same time I like what it'll do to my property value. The reputation Scottsdale has really bums me out because I live here and I love it here. There are so many places to go where you don't have to encounter the douche-ness. It's just becoming increasingly more difficult to convince anti-Scottsdale people to come. Eventually everyone here will be bobble-headed plastic robots with too much money and no taste... I'll be consumed or assimilated or destroyed.\n\nI do have a feeling that the bottom will fall out and this mansion of cards will crumble to the ground - Scottsdale is living beyond its means. Or perhaps 'if you build it, they will come' is the thinking. This is a strange time indeed. \n\nIt was my first Yelp event and I realize Sarah and I were antisocial - I attribute much of it to the setting... which was unsettling."
1,"I have been to every ballpark in the Cactus League and know my way around them all.  This is, by far, the best facility in all of Spring Training (that includes the Florida parks).  Granted, I am a Dodger fan and we get it better than the 'Sox fans do, but it is still amazing.\n\nCamelback Ranch is the brand new, state of the art, spring training facility for the Dodgers and White Sox.  The Sox moved from Tucson because Tucson is the literally SO bad that even people from CHICAGO won't stay there.  The park is located just south of the Glendale Airport and pretty much only has one way in or out - 111th Ave.  You can avoid Camelback Rd by taking Indian School to 111th and then just drive into the stadium.\n\nThe grounds feature 13 practice fields and a giant lake and river that also help irrigate the fields.  While the White Sox practice fields and clubhouse entry are blocked off from the public, the Dodgers' are wide open and inviting.  Players must walk through the crowds during practices which invited lots of interaction with the fans.  \n\nThe field is beautiful and the layout of the stadium is quite impressive.  Not only do they have a full Jumbotron but they also feature fully enclosed suites and a full buffet for those willing to shell out $90 per game.  That price gets you seats behind home, access to unlimited food, wine, beer, soda, and sweets.  It also gets you exclusive merchandise as well as cold towels to help you cool off.  It sounds like a lot but it turns out to be worth the money.\n\nThe grass seats have a great slope to them (much like Scottsdale) and the seat aisles are wide.  The food selection is lacking without Dodger Dogs, however.  The stadium is also missing the independent food vendors that Maryvale and Peoria feature.  \n\nA great stadium and surely one to visit every March."
1,"I went here for a great dinner with two of my favorite colleagues. First thing, don't go or don't complain if you aren't there eating for an experience. This place definitely takes it's time and you should takes yours while you eat.\n\nWe had several antipasto dishes along with gnocchi and beet ravioli to start. All of the starters were killer. I can't say I was overly impressed by their charcuterie but the other dishes made up for it. For the meat finale we shared a dry aged bone in rib-eye and their 9 month (yes, average human gestation period) NY Strip. Holy hell. Cooked to perfection and their aging method is sound. Really killer steaks.\n\nWe topped it all off with champagne and cognac. No complaints with service. All in all it was a great night with great food.\n\nThe only thing I would give a -1 star for is the price. Comparable meals are available at a fraction of the cost but you get \""The Strip\"" markup I feel at this place. Fortunately for me I didn't pay but still, for the sake of being fair...."
0,"My wife and I live nearby and really like the atmosphere and clientele at the Crispy Crepe. However, the last two times we've been there have been bad experiences. One time we were seated outside, ordered our food, and waited more than 50 minutes before it came out. The second time, we ordered an Egg, Bacon, Cheese omelet for brunch to go, and when we got it home it was a vegetable omelet - not even close! If you can't get my order right, and when you do, it takes almost an hour, I will definitely take my business elsewhere."

1,"Love Pita Jungle!  They have tons of good-looking, healthy things on their menu, but I always stick with a few of my favorites because they are so good (hummus with chicken, chicken shawarma pita, grilled vegetable salad).  Their kids meals are fabulous.  My son loves them and they are nutritionally balanced, not your regular Happy Meal or nuggets and fries.   I confess to once getting two of them to go and acting like there was another kid in the car but my three year old and I ate them.  Also, try the Happy Hour where they have lots of yummy snacks for a very reasonable price.  I have not had any problems with the service or attitude.  I like this location a bit better than the Shea one because it's quieter, partially the acoustics, I think, but it may also be a little less busy since it's newer."
0,"The doctor we saw over the weekend prescribed the wrong medication for my very sick 7 year old!! Imagine my horror when I found out two days later when I took my child in to see our regular pediatrician on a Monday. One drug was way too strong for my child's weight. The other was an outdated drug doctors hardly ever prescribe anymore because there are newer, more effective drugs to treat the illness. And that prescribed drug is not even approved for children!!! Oh, and get this, the diagnosis/medications were given without a swab test to confirm the illness. I am so appalled and angry that my child was a victim of such terrible medical care.\n\nIt's too bad because I had a great experience with another doctor when I had come to get treated not too long ago. But it was a different doctor who seemed more familiar with current medical practices. \n\nBoth doctors I've experienced are retired and working part time at the clinic - that should tell you something about this clinic's hiring practices. If you have no where else to go but Urgent Care Extra, cross your fingers that you'll get a good retired doctor who has bothered to stay current with new medical/medicinal advancements!"
1,"Received great assistant from the new manager on-duty, was told that he's the new branch manager or one of them, Michael L.  Needed some money exchange from another branch and couldn't get it and was told to stop here.  Easy and painless process, will definitely recommend this branch if you are in the area."
0,"I have been coming here since this place opened and it never seems busy. The menu is just okay and the drinks are nothing spectacular. However, there always seems to be a really bad smell around the restrooms here. They have no shortage of drink specials but there are more happening places in the area. Unless they fix the smell and do something to draw better crowd, I don't see this place lasting more than another year. :("
1,"The men of OGs... *sigh*.  I can't imagine visiting Vegas without making a pit stop here for at least 2 hours.  I thought I was gonna cry last weekend after taking a peek into my clutch and realizing I left my ATM card at the hotel.  Looking back, it really was a blessing.  This place brings out the devil in me."
1,"This place made an otherwise near-miserable trip to Vegas (here's a tip: never stay off the strip, no matter what) tolerable. In fact, if I focus on this, I can almost forget the taste of smoke in my mouth, the toothless guy with the cracked hands that kept grabbing my arm, and the horrendousness of my off-the-strip suite in hell.  \n\nI loved the feel of sitting on the \""patio\"" in the square. I loved the fried squash blossoms - the bit of ricotta was completely unexpected and delicious and I can't wait to have it again.\n\nThe blood orange cosmo was divine, not at all syrupy like other cosmos, and it lacked the bitter after taste I sometimes get with cosmos made with orange vodka. \n\nAnd then there's the pizza. I'm giving up pizza for a month because the Pancetta with carmelized onions and goat cheese was as good as pizza gets. The tomato sauce was fantastic, a little tangy, which I adored. The goat cheese wasn't too earthy like goat cheese sometimes is, and well, how can you go wrong with pancetta and onions? The crispy thin crust was still chewy, too. Hooray! \n\nSeriously, when in the Venetian, head down here in the afternoon, ideally just before the mimes start a performance (ask for a seat that allows a view) and order yourself a glass or two of Prosecco or some blood orange cosmos. Order the pizza (any will do) and try yourself some fried squash blossoms...you'll thank me.\n\nAnother tip: Don't go to any off-the-strip buffets, even if 16 of your friends are going there for dinner. You'll regret everything about that decision."
1,"My experience with Dr Payne and staff was AMAZING....  Not only did they take such good care of me they took care of my entire family.  I recently went back in to buy my first pair of nice fashionable sunglasses and they not only helped me find just the \""right\"" ones for my face, They treated me like a celebrity.  And the best part is they gave me such a smoking deal.  I would NEVER go anywhere else."
1,"My first stop in Phoenix was the Fry Bread House and I instantly started a fry bread addiction for the rest of my stay. The surroundings are nothing fancy and the food comes out in disposable containers, but its delicious and extremely cheap. I particularly recommend the green chile stew that comes with a side of fry bread."
0,"Ok so my friends talked me into going back and giving it another shot.  Mistake.  If possible, service was even worse.  I was there on Thursday evening and when we arrived it was virtually empty.  The servers would literally walk by our table and look at us but not come over.  We finally talked to the manager, Mike, and that helped.  The food was very good this time.  Still not a place I would choose to go."
0,"This place was a bad decision we made on the night we got here. My wife and I had been flying all day and were hungry and this was all that was open, we were seated next to a fountain that made us wet the entire time. Our waiter was garbage and took over an hour from the time we sat down until we had food.\n\nOnly about 10 people were there so it wasn't busy. Should have taken it as a sign. Anyway we finally got our food and it had been sitting under heat lamps for a while as everything was dry and cold. Thanks to our garbage waiter our experience was atrocious. \n\nI understand this place is aimed at children, but if you are charging the same price as a five star restaurant you're shit better be in a row. Don't eat here go anywhere else."
1,"Come here every year when I'm in Scottsdale for Spring Training. After a night of drinking and sporting a huge hangover this place saves me every time. The portions are huge  and the service is quick and friendly. Sometimes there's a long wait to get in though. It's a painful walk here from the hotel, but I leave with a skip in my step to Scottsdale Stadium"
1,"Experience is the key word for me, when describing R+D. \n\nIt's not often you wait in a dark alley to go someplace swanky. Once called, up you get a briefing and an Inquisition: \""been here before? familiar with the rules? any food allergies?\""\n\nYou get directed to your spot. Intimate as you want it to be... make eye contact and someone may ask you about your drink -- or tell you about theirs. Don't make eye contact and you'll be left alone.\n\nYou must order from the menu. No tweaking (i.e. club soda instead of tonic is NOT an option).\n\nEach cocktail is hand crafted and takes 3-10 minutes just to MAKE. Some are performances in them self! Dramatic flaming tequila falls; bubbling \""gin\"" being distilled before your very eyes, complete with a lesson on the history of gin. \n\nPrices range from $11 - $18/drink.\n\nA very unique special occasion experience!"
0,"Mixed feelings about this company. The dispatch staff was polite and concise and the driver was a great guy. However their biggest fail was the actual service.\n\nAfter my initial call I was told a driver was on his way (via dispatch and SMS). Ten minutes later I receive a call from the driver asking where the street was located (don't they have GPS units?).\n\nAfter giving directions I waited... 30 minutes later no driver. Called dispatch again and they said they'd contact the driver. \n\nWaited another 15 minutes and at this point I was getting annoyed. I could have easily been at my destination by now if I had taken the bus! So much for speedy service.\n\nI called dispatch yet again and they said they'd send another driver; after about ten minutes he arrived in a van. However I'm not sure who this van was designed for but it wasn't for adults. I'm 6' tall and my head was hitting the ceiling when I was sitting in the middle row. The seat's headrest must have been designed for kids because at it's highest point it was so low that it was pushing under my shoulder blades.\n\nWell over an hour after my initial call I finally arrived at my destination (which is normally only a 10 minute drive). Nearly a full-half hour slower than riding the \""slow bus\"".\n\nOverall nice staff but absolutely horrible service."
1,"Good music, great drink selection, great happy hour specials, nice appetizers and tons of seating and open space to enjoy it all.  It always seems to be hoppin on weekend nights, and they have great variety (for example, Reggae on Wednesdays).\n\nIt's a good-looking place, lots of wood and a nice layout.  The service seemed pretty good, but we were a large party spread all over the place, so it was really hard to tell.  Definitely a great stop if you live in the city, especially with the rest of City Scape for entertainment."
1,"I wish there were more stars to give! \n\nDr Steve is by far the best chiropractor I've been to. I'm a travel nurse on an assignment in Chandler and I hadn't been to a chiropractor in years but decided it was time to get my body back into shape. I found Dr Steve on yelp and I am so happy I did. To start, Carmen and Anasia are super helpful. Anasia knows what she is doing and both of them greet you with a smile always. Dr Steve is great as well, he is very intelligent but warm and friendly, he also remembered my name everytime I came in. Just like some of the other Yelp poster's said, he spends quite a bit of time with you and is very invested in your care; he certainly is very busy but I never felt rushed by any of the staff. He has young and old coming to him and I think that's a compliment to his treatment style. I appreciated his passion for results and working as a \""team\"" with me; He even offered to do some research on kinesio tape that I asked him about so we might be able to incorporate it into my treatment.\n\n I felt like he appreciated my input as to how I was feeling and he always answered any questions I had. He's very much into a holistic type of care. He has the up to date technology but also has the natural/holistic too. He put me on a program of several times a week and within the first few visits I was already in a better mood and sleeping soundly. He also has insight into diet and making your whole body better not just doing the physical manipulation.  Everybody that I met there was happy and felt great, so that obviously shows something about Dr Steve's skills as a chiropractor.\n\nI recently went on vacation then found out I was moving. I was so busy I didn't have time to call and let them know; but then they called me concerned about how I was doing because I hadn't been in lately. Now how often do you get that from a healthcare professional?? :)\n\nIf it wasn't for my job moving me around I would continue to come here. It was worth every penny and more!! I cannot say enough about Dr Steve and his clinic!"
1,"While I don't feel qualified to declare Dotty's the best burger place in town - it's a pretty fantastic burger place. \n\nMy personal favorite is the Runnelstone, whereas my partner is a lover-of-bleu-cheese so she prefers the Black and Bleu. Dotty's burgers are juicy - so juicy that the bun tends to get a little soggy. This doesn't bother me, in fact, it reminds me of the juicy goodness that is the legendary In-N-Out burger. \n\nWe always grab a regular order of fries, which is big enough to share between two people. I can't speak to any of the other appetizers, though others have praised the cheese curds. \n\nDotty's reputation as the best burger joint in Madison is a tough rep to live up to. You'll find plenty of 3 and 4 star reviews here that claim Dotty's doesn't live up to the hype. To each his own - but I recommend trying Dotty's out for yourself. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
1,"This place was off the hook with Flavor. Takes a while to get the fried chicken as they cook to order. Very rustic place, it is family owned.  The mixed greens were SOOO full of Flavor and the Black eyed peas were some of the best I've ever had. I left there totally stuffed. Nice portions. Many NFLers, MLBers, and musicians have signed the walls. Cool reading."
0,"I can't believe I didn't check the reviews before coming here. This place was disgusting. The price person was ridiculous for such cruddy quality food. \n\nWhere do I start off? I started with soup, as soon as I saw it from a far being swirled around by the chef standing by, I felt a little skeptical about getting it. You could automatically tell that shit was all starch, because it was soooooo thick. It was soooo bland, blegh. Crab legs? That stuff tasted so old, it was frozen cold too. And there's barely any meat. My boyfriend took advantage of their meat selection. He mentioned the meat was tough and bland. We are a big fan of truffle recipes. And they had macaroni and cheese made with some truffle oil. It was gross, it was all butter and a tiny dash of truffle oil to make it smell like it. \n\nThe only thing good about this place, in terms of food, was their unlimited crepes. I was able to get a dinner crepe and a dessert crepe after. Both were OKAY. \n\nThe staff that were working and taking our plates were very sweet. They refilled our drinks as soon as they were empty and they took our plates fast. I was able to converse with one of the chefs making my crepe, she was cool too. \n\nBut, I thought this place wasn't good. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Even one of our taxi drivers said that this place is one of the worst buffets here because we told him how we ate there."
0,"Good selection, usually helpful people working out in the plants, but customer service falls apart when you get to the counter--very slow. Bought a 15G tree last time, paid for planting, which was all fine initially. However, the tree lost nearly all its leaves within a couple weeks. We called them and they told us not to be concerned. Well, we waited for the tree to recover but it ultimately died; so called them back (now a few months later). They scheduled someone to come out to \""check it\"", but they were a no-show for the scheduled appointment. Called again, and the run-around started. NOW they needed an invoice number (provided) and were supposed to call back. No call back. Called again to check; no call back. Called to complain--no call back. We've just given up, on getting this tree replaced, as well as ever going back to Whitfill. Buyer beware."
1,"What can u say, this is Montreal meeting their version of Macy's. A touch class with a French twist. If you have never shopped here it is one of the main reasons why the people in Montreal look good, and can afford to go out and drink. Vive la Maison Simons!"
1,The rabbit!
1,"Service was 6 stars out of 5!\n\nMaggie was an awesome server, really friendly and met all of my annoying requests haha. Also, the busser was super attentive and my water was always full...much appreciated. \n\nI brought my girlfriend with me Thursday night for a date and we both left very happy. The dessert (Strawberry Hisbiscus) was very good, the brussel sprouts salad was good (ill probably get a different dressing though next time...but bacon ving. was still fine.)\n\nShe got the skirt steak, cooked perfectly as ordered and tasted fantastic. My king crab was too much to finish. The presentation was awesome, deshelled and neatly arranged on plate. It wasn't the best King Crab I ever had, but I definitely found it tasty. I'll definitely be back eventually. \n\nOverall, atmosphere and the service I got were perfect A+ grade and the food I'll rate a B+."
1,"I've kept my eye on Craftsteak as well as a couple other restaurants but I was feeling for a good flat iron two nights ago and choose this place over Fleur De Lys and Mesa Grill. \n\nHoly hell. I was so pissed to find out that Restaurant week in Vegas ended during the first couple days of my visit. I wanted the get the tasting menu that was $85pp but only $50 the day before! Should have punched myself in the face for that mistake.\n\nEither way, everything was freaking delicious. The strength of the meal came in the steaks, scallops and sides. Perfectly cooked to a medium rare. The appetizers were good, but comprised of nothing cooked, so it was harder appreciate dishes that came in various marinades and dressings (we had shaved fennel salad, cucumber and watercress salad, buffalo mozzarella and proscuitto with figs). I would've appreciated the roast quail but they were out for the night. Dessert was good too, I'm a sorbet girl so I loved the peach and chocolate sorbet. Tasted like cocoa ice cream without the ice cream texture that I don't like. We also had molten chocolate cake and monkey bread which my bf loved.\n\nPortions were HUGE. We could've fed at least 3 ppl with the food we received.\n\nService was great. The waiters weren't snobby at all, even though me and my bf were the youngest kids there. I was a little annoyed that they kept on referring to the Wagyu beef as Kobe...because its not the same thing. But the \""lead\"" waiter even recommended a cheaper tasting menu that fit our tastes better, instead of recommending the more expensive one that would result in a bigger bill.\n\nWhy the one star off? I'd like to see a better appetizer in the tasting menu we got. Also, I really thought the food was good but our bill came out to $275 for two people (we split 3 glasses of champagne) which I thought was hefty for food that was plain in idea and execution and not super innovative or unique. I think if I paid Restaurant Week prices I'd be a little happier but all in all, we had a great meal."

1,"Even though I don't speak French, I was able to participate in their Sunday afternoon class. I was recommended to this spot, and later found out it's attached to a Vedante Center. The vibe was kind of like Baha'i center; there was a cooking class and it smelt scrumptious, a kid's yoga class has just finished so there were people of all ages. The instructor demonstrated to the class what she wanted us to do, and would quietly explain finer points in English to me by the mat, which was loaned to me and all the props I needed. Occasionally she interjected English into the class, and was incredibly gentle.\nTr\u00e8s bene!\n\nAddendum; on their schedule, they list when they have bilingual/English classes. I went back to their open class (bilingual) and left with my body purring like a well loved cat"
0,"Good food, but they are so slow. I think they need to realize that lunch at a counter service place needs to be served quickly. I keep coming back every few months to see if they have improved, once they do I will be eating lunch here at least every week or two."
0,"The food was passable. The dining room was nearly empty at 7 pm on a weeknight. Not that I crave a crowded and noisy dining experience, but it would've been nice to think we'd made the right choice eating there by seeing other diners voting with their wallets.\n\nI don't think our waitress spoke any English beyond what was on the menu. She had to go get help from another waitress when I ordered a whiskey on the rocks. Even the more fluent of the two didn't think to ask me what kind of whiskey, so I was served rail that tasted like the ice cubes had come from a moldy dispenser.\n\nThe food was ok. Nothing special. I had the kung pao chicken. It lacked spice and came loaded with onions (which I had asked them to leave out)."
0,"This hotel is a clean descent hotel near the airport. If you have a car, this hotel is not an issue. The only bad experience I had was with their shuttle service. It was consistently late, from the first time we got picked up at the airport all the way till the time we left. You are most likely not going to be able to walk from the strip to the hotel. The last shuttle run is at 11:15PM, and it's a $20 cab ride to the hotel. The shuttle also only runs half an hour. If you are not interested traveling to the strip, this hotel is great."
1,"Pretty much what everyone is saying, a pleasant park with most of the necessities.\n\nYou can find most of anything here: volleyball, soccer, baseball, and basketball. They also have grills and picnic areas. For days you just want to relax.\n\nFeel free to bring your dogs too! Very spacious! Just make sure you clean up their poo poo :) \n\nOnly thing missing is a tennis court and its own dog park. That would make it 5 stars."
0,"Same as it was 20 years ago. Went for lunch after recently returning to the valley of the sun. Not much to write about my lunch. Portion was small. just some breaded chicken some sickeningly sweet sauce and some walnuts. Boring. I had the hot and sour soup that was oddly thick and had WAY too much tofu. The place inside was dark and old and seemed dirty. The bathroom opens to the dining area, so that made it seem worse. Probably wont be back. Disappointing. I remember something better. but maybe its because i was young and hadnt experienced a better place."
1,Was in Charlotte for two days and Merts Heart & Soul was recommended by everyone. Good food great location and I was impressed by the price. I went for Dinner Saturday then brunch on Sunday. I recommend it to
0,"I can't tell you how the food was because after waiting 10 minutes (with no line) to get a table, placing our order, and 20 minutes later with no chips and salsa, we left. I should've known to leave when the person sitting beside of us complained that his food had taken so long.  Terrible!!!"
0,"EDIT2: They charged my card AGAIN. I have now been charged four times for a one night stay. I've put a charge block on my card. Here's the saga on Vegas Chatter: http://www.vegaschatter.com/story/2012/9/4/162713/3521/vegas-travel/If+You+Stay+At+Golden+Nugget%2C+Keep+An+Eye+On+Your+Credit+Card+Statements\n\nEDIT: So, I'm fresh back from my stay this weekend and here's the rest of the story.\n\nA representative from The Golden Nugget called me on Friday and explained their billing software was not jiving well with AMEX and that's why the double charge again. He then told me I would receive $300 off the bill when I checked in.\n\nFlash forward to Saturday (my check-in day) - my husband and I check-in with surly employees at the VIP lounge, go upstairs, have a lovely stay in our suite. \n\nThen we checked out this morning and THAT's where the issues come up.\n\nThe employee who checked me out informed me we were booked to stay until 9/3. I replied to her that we had only booked one night. She then said, \""Well, whoever booked this online booked two nights. If you want to check out today there will be a $50 early check-out fee.\""\n\nI simply replied, \""No.\"" She did some typing and then, lo and behold, we didn't have to pay the fee anymore.\n\nI am utterly AGHAST at the amount and degree of billing errors I have experienced in booking one night with The Golden Nugget. From reading other reviews here, I believe this to be a systemic and reoccurring issue in this casino and hotel. \n\nI'll be calling the number of the gentleman who promised me everything would be fine during my stay to alert him to this. Even though I received a reduced rate, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone give these people their billing information.\n________________________________________ \n\nI wish I could give this hotel NO stars. \n\nThe Golden Nugget has now charged me $530 TWICE for a stay I haven't even HAD yet! Watch your credit card if you decide to give them any of your information. \n\nThe first time was when I originally booked my stay in July. I noticed a duplicate charge on my AMEX and called them about it. I was informed they had double charged almost everyone that day and were working on getting people refunds.\n\nThey did refund me but then...\n\nOn August 27 (two days ago), I received ANOTHER CHARGE for $530 on my AMEX from The Golden Nugget, THIS time it was filed under \""Specialty Retail,\"" which a customer rep told me meant someone had charged my card in one of their shops. I haven't even stayed there yet, so this means someone has either taken down my info and used my card to charge something or they have a dangerous glitch in their accounting system.\n\nI informed them of this and after more than 20 minutes on hold, I received NO apology, no compensation, nothing. They told me I have to talk to their accounting department. The hotel manager (Roxanne Yun) said they could do nothing for me and that she \""had no knowledge\"" of the SECOND duplicate charge on my card.\n\nBasically, they told me since it didn't show up on their screens (which, why would it? It's not attached to my reservation. It's a charge on my card from an unauthorized purchase in the gift shop.) it does not exist to them and they can do nothing for me.\n\nI offered to send them statements, written instructions, etc. and she repeated to me that I would just have to talk to accounting. \n\nAgain, I would not recommend you give these people your credit card information. I'm reporting them to the FTC tomorrow morning."
0,"I've been craving a good roast beef sandwich for a few days now, and finally had the chance to venture out someplace new to fill the near bottomless pit that is my stomach. This afternoon, my quest for a Roast Beef sandwich lead me to Jimmy Johns. And I will resume my search tomorrow, because, frankly, I was far from impressed with JJ's. And almost want my money back. \n\nAs stated, I wanted roast beef, and when i walked in and looked at the board, saw, what they have dubbed \""The Hunter's Club,\"" a sandwich purporting to have 1/4 lb roast beef, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and provolone. Bingo! That's what I wanted, so that's what I ordered. I rounded out my order with the combo, a medium drink and a bag of chips for 2$ more. Total came to 8 bucks and change for what I assumed would be the large. \n\nWell, its a one size fits all kinda place. Sandwich was barely larger then your standard medium at any other sandwich shop. Also, it wasn't cut in half, which isn't a big deal, but what I assumed was standard operating procedure for anything larger than a \""small\"" is to cut the damned thing in half so you don't poke someone in the face with the far end of your unwieldy edible. I ripped it in half myself, and when I went to get napkins, well, there weren't any to be seen. Had to ask at the counter for a couple. The girl gave me 1. \n\nAnyway, the sandwich. When I ripped it in half, I noticed that there was more lettuce than anything in the sandwich, and when I bit into it, my suspicions were confirmed. I was eating a Lettuce, Tomato, Provolone and Mayo sandwich. Oh, there was roast beef on there, but you could barely tell. I couldn't, to be honest. It was magical, my eye's said \""Hey look! Roast Beef! We Have Roastbeef!!!\"" by my tongue said \""WTF Eyes, are you kidding me? There's no roastbeef here! Trust me, i'm swirling around the damn product and can't tell its there! It's a monstrosity of Mayo, Lettuce, more Mayo, and Lettuce, and what I assume to be cheese! You lie, Eyes! You Lie!\"" Totally dejected and disappointed, I finished my near 9 dollar, 8 inch lettuce sandwich, and delved into the chips. \n\nChips, can't screw those up, right? Right. Well, maybe kinda. JJ has their own house chips, highly reminiscent of the Kettle Chips. Not bad, just really really REALLY salty. Caked in salt. I have no problem with salt, chips should have salt on them. That's fine by me, I enjoy me my salty chips. But this was like a salt lick. I'm sure some people enjoy them, but not my cup of tea. Speaking of cup of tea, that's what I had to drink. Lipton brewed Iced Tea. Best part of the meal, aside from leaving. And determining not to go back. \n\nThey deliver as well, proudly stating they will deliver even 1 sandwich. Silvermine does it. Cheba Hut does it. Dilly's Deli does it. Congrats, you've joined the guild of delivery sandwich shops, all of whom will deliver 1 sandwich. \n\nCome here only if you're a fan of generic, near tasteless food, that's over priced."
0,My wife and I stopped in here last night. We were seated promptly and our server took our order right away. We each had the baby back ribs. Both our orders were burned and the server never came back to check on us. It was the manager who finally came over and we sent our ribs back and he did refill our drinks. Not a very good experience.
0,"Oh man, what happened to you, Wicked Spoon? It's just not what I remember. The variety is there, but the taste is not. Almost every dish was bland! Crab legs, Asian dishes, American dishes, pastries, ice cream... Everything was just ok. Shrimp & grits was probably the best dish there. Bone marrow was gelatinous, tasteless, and probably the worst I've ever had in any restaurant. \n\nFor the price, I was very disappointed this time around!"
1,"This place is literally 50 feet from where I work. The noodles I ordered were amazing. They were quick to prepare the meal for take out too. You earned a customer, I'll be back for lunch next time! Service was good too, they offered me water while I waited for my food, even as a take out order.\nBasic orders cost 8$, add a few toppings and it can easily add up  to 11$"
1,"Cash is King.\n\nWas turned on to Los Mocajetes by a friend.  It's a quick drive from my work so it turns out to be my go to spot for a nice lunch.\n\nSpanish and English menu, pretty straight forward.  They don't try to flood their offerings with BS filler items, they go straight to their featured item as the first thing listed.\n\nThe Molcajetes (volcanic pot) is basically a mexican mixed grill served in a warmed pot.  You get a protein along with some roasted tomato sauce, some veggies, edible cactus stripes, and some mexican cheese.  Your protein can be chicken, beef, shrimp, octopus, pork rib.  My wife loves the Shrimp and Octopus Molcajete, the Beef is what does it for me.\n\nI've also tried their tacos, enchiladas, and quesadillas.  Surprisingly the quesadillas are pretty good."
0,"My husband and I just moved to the area and we got some promo in the mail for this place so thought we would check it out. I have to say, I don't understand all the rave reviews. The hostess was barely nice - didn't seem to care. The waitress kept looking away while we were talking to her and having conversations with guests at other tables while we were ordering. Don't get me wrong, she was nice, just not as professional as I would expect at a place in this price range - really ruins the experience. For example, my husband ordered the porterhouse with a lobster tail and she forgot the lobster, so after his steak arrived, he had to wait 10 more minutes for his lobster. I think she wasn't really paying attention when we were ordering. On the plus side, they were really fast with the food. \n\nThe pretzel bread is great and I definitely recommend the lobster rolls for an appetizer. \n\nI ordered the surf n turf. The lobster tail was huge which was great, but didn't taste very good - and I love lobster. The filet mignon was just okay and honestly I've had better at Outback Steakhouse for half the price. \n\nMy husband thought his steak was good, but not great. And for some reason his lobster tail tasted much better than mine. Though still not awesome. \n\nThe whole menu is al la carte so every side is an additional $6. I paid $60 for a tiny mediocre filet and one lobster tail and I can't even get some steamed broccoli with it? \n\nAnyway, we will definitely not be back. Not worth the money by a long shot."
0,"So we came in as a buddy said you have to try this place the El pastor rocks! I said ok Ill try it. Wow not good!\n\nFirst off I have to give them a 4 for service. Would have got a 5 but I had to ask for my chips after waiting 5 min. I mean really I have to wait then remind you to give them to me. First Fail!\n\nGot our food and I was not impressed at all when it came to the meat. NO I mean NO flavor in the El Pastor. I mean really Guy Fieri Has been here. This was horrible. How can any one say its good. My partner ordered chicken. it was OK until she got a large BONE! I mean really a bone!!!!  The manager could only say \""Oh we try and check for that but oh so sorry\"" This was all you could say? I mean pay for our meal make it better dont change the subject and talk about the kids. FAIL! You own this place and want people to return? Not like this you wont. You fail here and BAD!\n\nI will never come back here or recommend any one eating here!"
0,"I want this place to work!  Really do.   Visited On a Friday night in March at bout 1 AM with a total of 20 people in the club.  Slow to say at best and was told Sat night were 'off the hook'.\n\nOK so I visited Sat night and the cover was $20, I told them I was not paying $20 so they reduced it down to $10 - no harm in checking it out for 10 bucks  right?\n\nWell I gave them a $20 and they could not even break it!  Combined Front desk and coat check could not break a $10 cover with a $20 bill!  The till was completely empty.\n\nI left.  The outcome would of been obvious."
0,"Thought I would enjoy it quite a bit better than I did.\n\nBARSTAFF-Right off the bat we sat at the bar, in the food for some conversation, that usually comes from the bartenders at any place, however after having two menus thrown down with out anything being said, it started off very unwelcoming. Without the help of , what seemed to be the manager, the bartender girl never said one word to us except\"" see ya\"" as we got up.( the manager did everthing from take orders and make drinks, but seemed annoyed like she didnt want to be helping the obviously slow bartender)\n\nChow & Grub- Truffle parm fries were tastly,but take off the top ten fries and it looked like the bottom of the barrel , just crumbs and bits.My guy ordered the Samburger which he devoured,(literally, breathe baby!!) so thumbs up there! I oredered the Roasted chicken salad , that comes with pomagranate seeds and goat cheese. It was delish! I would high highly recommend this.\n\nThe Look- standard clean fresh peppy, Fox place, nothing stand out. Clean and fresh. Good looking staff. :)\n\nBreak it down Jess-\nGiven the greatness of my salad I want to give this more stars but the bad service and attitude was just too awful. It seems like a fun and fresh( yes I have said that) place and didnt pull its weight with such bad staff. The salad could be gotten elsewhere."
0,"I know I'm going to get crap for this but, oh well here goes...\nStarving, I go out into the vicious sauna that is Scottsdale in monsoon season, seeking food on a Sunday afternoon. After a couple of \""closed on Sunday\"" disappointments, I decided to go slumming at the always-disappointing Schlotskys Deli on Scottsdale. Lo and behold, shiny new Capriottis and Everything Bagel swooped in to save the neighborhood.  Yay... No wait, hold my calls, I'm not done. I walk in and the place is about 85* in the restaurant... Yuck. I walk up to the register to order and asked the very pregnant sweating girl how long ago did they take over Schlotskys.  She rolled her eyes, looked down, and said \""2 months, what would you like to order?\""  I ordered. Then she asked for my name to tag my order.  I told her my name.  Another giant eye roll and a (fuck it, who cares) shrug. She says \""I can't spell\"".  Because I don't normally care whether my name is spelled or pronounced correctly, even though, on this very rare occasion, I had pronounced it phonetically for her, I just blew it off. But then, right on the cash register screen facing me, was her spelling... \""corney\"".  I laughed. She scoffed... \""What?\"" She says. \""I'm just laughing at how you spelled my name.\"" Then she smirks and says \""it works.\"" And walked away without even looking at me. OK, kinda snotty.\nI walk down to where the food comes out, and the young dude making my sandwich is also sweating (no kidding)  and wiping the sweat off with the back of his wrist.  Whatever... it's Scottsdale.\nThe other kid working was on his lunch break. I could tell that by how he blew past me full speed, across the store, clumsily juggling a plastic cup and skidded 3 feet to a stop in front of an available table to eat at, and plopped his ass down. I hope he chose something caffeine free. \nLook, I know they're young, I know it's hot here, I know other guy is a spaz, I know she's pregnant, I can even surmise that she may not like her job, life, self... None of those things negate the fact that you (said employees) went out and got yourself a job in the food service industry... Serving others, food. Part of service is being polite. Another part is being professional. Where the f are the adults to corral these youngsters and teach them how to represent your business? Shame on you. \nOh, the sandwich was fantastic! Thank you, sweaty tall kid."
1,"This is one of my new favorite restaurants!  A friend and I had what equates to a vegetarian lasagna (I forget the name)...YUM!  And the mushroom risotto...YUM!  I had a nearly perfect martini, made just for me, with extra olives on the side just 'cause they love me (or so I would like to think)!  In other words, great service!  And it is a hop, skip, and a jump from home.  How could it be any better?  Seriously, I hardly ever choose Italian when I am eating out, but this place will make me rethink my choices every time!"
0,"I'm really sad.\n\nThe people that once owned En Sushi have sold the business. So what was once a good quality, very affordable Japanese joint has been converted to yet another subpar neighbourhood sushi restaurant run by people who don't know Japanese cuisine.\n\nLet me give it to you straight. If see a menu that has rolls that have 12 ingredients on it, run far far far away. \n\nAlthough my husband and I didn't order any rolls, our companions did. The rolls were the circumference of the bottom of a coke can. Topped with all these ingredients, how can all the individual flavours come through? What was the chef thinking? Well, obviously, soaking it a dish of sauce is an obvious answer to this question. If it wasn't messy enough already, it sure was one hot messy meal then.\n\nThis is not sushi. I don't have a name for this atrocity but it certainly is NOT sushi.\n\nIf the legit-ness of this place didn't plummet right then and there, it hit the proverbial rock bottom when they served the paper thin slices of sashimi, cut incorrectly. Inside I'm cringing because we told our pals that this place was good.\n\nTempura was overly hard and thick and wasn't nearly as delicious as it was from my previous review. Plus they seriously cut down the portion sizes from my last review.\n\nAnd a final note, they no longer have the ongoing offers for free food either that I mentioned previously. Even if they did, we will not be returning."
1,"Holy shit, $40 is a damn expensive buffet.\n\nBut... there are upsides!\n\n1. Crab legs (I don't like crab legs but for those who do they are huge and cut open for you - so gorging yourself is easier)\n2. Prime rib: uberly tender, best with the jus and horseradish on top\n3. Center cut slab bacon, yes meat eaters rejoice!!! Get ready for salty goodness and a heart attack - hey at least you've lived!\n4. Fish: tons of ceviche choices, sushi, baked fish, you name it, they've got it.\n4. Cheese/ dried fruit/ italian meat selection - wow, they have got quite a spread: prosciutto, salami, mortadella, parmesan, gouda, dried figs, apricots - heaven.\n5. Bottomless iced tea, soda, coffee, hot tea, juice.\n6. Rice porridge/ congee - not what you'd expect at this buffet but so tummy warming after a long night out!\n7. Come on there's just too many good things here, and almost everything is executed well!\n8. YOU CAN STAY A LONG TIME - I did (4+ hours), so eat to your heart's content, then take a 7+ hour nap from your food coma."
0,"We ordered food from these people and never again. They completely botched the order and did not want to fix the issue. They stated that they knew thy missed part if our order and that they had the order as something else. They stated that the manager had to be there before they do anything! They wouldn't even offer to fix what was wrong, the lady laughed at my husband during the whole issue. This company is EXTREMELY unprofessional. I have never had a business be so unwilling to fix a problem they created. We went to go return the food and get our money back. The manager have us some story about how the waitress repeated back the order twice which is a lies an a complete change of her original story. He then did not want to refund the tip stating that you can only refund the food. How in the hell can you take a tip on something you screwed up and not charging??? He then proceeded to threaten us! Really?!? He told us to never order from them or come back. Lucky I have to give you a rating otherwise I wouldn't. You have poor business practices and I would like people to know. I will not come back to your business and neither will any of my friends, family or coworkers."
0,"Went here before the ballet on Saturday...server was good, food was pretty tasty, not the best Mexican but decent enchiladas for the price--I disagree with another review that said chips are great--pretty bland, but guac was good.  They charged us $13 each for a margarita when the menu lists them as 7.50--one size--we asked the waitress who sent over the manager (bartender also) who said they were in the process of re-printing their menus and there are 2 sizes/prices... that is bait and switch...no one mentioned there were two sizes when we ordered! And 13 bucks for a house marg???-- this isn't NYC.  He didnt want to comp anything, then he said he would comp one drink each---which was fair--then when the new bill came he took 6.00 off each bill.  wtf.  I mean if you want repeat business just comp a damn overpriced drink  already, make the patron happy, and we would probably go back and give it another try.  instead, he pissed off four people who eat out all the time...we won't go back.  Oh, and they took my number and assured me the owner would be calling to discuss our dissatisfaction....rigggghhhttttt.  still waiting on that call"
0,"I'll start with 4 stars for the Bayside Buffet, located in Mandalay Bay, for the food. They kept the shrimp coming, they had some really killer steak, and the fruit was ripe and edible.\n\nHowever, they had us standing just inside their entry area for about 15 minutes while they tried to figure out if they could accommodate our group of 10, regardless of the fact that we had told them they could just split us up and put us anywhere. We could see huge expanses of tables open. No idea what the hell was going on there. By the time we had been seated, several of the guys had already gone and eaten two plates worth of breakfast.\n\nDrinks were served quickly enough, though there was some confusion as to who ordered what.\n\nPrice was reasonable for a buffet with the quality of food they had. But there is a lot of competition in this town. I seriously didn't need to be standing there that long, caffeine-less."
0,"Locker Room sucks ass\nThe locker room is WAY too small ... they have a whopping two benches that comfortably sit 4 each, so a whole 8 people fit in the entire room at any given time. The rest of the locker room is wasted by \""premium\"" lockers that virtually NO ONE uses. Then there's the very awkward positioning of chairs where people can hang out and lounge in the locker room while you are changing in front of them. And although there's signs that say \""no cell phone use\"" in the locker room, the people in those chairs usually have their phones out with backside cameras facing YOU.\n\nUndependable shower water temperatures.\nThis places has gone weeks without hot water in the showers, and it's always hit and miss. It's been over 3 months and they can't seem to get it right.\n\nMachines in various states of disrepair.\nThis place is brand new and still there are numerous machines in  various states of \""broken-ness\"". It's just amazing to me that these machines are left broken for months on end. Do they ever use their own equipment?\n\n\""Opps for got to tell you\""\nSo while getting the sales tour we were shown the tanning bed, of which the salesman just forgot to tell us that it was an extra charge. After telling management about this scam, the response was \""sorry\"".\n\nOne decent thing is that they supply razors, q-tips, antiperspirant, bodywash, cream rinse and shampoo in the locker room/showers.\n\nI wish I had gone back to the YMCA rather than get locked into a 2 year deal with this poorly managed gym. The Y does not have any long term contracts and they have a pool, racquetball courts, basketball courts (of which Gold's has none) along with two workout rooms and all cheaper and without a long contract ..."
1,Get the rock shrimp and baked crab hand rolls and some Star Rabbit sparkling blueberry sake.  The other rolls are on the small side but you can't beat the view of the fountain!
0,"Love the smoothies, but EVERY SINGLE TIME I go(doesn't matter what time) it takes about 15-20 mins. for 1 smoothie to be made. The staff move very slow and sometimes are unkind. This location is very busy and staff must meet the standards."
1,"Another place my dad and I hit while staying in Pittsburgh in May of 2012.  Came here on recommendation of a couple people who worked at the Sheraton Station where my dad and I were staying.  \n\nEveryone we talked to at the hotel about this place recommended the Delmonico steak sandwich.  They all said basically the same thing.  \""It's what a Philly cheese steak  aspires to be\"".   I'm not sure if this is just a Pittsburgh v Philly rivalry thing.  None the less, it was a good sandwich.\n\nI also had the Gazpacho soup.  That was just what the doctor ordered.  \n\nWe sat out on the patio on a warm sunny evening and enjoyed a beer and sandwich.  \n\nAs with every place I went in Pittsburgh, the people were awesome."
1,"Had a very good meal. The appetizers were both big (by french standards), but both nicely prepared - the beet salad was especially good, as was the tart with tomatoes and caramelized onions. For the mains, the pastured veal chop with buffalo mozzerella, fresh tomato and balsamic glaze was very good. The halibut was also very nice. Great room as well, although sit in the front room or outside, the back room was a little cut-off."
1,"When I heard that they were opening a Nordstrom Rack in Town and Country I was jumping for joy. :) So,  I finally went to the new Rack at Town and Country last night.  When I walked in the store I was like WOW this store is huge and well organized.  \n\nSara the cashier that checked me out was super friendly to me and we ended up talking for a couple of minutes too.  I will definitely be coming by to the Rack at Town and Country."
1,"Just go for the espresso. Get it in a latte or a mocha. I've only been here twice but each time the espresso has tasted the way espresso should taste: sweet and tangy. If you are an espresso lover like me and need to find a place to stop in Madison, do not waste your time with other places. Ignore the hipsters and get your quality coffee at JPH."
0,"We came here on our first night in Vegas, as we were staying at the Venetian.  The food was cheap (for the Strip), and the quality the same.  We got a variety of dim sum items incl. bbq pork, some noodles, and won ton soup I think.  I remember the food not being particularly fresh, and perhaps even a bit cold.  Definitely not up to par for a Bay Area palette, but why'd I come to Vegas to eat \""Chinese\"" food anyway?"
0,"My wife, 5 yr old son and I had just arrived from Phoenix to Circus Circus at 7PM and we were starving so obviously we hit the buffet. Upon arrival, I could not believe how much the price was for dinner. It was $16.99 for adults and $11.99 for kids. Total price $49 bucks!  The food was decent but like others mentioned some of the offerings seemed like they were frozen items such as the pizza. The macaroni cheese was definitely boxed but even Kraft mac and cheese looked better than here at the buffet. For the price, there could have been more selections. The salad bar looked unappealing. The desert bar was average. All in all I will never eat at the buffet strictly due to the high cost and average selections."
1,"Here's how it works: Meet at a bar. Get a wrist band and a free drink. Hang out for a little. Load up in a mini-bus with other people in your group. Drink in said mini-bus and make friends. Arrive at the first club. Skip the line, don't pay cover. Dance, drink for an hour or two, then at a particular time hosts will tell you it's time to go to the next place. Repeat for two more clubs. As the evening goes on, the different groups consolidate into fewer and fewer buses as people stay at clubs they like or just get tired and leave. By the final club, all the groups are back together again. At the end of the night, find your way home (or ride the bus to a strip club.)\n\nWhy it's good:\n1) Skip the freaking idiotic lines at three pretty darn good clubs.\n2) You get to hang out with the same group of people all evening long... and you're stuck on a freaking bus, drunk, so everyone is really social. (The two strangers who met on the bus next to me got REALLY social, if you know what I mean.)\n3) The hosts are awesome. They drank with us, had a pole dancing dance off, and were just genuinely nice.\n4) The bus was surprisingly clean and comfortable. It's nice to sit for a bit after dancing. And it felt like a party in there.\n\nWhy it's bad (and no, the bads are not that bad):\n1) Casinos are huge so there's still a bit of walking from bus drop off to the clubs.\n2) The free shots on the bus taste like cough medicine.\n3) If two bachelor parties end up on the same bus, it's a freaking sausage fest (you can switch buses later, so it only matters in the beginning.)\n4) There's a little down time when people are waiting to leave the club. Everyone's just kind of standing around."
1,Andrew came out and did a great job. He spent the entire day working on our rental property. We were expecting the worse news and he was honest and did what was needed. I will call this company for all jobs that we need! Awesome job!
0,"This is an interesting museum.  It definitely has a great variety of musical instruments from many countries, and mostly of older eras, with musical content you hear by way of headphones.\n\nIt's extremely educational, and will take most of a day to fully tour.\n\nThe downside I experienced was that a large group of school children came for a tour - which is great - but they were extremely noisy and one couldn't hear the music content on the headphones.  The museum was unusable for the 1.5-2 hours the children were present.\n\nMy advice is if you are planning to visit this museum, call ahead and see if there will be any groups like this when you may visit.  Plan your visit around them and you won't have a major distraction."
0,"We went for breakfast and it was okay, edible I suppose. Especially considering we were up all night partying. Everything we got was cold, especially the eggs. I did like they had different breakfast sauasages. We got the $32 pass to eat here and at excalibur buffet all day. Great deal even if you only going to eat there 2 times that day."
1,"Awesome Burger. I had the Buffalo! It was 17 bucks, but it was well worth it. Also ordered sweet potato fries, which were delectable.\n\nTHere's a few different burgers to choose from, but you can't go wrong. Definitely the best meal I had in Las Vegas while I was there recently. Highly Recommended."
1,"Quite delicious for brunch. I am not normally a sweet breakfast food person, however the buckwheat waffle with a mimosa seems to be a perfect combination."
1,"Coffee selection is amazing!  I just wish they had as good of a selection of parking spots. We had to resort to street parking.  Once inside, the environment is quirky and eclectic.  The space was cozy, although at times felt a tad too small.  My friends and I went to Smelly Cat to work on a project.  As soon as we arrived, we realized that this wasn't the kind of coffee house you could be productive at.  Due to the size restrictions, which hence, make the table sizes smaller, we had to enjoy our delicious coffee and relocate.  \n\nService was friendly and the atmosphere was super chill.  I'd go back for some schmooze time!"
0,"Terrible experience, with damage to my truck!  I've had car washes here, but when I brought my truck in for a full detail ($300) my truck sustained $1,800 in damage from them power washing the engine, WHICH I TOLD THEM NOT TO DO!!!  Sure, I didn't have to pay for the unfinished detail (they called me and said something was wrong) and they did reimburse for one item, but I'm still out $1,200 with absolutely no resolution or care from Danny's corporate.  The only option I'm left with is to sue.  STAY AWAY!"
1,"I don't eat seafood, so a sushi restaurant isn't usually my type of place.  I was with a group on this trip, so my food choices were over ruled by 5 others.  I entered into Blue Ribbon scared and concerned.  Scared because I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into and concerned that I would leave hungry.  I am happy to report however that not only were my worries unfounded but I actually really liked this restaurant too.\n\nLike I said, I don't eat fish... I mean none.  As a group we ordered appetizers, I only was able to try one non-seafood item, the meatballs, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good they were.  As my table ordered many sushi plates to share, I ordered my entr\u00e9e.  I chose the filet with mashed sweet potatoes, this was one of the best filets I have ever had.  The meat was cooked to a perfect medium per my request, seasoned well, and the sauce that was served on the steak was very tasty as too.  The sweet potatoes were creamy and delicious.\n\nThe server at our table was very attentive.  We never had to wait for our waters be refilled or for new drink orders to be taken.  He also provided great insight into the menu and helped the table decide what we might like.  He really knew the menu well and was very helpful.\n\n I highly recommend Blue Ribbon for both the food and service.  Who knew a non-seafood eater would love a sushi restaurant so much.  I'm looking forward to going back again anytime."
1,The red chicken enchiladas are excellent as well as the chips and salsa. I highly recommend you try the mint lime aid for your beverage. The dinning experience is casual but I highly recommend.
1,Delicious indian food you can find near the strip. Me and my husband simply love the buffet. I like having South Indian breakfast items with chicken curry .. So I took a serving of hot hot made upma with butter chicken curry  WOWW is the word !!! \nI was so so so happy with the food that ..I badly wanted to leave a great feedback on yelp.. Hence created my yelp account. Isn't it crazy.. Food @ Gandhi definitely has that impact.
1,"The service is really friendly here.  I like how it feels personal and how the staff remembers you.\n\nI don't remember ever getting much of a wait in line - either that's because their service is so quick or I just hit it right sometimes.\n\nMeat is good, and they're not stingy.  I like the condiments/toppings, especially the pickles.  Tomatoes are fresh and good, too."
0,"Like a glutton for punishment, I hit up Roland's again last night while in town for business. I tired Kaya, but the wait was 30 + minutes.\n\nHere's the big clue I keep ignoring....the restaurant is EMPTY when everywhere else is crowded. Another issue is there's poor A/C in the dining room, which kind of sucks when it's 85 degrees and humid outside. \n\nI had a grilled vegetable sandwich and clam chowder. Same as before, it was just OK.  Service was better this time though. \n\nAll in all, I preferred my to go taco salad from doba the night before to this meal. \n\nSave your money and try somewhere else. \n\nPS. Beer selection is impressive if you want to drink beers from all around the world."
0,"This review is for the shop near Ulta on Eastern. Nicely decorated, however, the service I received was poor. I went in for a quick clean up, asked that the eyebrows be left thick. Instead one was SUPER thin and almost straight while the other thick and arched!!!"
1,I bought a lot of new stuff and the ladies came in adjusted my straps and gave me their opinion in what they liked best on me. Very attentive service ;)
1,"By far one of my favorite overall dining experiences in Vegas. The food is executed with care, the staff is wArm and inviting. The wine list is solid, and the vibe of this small spot, has enough nostalgia, and swankyness to take make you feel like you truly are in a hidden gem that few know about. Don't be a moron and not try this place it's one of the best around"
1,I love paletas. I found this place through Yelp and loved what everyone said. I grew up in South Phoenix and I do remember the paleta carts rolling around. Since those aren't around I had to find an alternative. \n\nI do recommend this place however for me $3 / paleta is quite high. They used to be $1.  \n\nFYI: It's cash only.
0,"I'm going to give the Luxor 2 stars because I have alot of good memories of my stays there over the years. The Pyramid Cafe is a nice place to stop and have a bowl of soup and rest your weary dogs after walking to the Luxor from Bellagio.\n\nThe powers that be who \""upgraded\"" Luxor ruined it, plain and simple. It's a Pyramid, why in God's name would they get rid of the Eyptian motiff? It's beyond me. The new look is awful, really really bad. Knowing what they've done to Luxor and knowing how far down the strip it is from everything else that we go to Vegas for, I don't think I'll be spending any more of my time - or money - in the Luxor while in Vegas."
1,"I can't tell you just how impressed I was with Lavo.  I was pretty apprehensive going to dinner at someplace known for its club and not its restaurant.  This place exceeded my expectations!  They even have a live DJ playing music in the restaurant (not loudly, just the right volume to set the tone for a night out in Vegas).  A group of us went for my birthday.  The meal was amazing, the service was awesome, the birthday spanking by our waiter in the middle of the restaurant was unexpected.  A number of people in our party ordered steaks (which they are still raving about), my husband got their infamous meatball (it was both delicious and HUGE).  Good times, great food, cool ambiance."
1,"It's wonderful to have Mr. Gyros in the neighborhood - this area is absolutely STARVED for more places like this.  Good, fast, cheap, and way better than any of the drive-through chains!"
1,"Best Irish pub in town, hands down! Yes it is busy, if you want a fun time and some well poured Guiness this is the place. Awesome people watching! Great spirits!"
1,"This new restaurant in Fountain Hills is well worth the trip.  The best Chinese food anywhere!  The restaurant offers great atmosphere and a very pleasant, welcoming staff.  Great for groups, lunch or dinner.  The food is out of this world.  Everything is extremely fresh and our favorite place to go.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!"
0,Wow if I could give this place a big fat 0 I would. HORRIBLE. They were out of some of the bread for their sandwiches. Imagine a bakery that is out of bread. We also ordered their featured seasonal soup. Guess what? They were out of it.  Food not worth the price. Don't go.
0,"What a disappointment!  The service, food and wine selection all leave much to be desired. The only good thing I can say is the setting is very nice."
0,"Go elsewhere.  \n\nService is mediocre, at best. \n\nFood is bland. \n\nFirefly down the street is much better."
0,"THIS REVIEW IS ONLY ON THEIR FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE\nNOT ON ANY OF THE FOOD\n\nTheir frozen hot chocolate is what they are know for, but it was just mediocre.  The consistency of the drink is icy, like a blended drink, not creamy like a shake.  The flavor/ quality of chocolate tasted like maybe a ghirardellis blended drink.  Nothing too special, especially for $12.  Not only that, but the whipped cream tasted like it was from a can of reddi whip, opposed to fresh.  This drink was ok, but for 12 bucks, i expect more.  I think an appropriate price for this beverage would be more like half the price."
1,Really enjoyed the pub today for lunch. My husband and I shared a few different appetizers and everything was delicious. Little expensive but isn't everything in Vegas? Kinberley was our waitress and she was very good! We enjoyed her! Great experience I would recommend!
1,"My Husband and I took my Grandma to Ristorante Giuseppe this evening.  Since it was a weeknight after a storm there was practically no one there, which was fine by me since I already knew this place could get crowded (based on other yelp reviews).  My Husband and I shared the one of the pasta specials, which was baked ziti with all sorts of meats.  It was creamy, cheesy, meat filled goodness.  We also had a salad and garlic bread, which was also unique since it had a kick.  My Grandma had the pork parmigiana, she loved it.\n\nOverall, this is a small Mom and Pop shop and it was VERY good.  It's always nice to support great places like Ristorante Giuseppe that are family owned and have great authentic food!"
0,I would rather go to Benihana to be honest. I have been here a few times because its so convenient but has never been worth it in the end. I have eaten here and had dinner to go it always takes forever and it is not cheap I expect cheaper if theres no atmosphere or really good food would make up for it. I have not gotten sick from the sushi here but lets just say I didnt feel so hot after eating here the last time. I looooove sushi and its hard to say that I wont be back here but I'd rather drive a bit farther and skip running the risk.
0,Very first time share experience- nice place but call before you reserve!!! No pool week we stayed & no one informed pool closed whole week we would be there!! Pool was to open yesterday & still not open! Big reason we chose Scottsdale to lay by pool & relax- will think again about coming here again- we pay good honest money & deserve good honest service!!!
1,"It is such a pleasure to be a customer when the owner and staff make you feel wanted and welcome, vs wanting your money!  Each time I call to place a takeaway order and each time I visit makes me smile because I know the other person is smiling too.  The pizza itself is delicious and fresh and boasts a crust that is chewy and crisp (how is that possible?); everything tastes just as good the next day.  Prices are competitive with other pizza joints around town -- a large pizza is $19.99 and is sliced into 8 big pieces -- but you may get MORE for your money here, due to the wonderful customer service included in every order."
0,"Reviewing airports? Guess I was compelled to after being yelled at by the annoying, power tripping, airport staff lady who thought it was okay to bark at anyone trying to avoid her escalator line control on the way up to the TSA security line. For a city dependent on people dumping their money on the strip, you'd think they'd up their efforts to provide a better gateway and experience to their patrons.\n\nThen again, the airport is okay at best most of the time especially when you think about the trainwreck that JFK & LAX can be. McCarran doesn't seem that bad anymore. Talk about low standards.\n\nArriving at McCarran is usually a smooth affair, the walk to the heavily advertised, spam filled baggage claim can be pretty fast even in the narrow corridors throughout the airport. Getting a taxi or shuttle is straightforward and the airport shuttle to the car rental center is a breeze & really convenient.\n\nLeaving is bit more difficult. Crowded check in terminals with not much space to move, long TSA lines, and not enough seating at the gates which are probably too close to one another. However, these complaints are all pretty trivial since it could be far worse in my past experience."
0,"The worst experience I had for car rental ever. I have been using Budget rental many years (at different locations) and never had any problem.  \n\nI went to them with my reservation and showed it to the representative (Dustin). He asked me if I want different car and my answer was no. But he gave me upgrade ($31/day) without any notice. I did had question with final charge but he said the discount will show later (I had a BCD code). It turns out that I was charged for a luxury car. When I complained, they treated me like a liar. I will never do business with someone who never honor their customers."
0,"Warning, Do Not go here!!\nWent here with a group of friends Halloween weekend.  Our group paid the cover charge to get in, they had advertised on facebook that women are free to get in which was not true.  As soon as we paid to get in my husband was turned around two steps in the door by the bouncers to the parking lot and informed him he can't go in.  My husband went peacefully outside and asked for his money back that they took from him for a cover charge.  He was then tackled to the ground by the thug bouncers busting open his lip and giving him a sprang ankle.  He was out in the parking lot!  My husband was not hostile, and just wanted to have a good time with our friends not to be attacked by the staff for no reason!  This place doesn't care about it's customers and feels it's in their right to assault anyone they choose to pick on.  Do not support this club/restaurant... I will be telling everyone to stay far away.. My husband is a gentle man and would not cause any trouble. Also the club is loud, overpriced, crowded, dirty, and has really shitty music.."
1,"This restaurant was highly recommended by two of my friends.  Outside patio seating is nice if you like to people watch.   But did have a small of sulfur in the morning occasionally.  Not sure where it came from, but didn't ruin our breaksfast.  I ordered the corn beef hash, which was delicious.  The poached eggs on top were a little over cooked, but it was still good.  I don't like hash browns, but these were very good.  Good service.  I would highly recommend."
1,"Arrived around midnight and the front desk was ready for us, check in was quick and we were able to turn in. The room was clean, bed comfy, the desk was huge...but the bathroom was small. Breakfast in the morning was very convenient, several choices, and the coffee hit the spot."
0,"I had to go to Vegas for an entire week for an IT conference, and this was the hotel that gave a discounted rate for staying there during the conference.  I work for the government, so we are basically required to take the \""deal rate\"".  Anyway, I waited in line for about 30 minutes to even get checked in, and then the woman claimed my hotel stay was not \""paid for up front\"", and that I needed to pay for it.  I provided a copy of the receipt and authorization showing it was paid for, but she still showed in the system it wasn't.  I told her, \""How could I have a credit card authorization and a confirmation from this hotel showing it is paid for, if it hasn't been??\""  She then went to talk to a manager...and came back over 20 minutes later.  I didn't get a \""sorry\"" or \""thanks for waiting\"", she just gave me my room key without saying anything.  \n\nMy room was supposed to be non-smoking, but when I opened the door the smell of smoke was overwhelming!  The entire room smelled of smoke, including the bedding.  I realize all of Vegas is somewhat smoky since it's legal there to smoke in the casinos, but the sheets shouldn't smell like it if they wash them.  Yuck!\n\nAnyway, just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, I went to use the restroom and there were 3-4 pubic hairs stuck on the edge of the sink.  Blah!  \n\nMaybe it's time for better front desk service and a better cleaning staff.."
1,"You have never had service until you have stayed here!  First off, a Roles Royce phantom ghost to pick you up from the airport. Then no lines anywhere.  Special entrance, escorted to the room, special elevator, a butler.  Yeah, its really that good.  Unlimited Voss waters.  Mini bar, is a real bar.  Oh, then you get to the room and realize its 2 stories and could sleep 12 if need.  Room was modern, full features, perfect.  If you have some dough to throw at your room, here is the place to do it.  We stayed 1 night and wish it was 3, but we had a prior reservations at he Mandarin Oriental on the strip."
1,"Really on the 3/4 fence here.  Server, when she was to be found, was very enthusiastic and seemed genuinely excited about her job.  The problem was the execution of her role: asked three times for an ice water, waited 10-15 minutes for a beer, etc.  They were fairly busy and had only been opened three days, so maybe she was still getting acclimated, but I do get tired of making excuses for weak service, whatever the reason is.\n\nThe burger I had with bleu cheese was outstanding and the ($8) fries were very good as well.  But perhaps the biggest surprise was how tasty the naan, veggie and sea salt hummus was as an appetizer.\n\nThere were three people in our party and the tab, with tip, was $142 and included three alcoholic beverages.  Obscene-even by Strip standards-for a burger joint, but I guess I'd recommend it if you're in the area and don't want to cross the street for the equally good-and not quite as pricey-Holsteins."
0,"Good food. Average Mexican food. There were Latinos eating here on a Thur night. More than a few, always a good sign. Live one man band as we entered. Margaritas made with sweet and sour instead of real lime juice, points deducted. \n\nI had the skirt steak, my wife had the porterhouse covered in salsa verde. \nBoth were very good, although the porterhouse was overcooked a bit. My advice is to always order your steaks one level underdone when not in a real steakhouse. \n\nThe service was very friendly, attentive, and courteous throughout. \n\nThe food is good, but not REALLY GOOD. And certainly not great. I'm Hispanic, it's not that difficult to make tasty rice or beans, but Vegas strikes out once again. \n\nThis place is just a couple of blocks away, good food, but I'm good for another year."
1,"Good Samich, I got the Italian sub. If this company really wants knock it out of the park, they will drop the hot pepper spread which contains chopped celery, and carrots, i dont think that spread had any pepperz in it. They should offer a real pepper spread like you find in Samich shops on the east coast. It's a crushed cherry pepper spread, this will dial these samiches into another dimension."
0,Ghetto white trashy bar. First time here and my car was broken into.
0,"I was looking forward to a show in Vegas. We were staying at the Stratosphere so we did receive discount tickets (if I had paid full price I would have been fully ripped off). The headliner Clair SinClair....has a nice speaking voice perhaps her next gig will be to replace Vanna White on Wheel of Fortune, she is pretty but her part in the show is minimal at best. Her speaking parts left the audience wondering why she was speaking. The dancers are good and the singer is good for most of the numbers but some were hard on the ears. The band is very good, we would have rather listened to them.\n\nOne of the people in our party even fell asleep that is how good the show was. We stayed thinking it would get better, it really didn't. The first half is definitely better...so if you want to leave do so by June it is pretty much down hill from there.  \n\n The show is a run through Claire's pin up calendar.... longest year of our lives! We were eagerly awaiting Christmas but it never came. \n\nIf you want entertainment at the Stratosphere go see Frankie Moreno.... that show EVERYONE ENJOYED!"
0,"If you go on a weekend when there is a big act, they over-sell the place. It is SOOOO packed and the security guys are total dicks. We couldn't even see the stage. Were forced to just hang out outside most of the time. This place, unfortunately, is far too popular for it's size and you will be battling people for space and drinks alllll niiittteee. Go somewhere else where you can actually have fun."
1,"It had been a while since I visited one of the Clark County Public Libraries.  But when you lose your job and anything free is good, this is the place to be.\n\nI live maybe a mile away from the Enterprise branch on Las Vegas Blvd. so it's really convenient.  While it's not the largest library it has an ample selection of books, magazines, cd's, DVDs, and pretty much anything else you would need.  The library staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.  There's about 8 computers you can reserve for an hour at a time. (or more if it's not busy)\n\nThe only other library I have visited is the Rainbow branch in the northwest valley.  That one is bigger but I prefer the enterprise branch.  We all pay to have these libraries so use them!  They're great resources."
0,"I wish Las Vegas had a REAL indoor skydiving facility..  this one has a bad design and costs much more than the superior facilities in other states.\n\nYou spend $85 for 3 minutes in the air.. most of the time you will be held onto or falling onto the metal net or running into your friends if it's your first time.  Tunnels outside of Vegas usually charge between $10 and $15 a minute.\n\nThe design of the tunnel is very bad because it doesn't offer consistent airflow like most tunnels.  Most tunnels have glass around the whole thing and your friends enter through a small door when it is their turn.  The wind is very steady and even a first timer could possibly go off on their own and explore the whole 12-16 foot area and go up to 30 feet high.  \n\nThe Las Vegas tunnel has seating around the airflow so when you go too high, the air gets weaker and can land on your friends or the padded seating area.\n\nI'm an experienced tunnel flyer so I wouldn't want to pay the ridiculous amount the Vegas tunnel is asking for a bad quality flight but I think most people could go and have a good bit of fun as long as money isn't an option.\n\nI would recommend buying more than just two minutes because it will be over before you can even think!  If you decide to go as far as 10 minutes, expect to be sore the next day in muscles you didn't know you had!  :)"
1,"THIS PLACE IS FLAT OUT, POINT BLANK, NO CONTEST, the best Bobba drink house in Nevada PERIOD! i have been drinking the black tapioca balls drink since i was 16 and now im 29 and i have had hundreds everywhere. Not only is it the cheapest place in town with a regular bobba being under 2.50 but the quality of the tea and the well prepared Bobba balls are cooked perfect. I really hate when people write comments like the balls were not cooked right when they had them in a frozen drink. When you have these cooked tapioca balls in a frozen drink you jepordize their quality. I would say get their standard milk tea with bobba and you will see the quality im talking about. This place only takes cash but they are fast VERRY clean and most of all verry good!"
0,"Checking in was quick and front desk agent was professional and friendly.  It all went down hill after that.  My husband and I are locals.  We stayed here July 21st & 22nd for our anniversary.  We like doing staycations and check out different resorts that our town has to offer. Our experience at The M was one of the worst we have ever had. The property is gorgeous.  Very clean and contemporary.  The room was spacious and had a nice view of the pool and The Strip. However the walls are so thin we could hear full conversations next door. Our neighbor rolled in at 3am sounded like 2 couples sharing a room. They were so loud. Sounded like they were having a party at 3am-5am. We called security to complain.  They did nothing.  Security and phone operator was rude and sounded annoyed that we called. They try to nickle and dime you about everything because they don't charge a resort fee. You have to pay $15 per person to use the hotel gym per day. $15 per day for Internet.  TV was poor quality, it kept freezing. Toilette paper was so cheap and thin it rips each time you try to pull it. Can almost see through them. Overall staff and service was horrible.  Servers at Jayde Fusion using slang to address us. Huddling and talking about other co-workers right next to us. Service at the pool was the worst. We waited 20mins in our chairs no waitress came by. They are all hanging out in the shade by the bar. We decided to walk to bar to start a tab. Waitress stopped us to see what we wanted. so we gave her our order and credit card to start tab. We returned to our chairs. 10mins later she returned with our drinks but forget 2 things that I asked for. After getting our drinks a friend joined us. We waited another 20mins waitress has not been by. We decided to go to the bar to get her a drink. This was a Tuesday the pool was not busy. Waitresses were slow, lazy and was not friendly or personable at all. The bar staff was OK. In the afternoon we got hungry I went to the pool grill to order some snacks. I asked cashier if I could charge to my room she said I needed ID. I said Oh ok let me go to my chair and get it. I quickly returned with my ID and grill was closed. How rude. That was the final straw that made me hate this place. I will Never stay here again and I will make sure to tell everyone I know about this horrible experience.  Shitty service can not be forgiven. Sorry M Resort I was really hoping to have a nice enjoyable anniversary,  you failed at providing that.  Worst staycation ever!\n\nPros: clean and contemporary resort and nice relaxing pool\n\nCons: shitty service, shitty service, shitty service, thin walls, cheap toilet paper, uncomfortable bed, extra charge for everything"
0,"NOT WORTH IT!!!  I was very disappointed with the quality & service.  I had initially requested to have my order delivered, was given a total which did not match up, so  I called them back to say that I'd just pick up my large order instead & was given a $5+ price difference.  I asked them what their delivery fee was, they said $3.00. Hmmm!...Clue #1.  When I picked up the order, I was given another totally different price.  I went ahead & paid for it anyways, but still felt they'd cheated me.  My container had more steamed Brocolli than there was Walnut Shrimp.  That plate was $10.95.  My husband began to eat his dish (Moo Goo Gai Pan) and he said how it tasted like it was cooked with chemicals.  I tried a spoonful and confirmed it.  He ended up puking his guts out about an hour later.  I called to speak to the Manager & they acted like they didn't care about our experience.  I told him that I wasn't expecting a refund but just needed them to hear my concern.  They still didn't care.  It's no wonder why people prefer to go to Buffets."
1,"Excellent pizza and better than excellent service. Ask for Colleen. Colleen is extremely knowledgeable and very attentive. We started with an antipasto salad. Colleen was quick to explain how their antipasto is made is it is somewhat non traditional as there are no greens, peppers and olives like many antipastos have. It was plain, but elegant. We ordered pizza for our dinner with half pepperoni and half sausage. It is their own and made fresh daily as is the pizza sauce and dough.  Definitely a keeper and a great place to take out of town guests for a casual dinner."
0,"Just like Las Vegas, it seems, you either love this place or you hate it. First off I should say, that no one from the hotel met me at the airport, carried me on their shoulders, paid me to upgrade to the penthouse suite and other such nonsense that other reviewers have claimed. I am not saying they are lying but... \nI decided to pay the premium room rate just to see how nice it could be during an overnight in Las Vegas. That was mistake number one. Satisfaction with this hotel seems to be directly related to the room rate. Had I paid $79 a night, I would honestly feel differently about the quality of my stay. What a disappointment our stay turned out to be! \nFirst the good stuff. As everyone mentions the rooms are stylish, high tech and we had an amazing view. The view was great -- if not exactly as depicted online. All the high tech stuff worked, which I was grateful for after reading other reviews, but by then I was too tired to mess with all the gadgets. We were able to hook up the iPod and listen to music. I liked that we could hook up our iPods to the sound system and the bed was unbelievably comfortable. The bathroom was nice. I imagine the SkySuites are fabulous. \nI wish I had better things to say about our stay. When we arrived around 10 pm on a Friday night there were long lines to check in. It goes very slowly. Some people were already drinking in line. I imagine at 9 am or whatever strange hour other people check in, that doesn't happen. Or on a Wednesday if there's not a convention in town or the hotel's occupancy is at 20 percent. If you arrive when there are no lines, it will go faster. \nThey must get lots of complaints, so I wouldn't like the desk clerk's job either. It shows in their attitudes. The guest ahead of me had an issue that took 45 minutes to resolve. They could have taken him aside to deal with his complaint? I (and the guests behind me) would have appreciated it. There was no organization; some lines moved faster and unfortunately I was in one that did not. An officious looking woman in uniform finally came over and shyly told us to not congregate but to make sure we were in line. Thanks. Now the issue required several trips to a non-smiling manager, lots of shaking his head. Again, I would've appreciated it if the manager would have come over, dealt with the guy and made the line move faster! Very quickly I was becoming unimpressed with the Aria. \n\nApparently, rooms with two queen beds are limited in number. If one King bed presents a problem stay elsewhere. If one King was what you reserved, you'll be content. When I finally made it to the desk clerk, I got a half hearted greeting, and when I asked what that was all about (as in you are aware I've been waiting now 45 minutes for him to finish) she quickly replied \""sorry he wanted to change his room.\"" I understood why. I had made my reservation months prior online and she tells me that they are booked and can't give me the Deluxe room I reserved and paid for but one on a much lower \""smoking optional\"" floor. What does smoking optional really mean anyway? It means it's a smoking floor. Come on folks, that's insulting enough. Of course if you're a smoker, it's not an issue. Shame shame shame. \nShe'd take $50 off the room rate. Not just no but come on you must be kidding no. I could have and would have stayed at the Palazzo, the Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, Planet Hollywood or any other hotel on the Strip for that price or less. It's pretty obvious what I'll do next time. So discussions with another \""manager.\"" Instead of two beds we can get a \""deluxe room\"" with a King. I had wasted already an hour of what was a brief visit to Las Vegas. \nThe staff did nothing to make up for all the inconvenience and changes. I asked for a late check out and was told no. Okay I can't really complain about that. But then housekeeping knocked on our door at 9 am. Yes it was my fault I did not set the \""privacy\"" switch! I can't blame the hotel staff for not knocking because either the room was vacant or we didn't want to be disturbed. I don't know who wants housekeeping in Las Vegas at 9 am! It reminded me of a terrible Holiday Inn in Texas where the leather-faced manager tried to force us out of our room before check-out time! \n\n\n\nCheck out was efficient since not a lot of people were checking out and I got a robot-like \""sorry\"" when I said our stay was disappointing. When I heard that they get a lot of complaints and unhappy guests it was easy to see why."
0,"We are frequent diners and appreciate a good experience where ever we go. We were really looking forward to a great steak dinner and prepared to drive from south Chandler and pay the high price for a great steak. It was my sister in laws birthday after all! Then to find out they were one of the restaurants participating in Restaurant Week was even better! We could get a great dinner with salad and dessert included for only $40! \n\nWhen we approached the restaurant we were greeted by a young lady. Not to sound snobby but she was wearing a casual dress with tennis shoes! Yea, tennies! We had reservations (which appeared were not necessary, because they were not busy) and were sat right away. \n\nAfter we reviewed their every day menu and the Restaurant Week menu we asked what the difference is with the $40 filet on the every day menu versus the filet on the Restaurant menu that comes with salad, sides and dessert. He responded, 8oz compared to 12oz, other than that, nothing. So easy decision, no way can I eat 12oz of steak anyway. I ordered med-rare+, it came rare. My sister in laws filet looked like road kill and also undercooked. So they had to be taken back to the cook. My husband 12oz sirloin was more like 4oz. Smashed potatoes were bland and the broccoli undercooked. The desserts were so small I finished it in two bites. I guess they were conservative since they were only getting $40 from each of us. We ordered two bottles of wine which we were over charged so our bill needed to be adjusted. The service was not at all what you would expect from a restaurant to charges an average of $50 a steak and everything else is al la cart and who has an over $2100 bottle of wine on their wine menu. And when we asked to substitute mashed potatoes for a backed potatoes we denied!\n\nIf steaks are your specialty and you honestly feel you can justify your prices then your service should match it. If you cook steaks all day long one would think you would get it right the first time and not have to be returned to the cook. \n\nNeedless to say, we will not be returning nor referring our friends. Too bad."

0,"I always feel kind of bad giving a one or two star review. I did like Sushi Factory's sushi, but there was something about the place that I can't exactly put my finger on that just will not let me give it over a two star rating. Okay, let's go with 2.5. \n\nWhen I arrived I was greeted by a very friendly hostess and seated quickly. Can I comment on the decor? I don't know, just looked a little ram-shackle to me. Ok ok... I'm not trying to be nit-picky, after all I do eat at plenty \""dumpy\"" kind of joints because their food is AWESOME. But somehow dumpy + place that is serving me raw fish = me weirded out a bit.\n\nI did the AYCE with my date. He was all hype about liking sushi though, he wouldn't even touch the sashimi I ordered, but instead insisted on all the fried little concoctions. One of our rolls completely fell apart when we tried eating it. Date didn't seem to care, but I was a little peeved.\n\nThank goodness they brought me out sake to begin with. I think this soothed the bad experience. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a decent little place, I just don't think I'll be going back considering there are much better places in the valley to get AYCE sushi."
0,"Overpriced garbage. I rarely found anything worth buying and when I did I laughed out loud at the high prices. Once my son found a little toy on the floor (unpriced) and the rude clerk announced she would be charging me $1.49 for it as it came from the loose toys which are charged 10 for 1.49. Then she had the audacity to ask me to donate my change. I told her considering she just overcharged me for a piece of junk that I could have gotten at a yard sale for a dime that she'd gotten enough money out of me. She actually looked a little sheepish. At any rate, if you are looking for a bargain, don't bother. The selection sucks, the prices are high, and I'd say half the employees hate their job. The new Goodwill in Buckeye beats this place to oblivion."
1,"I have to like this place.. this is where my engagement ring was bought.. well, it was put together.. because the story Im told by my very creative fiance, is that he wanted a particular princess cut diamond with high clarity..+VS or above... and a particular setting with channel diamonds.. My ring was given in the dark of the night.. :-) AND it was huge on my finger.. Jared has an onsite inspector who could tell me if bringing my ring down 2 , almost 3 sizes would mess up the diamonds in the sides.. \nMy one downside.. appraisers are not onsite and only there certain times of the month.. OH make that a two downsides..I was to pick up my engagement ring after the sizing at a particular time.. I called to see if I could get it 40 minutes earlier..Just being impatient and antsy and had to get to Scottsdale.. NO call back.. Even though the receptionist said it should be ready and theyd call back.. Most annoying thing is when someone says they are going to return a call.. and they blow it off.. \nAll and all .. I love Jared:-)"
1,"Best BBQ in town!  Black Dog is revitalizing downtown Urbana.  The food is great, the staff is great, and the draft line variety keep you coming back for more.\n\nNo reservations, but well worth the wait!"
1,"Wow!  I just had the best massage ever! We were able to make an appt. for 3 massages on the same day.  If you get a facial or massage there, you can use their facility all day from 5:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.  It includes the co-ed pool, sauna, steam room, hot-stone room, Himalayan salt room and jacuzzi. The salt room had REALLY loud music though, which I wasn't really expecting in such a relaxing environment.\n\nI had the specialty massage by Kara and she was great!  The pressure was perfect and they customize it to your needs.  The facility is really clean and they have a lot of amenities for you while you're there.  Everyone from the front desk to the people picking up the towels are extremely friendly and they always have a smile on their face.  I will definitely go back the next time I'm in Vegas!"
0,Sorry volcano your staff is very nice and polite but your buffet sucks I love seaweed salad but yours had a funky taste every dish I had that should have been warm to hot was cold.I went back for a second helping but every thing I choose was so mediocre I left almost a whole plate of food and left.
1,"We had walked by this place many times and had even gone into the store side (attached to the restaurant) to get some hummus, but had never gone into the restaurant. Finally went for lunch today with friends and was really happy we did. Attentive, quick service, super yummy food. Had the falafel which wasn't dried out, in the pita boat, which is just their pita sandwich..it was pretty gigantic. Friend had a gyro combo, which she was pleased with. And their baklava is to die for..some of the best I've ever had. I think their pita is homemade too..stretchy and fresh. It's not the prettiest place, but for cheap, authentic Middle Eastern food you really can't go wrong."
1,This review is just for the room an pool.\n\nWe had a cabana at the pool.  The cabana was nice and the pool was not over packed. The waitress was pretty crappy.  She seemed annoyed when we asked for stuff.  She was really slow too. I can't blame it all on her because she was the only waitress out there for a long time. \n\nThe hotel rooms were nice.  We got 2 queen beds in each room. I can tell you that the beds were not queen.  The blinds were awesome. They kept the room pitch black so we could sleep in. \n\nWe had a newspaper outside our door on Sunday. I enjoyed our stay here. I would have given  stars but the waitress at the pool made all of us mad.
0,"Ouch, this place has gone downhill like the rest of The Venetian. Came here years ago and this place was NICE! Now it feels neglected. \n\n1) They use to have bottled water. Now it's a dirty drinking fountain with a clogged filter. Water comes out at a very very slow trickle. Makes you wonder if they ever changed the filter.\n2) AC turned way too low. I was sweating to death in the joint\n3) Bathroom was not property maintained\n\nThis place is ruining the Canyon Ranch name."
1,"A great show for 2000 people.  A very High Energy show, with way more action than you can take in.  Great Beatles music.  DO NOT TRY AND SNEEK PHOTOS or you will be hounded to delete them.   My only complaint is a desire for a program with a bit of story line and cast member backgrounds and LESS adds for other things in Vegus.  Box Office at the Mirage SUCKED for picking up tickets for the event.  Crowd Mgt was good.  I would try and buy seats in 2nd or 3rd tier and NOT up close to enjoy full show."
0,"After finding an offer on one stop for First Food and Bar, I purchased the certificate and had high expectations dining here. We arrived at the Palazzo for lunch because on one stop, it showed that lunch would be available; however, on a Thursday, the kitchen was closed. So buyer beware! Check the hours of the establishment always. I decided to use Open Table to create a reservation for Friday, 5P dining for 3 (2 adults and a 17 mo old) to ensure the kitchen would be open. Upon arrival at First Food and Bar, we were greeted and seated wth menus. The decor offered a cool hipster vibe and I felt like my expectations were going to be met. Our waiter took our drink order and after 2 false starts for beer because the keg needing \""tapping\"", he finally brought a soda and beer to the table. After showing the one stop restaurant.com certificate, the waiter took it to the back and came back with our appetizer of soft pretzel sticks. Our meal was so-so. The KFC Pork Chop was cooked to discombobulating medium rare. After watching various cooking shows where this is acceptable, I decided to keep the chop at the table. The medium cooked part of the chop was tasty. The frosted flake crust offered a nice crunch. The grilled peach that accompanied the chop was overdone and not sweet. If the plate had been executed better - medium cooked chop and a sweet grilled peach to go with the cream, then this would have been a fine dish. The Lamb Osso Bucco was a big portion. The lamb was tender and the eggplant couscous was very flavorful and spicy. A bit more raita would have been great to bring this dish home. The childrens menu is de riguer and the chicken nuggets and fries were pretty good. Overall the meal was fine. But the service was not. The waiter dropped off the check which was $95. Typically, with restaurant.com certificated the servers ALWAYS go over the bill and show how the discount was applied and to ensure the customer sees the gratuity that was added. This time no. My husband dropped $120 on the bill and the waited asked if we needed change and my husband said No. Then, the waiter never came back. No follow up on the receipt of the meal, no follow up on drink refills or additional drinks...nothing, except another guy looking at the table waiting for our departure to bus. So we left. About 50 feet outside of the restaurant, the restaurant.com issue stuck with me and I went back inside to ask the waiter if he applied the $25 off. He simply said Yes. No show on the reciept...nothing. In effect, this guy made off with an 18% gratuity automatically applied because of the restaurant.com with an additional 26% gratuity from my husband -- and no, he did not provide 44% in gratuity level of service. Lastly, open table contacted me to advise that I was a NO SHOW on the reservation. Very troubling that even the hostess couldn&apos;t confirm an open table reservation. Thereby, erasing the whole dining incident from the records -- no reservation confirmation and no credit card swipe on the bill."
0,"Unless it's an artist performing, I'll be sure to skip Hakkasan.\nNothing here impressed me. Not the crowd. Not the music. Not the DJ. Sure, each individual song was nice on the night of 10/17. But the transition between songs was sh*t.\n\nThe alcohol is ridiculously expensive. And if I come back, I will be sure to get a table.\n\nXS, you have a lifer here..."
1,"Not bad. Staff was nice. Had a chicken quesadilla from the hotel restaurant, and there was only 5 minutes until closing at 11:00. The gal was cool, and very accommodating. I appreciate that."
1,Awesome service - lightning fast! Took less than 15 minutes to get my cracked iPhone screen fixed and under $100. Will definitely stick to these guys for any repairs! Ask for Carl :)
1,I had a friend pick up some #1 combo sandwiches and it was crispy delicious and just enough sauce. Bread was fresh and really crisp.  They called in the order and sandwiches were good to go. I think it is yummier than some of the lees in la.
1,"I picked up an egg, cheese, and potato breakfast burrito to eat during my flight.  I had it for about two hours and it kept really well!  It would be extremely easy to slap this combination together for a tasteless boring burrito.  I'm happy to report that it was not at all.  I definitely recommend getting the salsa they offer when you pick up your order.  \n\nIf you want a meal to carry on that keeps well, this is a great choice.  Staff were very friendly as well."
1,I love this store for quick visits to stock up on some things I need like produce.  I don't like to shop here for all of my grocery needs though.  Their prices are fair and they have a good selection of meats and produce.  They also have alot of ready to cook meals which are great for if you are in a hurry.  I just wish that they were a little healthier.
1,"The food, environment, and overall service was great. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The place could be a little cleaner which is why only 4 stars."
0,"This was my second time for eating at the Jade Palace.  My first time was awesome!  Food was excellent and the service superb!  So I decided to bring my sister n law with me the second time.  A big mistake!!  Food was still excellent but the service was one of the worst I have ever had!  The waitress must have been new.  She brought out the wrong food and mixed our orders.  They finally got mine right but had to re do my sister n laws entire order!  I was very upset and embarrassed to say the least!  She never came back for re fills on our drinks, in fact she disappeared!  Another waitress had to deal with our unfortunate service!  It took the original waitress 45 minutes to bring our bill out!  The other waitresses were looking for her!  We thought maybe she walked out and quit.  Finally, someone came and took our bill up so we could check out.  I will think twice about coming back here and if I see that waitress still working there I will walk out!!  The first time is a 5 Star Rating but the second time and the reason I am writing this so management can read I give it a poor rating!  Don't know if she was not trained, did not pay attention during training or just totally a poor uncaring waitress!!  :("
1,"Try the Charred Fillet.  Moist and tender inside.  Excellent.  For 2 people without drinks or appetizers it was about $100. My fianc\u00e9e had the Prime Rib and we shared a dessert.  \n\nI rarely review on a one time visit, but we will be back.. and the stars on this review is subject to change."
0,"Two issues: (1) bugs in the room, and (2) inconsistent service.  The first person I spoke with about the bug issue said there was nothing that she could do.  In fixing the bug issue, the manager emphasized how important customer service was to him and that was the reason he offered me a room that had recently been sprayed for bugs.  The second problem is minor: I asked for a drink that I forgot to grab until I was finishing my breakfast.  The guy was literally locking the fridge when I realized I had nothing to drink.  He refused to unlock it because it was exactly 9:30am - company policy.  The guy seemed angry that I asked; I was surprised he said no.  Although I knew I could ask the manager - and he would just give me a drink - it was just too minor a request to seek out a manager.\n\nA place does not have good customer service if only a manager can make a decision.  The staff has to be empowered to fix problems and directed to give good customer service."
1,"Two years ago I bought a water softener and filtration system from AHW.  They carry good products at reasonable prices.  I really like the service they provide.  Easy to get appointments, quick response time, professional technicians, always very helpful.  They call to remind me when my filter needs changing.  This year Gerardo changed my water filter.  He was very prompt, thorough and professional like everyone I've dealt with at AHW.  Highly recommend this company if you need prompt, reliable, affordable service."
0,"i don't know what the hoopla was all about to honest.  the service was good for the amount of people in line, but the food was just eh.  i got kali mist which sounded awesome.  bacon, turkey, avocado, pepper jack, veggies, chipotle mayo?  sign me up!\n\ni started eating and was disappointed.  onions galore and lettuce to spare....but one, yes only one piece of bacon.  that's a tragedy right there.  i could barely find the cheese...trust me, i looked.  the ingredients that matter (and cost a bit more) were sparse while the ingredients that are cheap were in abundance.  \n\ni will stick to my own sandwiches at home.  i can't justify spending $10 for a big ole hunk of bread stuffed with veggies but lacking in the good stuff :/  i was bumming hard about the bacon and still am sad!"
0,"The zoo is really really tiny. So, if you're expecting a larger zoo, you're out of luck and will have to go to a big city, such as Chicago or Washington D.C.. Also, parking is Very limited so you'll have to park on a street somewhere if you can find a spot. The zoo shares its space with a recreation park so you're also competing for parking spaces with people going there as well.\n\nI was really disappointed when I found many exhibits closed, and there were no capybaras out (my favorite animal) if you happen to be in Madison, make this a stop, it's free; but don't make a special trip for it if you're not close."
1,"I got a massage/facial package as a gift and it was absolutely the best massage I've ever gotten.  I upgraded from a Swedish to a deep tissue, which was performed by Theresa.  She focused on my problem areas, was friendly, and the best masseuse ever.  I can't emphasize how awesome she was!  I felt like a new woman after my massage.  Then I had a great facial with Tina!  Both nice ladies and made my experience at GVR Spa just spectacular!!"
0,"Terrible service!!!\n\nThe guy that made my sub looked really unhappy and annoyed. He disgustingly threw the meat and cheese to the side after putting some on the sub. In the meantime the cashier lady got in an argument with a customer. Instead of backing off when the customer started walking away she decided to talk back with attitude. The customer then got ticked off and started arguing again! Then!! The cashier lady walked from behind the counter to the customer area and pointed to the arguing customer and said 'let's take this outside'. I could not believe this was happening. Needless to say, their staff is very unhappy and don't understand the concept of 'service industry'. I will never go back. No thanks!"
0,"I'd give zero if I could. I stopped by today with my wheelchair-bound wife. I asked if I could look inside (trying to see if we could get around with her chair). The bouncer put up his arm and WOULDN'T LET ME LOOK INSIDE.\n\nNot only will I never go here, I hope they go broke."
0,"I was visting my friend in Phoniex, so we went to The Mint.  The line didn't seem very long but it seemed to move extremely slowly.  When I asked the bouncer how long the wait was he said it was hard to say because they were letting in the people with reserved tables first.  Since I hate waiting in line I asked how much a table was and he said they were sold out.  When we got in the place didn't seem very packed.  The place looked pretty, but the dance floor seemed small and broken up with reserved booths.  We ordered chilled shots and wow were they watered down.  The next round we ordered them unchilled and they were stronger.  As far as the music went I would describe it as gay club music without any Lady Gaga or Britney, and without any mixing.  I didn't think it was a gay club...but i could have been wrong?  My friend commented none of the guys were good looking. I responded I see some pretty ones but they are gay!"
1,"This golf course was pretty nice. While it was a bit more difficult because there is a lot of desert and less grass areas, it was still a great experience.\n\nOn-Time for Tee Time: They kept us on the schedule for our Tee off. They didn't have us go early, like I have experienced at other courses. Other courses that start doing that and end up 30+ minutes ahead and then others miss their scheduled tee time, when they are actually on time. Not here. They stuck to the schedule.\n\nPace: The pace was great. There was not the tight management as I have experienced at other courses. We did have a guy come and ask if the pace was ok for us, and we were fine. I didn't feel stressed about keeping up and we didn't really wait all that long by the time we got to the next hole. Other reviews may say the pace was too slow. That is their preference, but I wouldn't mark it down because of that. If you want a faster pace, go to another course that runs it that way.\n\nIt was a great relaxing time of golf, even though my game that day was horrible. :)  Of course, it is always horrible. I need to take some lessons. Hahaha.\n\nLayout: It is a bit dangerous with the layout on some of these holes. One of our guys was nearly hit by a ball within 3 feet. Yikes!  -- It wouldn't have been so bad, but no one yelled out \""Four!\"" -- That is not the fault of the course, that is the fault of the golfer not being responsible.\n\nIncluded lunch: This was great. The sandwich was full of meat for me. My friend ordered the tuna sandwich and it was packed with tuna. Great lunch after a great game.\n\nI would have given this course a 5, but with the dangerous layout of some of these holes, I had to mark it down."
1,"We booked this hotel with some hesitation but I have to say I was thoroughly impressed. It feels like a mini venetian, and since it's connected to the other large casino hotel (name currently escapes me, Mandalay? ) it has all the amenities you would want in Vegas. Highly recommend!"
1,"Be Happy at Be Yoga!\n\nI've been to several studios in Charlotte, and I'm always impressed with Be Yoga. They offer regular specials to entice new & returning students. They offer a variety of classes to appeal to new & experienced yogis. \n\nChristine's classes are among my favorite in town! The front staff has gone out of their way to know me by name, even though i don't get to practice there as much as I'd like to, since I live in S CLT. They also offer a great assortment of clothes, yoga accessories & cool EcoCuffs.\n\nThey've made some great improvements with the recent management & name change. Showers will be a great (future?) addition for morning & lunchtime yogis who need to get cleaned up for work."
1,My hubby and I got take out and everything was delicious! They also had it ready To go once we got there which was nice. Well done and way to redeem yourselves from the last visit!
1,"I found this place through Yelp and I'm glad I did. It's on the small side and it's super busy but service is quick and the food is good. They really have a variety of things to order from breakfast stuff to quesadillas, to burgers and pitas. For me I gotta have the jalapeno burger which is always cooked perfect. It's hard to find a place that doesn't over cook their burger meat."
0,"This is one of those in-between ratings. It's better than \""Meh. I've experienced better\"" and worse than \""a-OK\""\n\nIt's a convenient location for me, and it's easy one-stop shopping for oil changes and car washes. They also have a nice punch card system.\n\nBut you have to be INCREDIBLY careful here. Their whole game is the upsale. They aren't making money of $25 oil changes and $5 car washes. Their entire goal is to find something wrong with your car and charge you bloated prices for the repair. \n\nFor example, your transmission fluid may be fine. They will tell you need a transmission flush. They will notice a wiper blade that might be cracked, and they will charge you double the price of what you can get a blade for across the street at Autozone. I know enough about cars to not get sucked in, but I'm sure others have fallen  victim to this.\n\nAnd while we're on the subject ... it's really wrong the way repair shops play this game. They have really given their industry a horrible name by preying on people's fear of breaking down on the side of the road to upsale repairs that are often unnecessary.  Sorry for the rant, but I thought it was relevant here."
0,"WORSE customer service EVER! My boyfriend and I were even staring at the girl working there wondering at which point she would smile. Everyone was just rude and the pizza was absolutely terrible. It was slimy because of the grease and the dough was undercooked. Seriously, don't waste your money."
1,Awesome place. Except the ID guy needs to learns manners and/or customer service skills.
0,"I was there during the 4th of July weekend,  worst buffet In Las Vegas,  $40.00/pp, drinks are extra."
1,"I went back to  Urban Cookies after a not so hot visit in July if thats even possible.  Anyway, my daughter and I were yearning for a sweet bite and were unusually in the neighborhood so we stopped by.  My daughter got the chocolate cupcake and devoured it within seconds, liked it, but said \""you know I love chocolate but this is too much chocolate\""  so if you like too much chocolate this cupcake is for you.  I on the other hand tried the featured cupcake that was in an orange shell.  I took it home for later that evening.  Well when later came I was in anticipatory mode, hoping beyond hope that this would be the experience I desired from eating way too many calories.  It was AWESOME and I savored every delectable bite!  The name should be changed to Urban Cupcakes which are way better than the cookies in my opinion.  So I will definitely drop by again when in the area and need a cupcake fix.  A Congratulation on the Cupcake Wars win is definitely in order!!!"
1,"This place is THE ULTIMATE place for cigars in Vegas!  Paul & Sarah are unbelievably knowledgable and nice.  They and their shop are the BEST!  If you're looking for quality cigars, some of which are homemade blends created by the owners... then this is your place."
1,"I've been here a couple times with my husband, and we really enjoyed it. It has an excellent location right off of East Blvd in Dilworth. The hot dogs are very good, and the menu has a lot of toppings to choose from. For my taste, these are the best hot dogs in Charlotte. We both had the Chili Cheese Coney and the dog itself has a lot more flavor than the typical dog. They grill it right there and the chili and cheese are very well balanced. The onion rings are terrific. I only wish they had healthy side options like a salad or a cup of fruit."
1,"The sister property of the Venetian, the Palazzo is one of our favorite places to go when we decide to go to the Strip.  Here's why:\n\n- We enjoy the food & beverage options here.  LAVO, Dos Caminos, and Double Helix are a few of our favorites.\n\n- Easy access to the self parking garage.  It's located just off Twain Ave, which is off the Strip.  It makes it easy for us locals to get in/out of the property.  We prefer to park here than at the Venetian.  We often park here and walk to the Venetian.\n\n- FREE Wifi on the casino floor.  Yes, you can connect on the casino floor for FREE!  This is very beneficial when there's a convention or meeting at the property and you need internet access.\n\n- The rooms here are spectacular and can be found for reasonable rates in this down economy.\n\nWill I return?  You bet."
0,"The plumber came out to install a water softener. He charged me $59 for a quote and price was nearly $500. He spent at most 10 minutes looking around, nothing was itemized on his quote and he was surly. I had used Lange for an earlier project thinking they had good service but no way...THEY WERE AWFUL. I gave all the details about my unit to the plumber but either they didn't write it down or didn't care. I also wanted a quote on them installing an under-mount sink in the kitchen only to have them tell me (ONCE THEY ARRIVED), that they don't install under-mount sinks. When you find a good service provider in Vegas you stick with them...LANGE PLUMBING is NOT a good service provider. When I called their office, the response I got was...\""Sorry\"". I may as well have taken $59 and burned it in the back yard. I got ZERO value! Lange Plumbing apparently makes it's money by ripping people off for $59 fees. I will never use them again and I will try to convince as many people as possible to never use their service."
0,"Absolutely appalling customer service. I waited almost a half as hour to exchange a tool and EVERY one they had in stock was also broken. Complete garbage. The staff seems completely uninterested in long wait and lines. I watched other customers stand and wait equally long for tools from the back warehouse. If you go, don't be in a hurry and fully expect to return half of what you buy."
0,Just a busy fast food area. Nothing special really unless your looking for some grease and fat for the arteries. Just ducked in to buy some coffee which was not that good anyways. Just needed the caffeen to boost moral! Otherwise I hardly go in here unless I have to use the bathroom which cost 30P or so btw so make sure you have change on hand. Other then that really there isnt much to say about here. Gave the 2-star cause the place was clean and so are the loos.
1,"When I want to go out but not spend $100 on entertainment and also get some exercise in at the same time and see some beautiful Arizona landscape, the Desert Botanical Gardens is the best place I can go. I enjoy walking around the Garden looking at all of the flowers in bloom and all of the different kinds of cactus. I also enjoy when they have different exhibits that you can see as you are wandering the garden. I really enjoyed the Chihuly Glass artwork that was displayed a few years back. \n\nProbably my favorite time of the year to come here is when they have the butterflies. They are so pretty and this year there were so many of them! We went this last weekend on my day off and the weather was perfect and we just had a great time. I also get to brush up on my photography skills here the best because I can take some amazing pictures of flowers and butterflies. \n\nIf you want to see what the Arizona desert is all about, you need to come here to experience it first hand. Its not only about dirt and cacti. There are flowers galore as well."
1,"Chose this hotel because of price and they take pets. Although furnishings showed wear, cleaner than I expected.  (Never stayed in a pet friendly hotel before). Really appreciated that the room was well insulated against sound. We were right next to elevator and it did not disturb, nor was there excessive noise from hallway ( doors slamming, people walking, talking, etc).  One complaint is that we were on 2nd floor and room opened to inside corridor. Inconvenient when our dog needed to go outside. Other than that, was very good. Good value for price."
0,"one of the worst hotel experiences i have ever had in my life.  it took us nearly and hour to check in and there was not any line. i had a two bedroom suite at the hotel and when we finally got to our room it was disgusting. there were empty bottles everywhere the beds were dirty and there was \""stuff\"" in the toilet.  \nwe called down and were told to come back to the lobby for another room.  waited for 30 min to be told there were no more rooms like ours and it would take 3 hours to clean!!  we would need to take two rooms that were not suites. no vouchers, no food and beverage; just here is what we have take it or leave it.\n\nthis hotel has missed the old Vegas tradition of respect and accommodating your guest to whatever end.  I would strongly urge anyone who reads this to find a room somewhere else"
1,i love the pub too. i'm a minute's walk away... in... what was that? not exactly the best neighborhood??????????????\nthere is none better.
1,"Love the food, love the special sauce.  Lobby is always super nice as is the rest of the staff."
0,"The BEST part about this place was this BEAUTIFUL male go-go dancer. He was probably the best looking, best dancing, dancer, I have EVER seen in my life. Too bad he was gay. Too bad for me, that is. The music sucked, until about 3 AM.. It got better after that. Damn, by then, I'm too fucking tired though! \nThey did have some cool acrobatics up above.. kinda Cirque Du Soleil-esque.. kinda cool.. WHY CAN'T ANY OF THESE GOD FORSAKEN CLUBS PLAY DECENT MUSIC?? Even consistent Top 40 would have been ok, but NOOOOOOOO... what is UP WITH THIS Rock N' Roll/Trance mixing shit?? Jebus.. It's unbearable..\nOh, they had lockers. That was cool, cuz we had like 5 jackets.. haha..\nThe dudes were pretty much all barf too. Except one, but he liked my girl.. too bad for him, cuz she had a man.. HAHA..\nOh well... I still managed to get my dance on and ROCKED it to Holla Back Girl.. HAHAHA.."
1,"For our 13th anniversary, my wife and I decided to try this relatively new Northern Italian restaurant in Charlotte's Eastover neighborhood. The meal was terrific, particularly the fried Risotto Balls that started things off, and the INCREDIBLE Gnocchi that followed. Both paired perfectly with a wonderful bottle of Barolo from their extensive selection of Italian wines.\n\nI was a bit disappointed, though, with the Grouper we ordered for our main course. It came highly recommended by our server, but I found it to be a bit dry and lacking in flavor. I would not order it again. For dessert, we shared a fantastic plate of zeppoli, along with a pair of cannolis that were decent, but unfortunately underwhelming. For the price, I expected more.\n\nI wanted to like this restaurant more than I did, but considering they've only been open a few months, I'm hopeful the menu selections will improve by our next visit. There are better restaurants in Charlotte for the money, but Stagioni is a welcome addition to the local dining scene, and one that I hope will be around for many years to come!"
1,"I have to say as far as chain restaurants go I've been pretty happy w Chili's.  I go for lunch at least once a week and have never had a problem with bad service.  \n\nI also LOVE that they don't allow children in the bar area, and don't allow smoking either.\n\nThe menu is typical American fare and the prices are decent.\n\nAll in all, can't complain."
0,"Awful! The worst meal I have had at a restaurant. I came for the Sheppard's pie, but they don't serve it in the summer time. I had the cast iron chicken. The chicken was fine, but the stuffing was unbelievably SALTY. They give you  two green beans and a piece of broccoli as the vegetable. I tried my son's short ribs and they were very salty also. The waiter was very courteous and professional. They have these little water glasses and an employee who is constantly hovering over your table trying to keep the glasses filled. We arrived there at 5:30 p.m. There was a room full of empty tables, but the hostess made a big deal out of us not having reservations. We ended up in a corner at a small table for four, although there was five of us. By the time we left, there was still a room full of empty tables! If you know someone with high blood pressure and you want to kill them, bring them here. The salt content in the meals is ridiculous."
1,"This place is a hidden gem!\n\nPlease don't let the surrounding area deter you from this fine establishment! \n\nStaff: unbelievably friendly from beginning to end! Hector, our waiter, was patient throughout the many questions we had and even have us a complimentary ceviche dish to start! \n\nFood: O.M.G! In order of our favorites:\n1) molcajete. GET THIS!!! It is basically a volcano of saucy lava that is erupting with steak, chicken, shrimp, and fish. It is served with rice, beans, and tortillas and is made for two or three people to share. It is made in either a green tomatillo (mild) sauce or a red diablo (spicy) sauce. I liked the diablo more bc it had such amazing flavor. \n2) guacamole: best ive ever had!!\n3) Shrimp in cream sauce: yummmm. Great flavor!\n4) Shrimp and octopus in garlic sauce - also good\n5) shrimp tacos - just okay. Would choose the above over these\n\nFinally, don't forget to check in on yelp!! Show your waiter and you get a big free slice of cake!!"
1,Would get five stars but the some of the staff aren't the brightest. They have messed up my order twice out of the 4 times I've been here. There sandwiches are great though and it's like a little Asian market inside. Only able to do card transactions if spending ten dollars or more which sucks. Other than that everything else is good will not be going to subway anymore.
0,"Well, it's a Starbucks...  Same coffee, same general atmosphere, but that is all that's good about this location.  It is about a third the size it needs to be, there is ALWAYS a waiting line and tables are overcrowded and sometimes hard to find.  Forget meeting with any privacy at all.  I felt like I was in the middle of three other conversations!\n\nI DO NOT recommend this location!"
0,"Was a great place to eat, now food is greasy, and it doesn't taste like it used to. Used to have a more of a homemade taste, now tastes like Costco business center. Sad. I loved going here."
1,"I had my car washed at Clean Car Express in May. This place  is AWESOME - having a better and longer car wash garage then typical ones. My vehicle had been transported from California to Pennsylvania and covered by dust or stain that was hard to completely remove in a regular car wash store. But my car was cleaned within just one cycle in Clean Car Express! And the price is reasonable for the result at that time. Back in California (and basically anywhere else), it is difficult for me to find a car washing store with such impressive equipment and service. The exterior of the garage is also of a beautiful cartoon style. It definitely worths a try!"
0,"I took my two children here after going to the museum on a Saturday afternoon.  I ordered a fruit plate to start with and then we were going to share a hamburger.  She asked how I'd like it cooked and I said \""medium\"".  \n\nWhen my fruit plate was dropped off by another person, no silverware or napkins were left.  We started eating the fruit with our fingers.  The waitress walked by and saw us.  I assumed she was going to get silverware.  But then I didn't see her again until she brought the hamburger.  There were so many things wrong at this time.  First, the fact that I had to ask for silverware and napkins in a restaurant is absurd.  Especially seeing that I have 2 children under the age of 4.  I obviuosly need napkins!  But the hamburger was WELL done and absolutely tasteless.  There was nothing on it.  I had to ask for mustard.  When I ordered the hamburger I told her it was for us 3 to split.  She just brought over the hamburger on one plate with no extras.  I had to cut the hamburger into pieces and tear one of our drink napkins to put the burgers on for my kids.\nAt this point I was so annoyed and tired and wanted to leave.  I asked for the check when she finally walked by a few minutes later (she never came by to ask how anything was).  I didn't even want to bother complaining and waiting to get more food.  After a long day, I just wanted to leave.  But I would never come back again."
0,"Hilariously bad.  I signed up for yelp just to write this review.  They make you stand there for 15 minutes avoiding eye contact before finally sitting you.  This is my second time there,  and apparently it happens every time.  Then they strangely forget things in your order hoping you'll just get up and leave.  You're paying the same price no matter what so they don't care if you eat less.\n\nOn my second trip near the end of my meal I ordered some salmon.  They apparently took my order but ignored it.  Then 15 minutes later after nothing I ordered something else because I was hungry.   Then  ten minutes later they came by to ask if I was done with the plates in front of me.  I said yes so they took everything away.  I was still waiting for 2 orders. One from 30 minutes ago.  We decided to wait  5 more minutes before leaving. \n\nThey say all you can eat,  but if you wear out your welcome they will give you worse and worse service until you leave."
1,"Takes all affiliated store gift cards. We got one from a friend and applied additional funds in order to get our little one some gifts.\n\nAisles are a bit narrow with strollers and other customers on a busy day/night. This is about the only store in this outlet mall entirely dedicated to kids and toys. There are a few here and there (VS outlet), with some child items. Has toys for both boys and girls, greeting cards, stickers, video games, etc. Well-stocked, clean, and pretty much in order, every time we visit. (I hate shopping in a messy environment). \n\nGlad that this store has remained here, as the pop-up stores rarely last past Christmas time (like the one that was at Town Square)."
1,"A small caf\u00e9 full of charm, few seats inside, sunny ones outside, great coffee (one of the best Mocha I had so far) \nAnd not even 3$ for a bagel with cream cheese on it ? Yes, I like that"
0,"They close the Hilton Honors lounge on the week ends. Very disappointing because they only offer you one drink card to replace the lounge. Very unusual for a Hilton , seems to be a mini Hilton in many respects. Not what I am use to in services, for a Hilton would be ok as a Best Western and the rates should then be lower."
1,"Saw him on 2/1/13.\n\nHonestly his first song was shaky, I was thinking that if the rest of the night was at the same quality I was going to complain. Luckily the rest of the set was not bad at all and he got his voice, but I think he may have been sick or something as he had to stop and drink a lot. I thought it was part of the act and that the drink was a prop (hey, other reviewers tell me what you thought), but I think he was really having problems.\n\nAnyway, couple of things bothered me:\n1) Tickets were $40 but with an $11(!!!!) Caesar's not Ticketmaster service fee - WTF?!?!\n2) A Newcastle and a Vodka and Pineapple was $22(!!!!) - also WTF?!?!\n3) A Sprite and an unidentified drink was $16(!!!) - triple WTF?!?!\n4) Show is advertised with a 9:30pm start, but it really starts at 10:00, so you get there early so they can sell you overpriced drinks - sorry I am used to decent prices and sometimes having a drink included - call me old school\n\nThe guy at the front - \""Joe\"", complete with burly Italian hitman physique and accent - greeted us and got us to the receptionist for check in. They told us seating was first come first served, so we could go in now or get our seat and come back. Not sure that was really standard, to get our seat assigned, but we appreciated it. A cute black guy named Blake sat us (we didn't tip him for the seat, were we supposed to? I was so clueless!! Sorry Blake - everyone tell Blake the crazy girl yelped about him!) near the bar area right by where the showgirls come out and a foot away from the VIP seats. I'll post pics, but we were in a good area. I think Matt could see me :)\n\nThe show area, Cleopatra's Barge, turns into a no cover nightclub with a DJ after the show. Nice considering nothing in Vegas is free. I would hang out there more if the drinks had not been so high.\n\nOh, Matt only meets and greets VIPS, he, the band and the girls don't come out after the show to hang out with the audience or anything - I think it is mentioned that they do. Because of where we were sitting Matt had to walk by us and he was nice enough to stop and shake hands for a bit. Seriously though, I thought he looked tired.\n\nThe drummer and keyboard player hung out at the adjacent bar for a bit, nice guys, drummer was a flirt :)\n\nThe cool thing was that like an hour after the show we were still hanging around in the busy corridor near the bar and Joe asked us how we liked it - totally surprised he remembered us at all. The blonde retro cigarette girl was nice too.\n\nThe show is good, the Dirty Virgins are good. I am straight and don't usually stare at women, but I admit I stared at the dancer that was firmly planted on top of a table in front of us... will post pics too :)\n\nSongs are good, Hotel California was good, can't elaborate more on the previous positive reviews really.\n\nWill definitely come back again, but I would complain to management if Matt was that off with his voice again. Not complain for a free ticket, a live show is a live show, but they need to maintain the quality because they are doing themselves a disservice to just throw the guy out there if he's not able to perform up to par.\n\nOh, yeah, they don't care if you take pics during the show (turn off the flash) or take video, I have a lot of video LOL. But I would buy his CDs, just forgot to that night."
1,"You may have to wait a few minutes for your juice and/or acai bowl. However, the wait is well worth it!"
1,"Come see mike, great bbc and incredible service. The hands down best potatosald and some of the best chicken chill soup around."
1,"Good Middle Eastern food that's open late late (I'm not sure, but they could be open 24 hours). Naturally a good place to stop for food after the bars and clubs. We were here at 4am last time. Food came quick and was cheap, as well as hot and tasty! Several locations around the city and there's one right across from Gouverneur Hotel where we usually stay."
0,"After seeing the positive reviews I really expected more. I am only commenting on the food, which was mediocre at best.\n\nNot sure if the fries were meant to be like that but they were just burnt. My \""I dont care, whatever\"" burger was ok, definitely not an $11 plus burger though. At least it should have came with a side.\n\nFor those of you who are amazed by the burgers here please give yourself a favor and try Sauce in Bridgeville and you will thank me."
0,"Took some friends who were in town here for dinner. The wait was only about 30 minutes so no complaints there. The sushi was good, not the best but it was decent for the price. One big problem - I GOT FOOD POISONING!\n\nWoke up around 4am and was very sick. I should note that no one else got food poisoning except for me, but nonetheless I have never gotten this sick after eating sushi before and I eat it quite a bit.  \n\nI would recommend checking out Sushi Kaya. I have never gotten sick after eating there and it is very comparable if not better."
0,So far have waited an hour for one burger and one baked potato + one drink has been incorrect. Apparently the machine failed to register the order so discount ahoy
1,Some of the best pizza around. I've been there several times and it is always amazing. The shroom pizza is my favorite by far and the diablo is not far behind (has ghost pepper sauce.) The guys in the shop are super friendly and they are pretty quick as well. I've been to New York and this pizza blows theirs out of the water.
0,"Their customer service is great and the place is nice and presentable but as far as their work goes, it's not the best. On top of their work not being the greatest, I have never seen them sterilize their tools. I've been there several times because they are my last resort when I need something done last minute and out of all the times of been there (6?7?) not once have I seen anyone pick up new/clean tools from the sterilizer. I asked once if they sterilized and they said they did yet I've never witnessed it."
1,"\""The United States Constitution and the Arizona State Constitution guarantee the right to trial by jury. All Maricopa County residents are obligated by state law to serve as a juror unless they are under the age of 18, not a citizen, do not possess sufficient knowledge of the English language, and/or have been convicted of a felony and their civil rights have not been restored....\""     -  Jury Services Home Page, SCAZMC\n\nYou may be asking, \""Why in the world would this guy give THIS place five stars.\""  I can ask myself the same questions.  I've found myself standing before judges, for judgment at least twice, been called dumb (rightly so in that instance) by The State (DPS officer in another state), etc.\n\nI've been called for jury duty several times in two states.  Every time I get into the process I am grateful to live in a place on earth where a person or people accused of violating The State's rules of Civil behavior can be judged guilty or innocent by a group of people, guided by a Judge; not by a king, duke or prince, a dictator, angry mob, or a general who might bill my family for the bullet.  \n\nJury duty is a place We the People can feel and see our system of governance working.   A way of sitting in on the creation of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution.  So's voting.  You can be sure you register to vote here too.  \n\nThat's the shining ideal.  I respect and love it.  We know when the idea is exercised shining ideals get tarnished.  That's the nature of humans, power and justice at this point in history.  Generally speaking, the legal system of this nation works.  Over recent past decades its begun working better for every American.  '\n\nFor me the juror, the most amazing thing about the Superior Court of Arizona in Maricopa County is the new building.  During past calls to jury duty, I've sat hours in dingey brown rooms with uncomfortable, worn out, or both seating.  When you arrive for jury duty here it is state of the art in a well designed setting.  You're checked in through a computer kiosk, issued a badge via printer and can walk to either a large break or group seating area.\n\nThe break room's got a few tables set up for laptop or tablet workstations.  There's a coffee service and small cinnamon rolls.  There are several large flat panels throughout the area with some kind of media playing.   \n\nThe main waiting hall has comfy seating, and again, a medley of monitors.  These monitors have different content.  They run a series of informational programs explaining the judicial system, the individual's role as a juror, and display information for people called to various jury panels.  Another video details Arizona's exemplary system of selecting judges and assuring they are fit for duty.  If you choose, you can watch them before you come in for jury duty.  They play from the Jury Services Home Page.   \n\nJury duty may seem like a pain.  But if you're going to be part of the legal process and called to duty, there's no better place to serve in the 21st century than at the Superior Court of Arizona in Maricopa County.    \n\nI expect there may be flames from this post...."
0,"Slow, disorganized service and a very rude manager who did absolutely nothing to help the wait staff or us. This isn't the first time we've experienced this service, but it's definitely the last. The patio is nice, but there are other options in the area with better service and food."
1,Just tried a new item that will be coming to the summer menu. Was a one day debut for now but watch for it to come back. The Puerto Nuevo Lobster Burito. Great flavor of lobster with rice and beans balanced with a hint of sweet and hint of spice. Mix of hot and cool ingredients worked well together. Good sized burito with a decent amount of lobster for $10. Look forward to having it again this summer.
0,"STAY FAR AWAY: INTIMIDATED AND ROBBED BY STAFF!\n\nI met a girl at the bar who was probably way too into me for it to be realistic. Bought her and myself a drink with cash. She then proceeded to buy many drinks for her and her friends, who then told the bartenders I agreed to pay for their drinks. I vigorously denied it, but was swarmed by three huge bouncers. I asked the bouncers if I could speak to them outside, and they told me I wasn't going anywhere. After a lot of intimidation, I gave them my card, and paid 106 dollars for drinks I never agreed to buy. When I spoke to one of the managers working at the door, he told me the police wouldn't care because the crime was less than 1000 dollars and I should just go get a hooker. Also, because I was dancing with the girl, that was considered proof to them I agreed to buy the drinks. Then they kicked me out and let the girls go.\n\nI feel pretty violated. I want to spread the word to as many people as possible that the place is poison. I can't get my money back, but I can speak as a victim of this scam, and hope to help others to not fall for the same thing I did. Stay away from the Artisan."
0,"The good: service, beautiful, stylish restaurant.  \nThe bad: music from nightclub is a distraction, soup and food was cold, vegetables, soup and Thai noodles were  bland and tasteless.  Expensive for what you get.  You'd be better off at Pei Wei 's or PF Changs.  Unless you are young and headed to the adjoining nightclub don't waste your money here."
1,"How can you not have a great time here.  People paid to make you laugh, and booze.  A match made in heaven.  Add great service and a convenient location (in downtown's CityScape right off the lightrail) and you've got yourself a 5 star rating.\nThe menu could have a few healthier options, and the cocktails could be a tad cheaper, but all in all we had an awesome date night, and we plan to go back...frequently."
0,"I dont know about the other dishes, but their \""pad thai\"" is absolutely  atrocious. I have never tried noodles as sour as sour patch kids  candy until now. Also, enjoy their fake sriracha sauce and chemical hot mustard. If that doesnt get you  hospitalized  i dont know what will. However, enjoy the fortune cookies!"
0,"Everything was good with the food. While still finishing up with food, a lady came up to us and said :\"" we have a reservation pn this table.Is there anything that I can do to help you move along?\"". It was surprising because the place was empty. Another recommendation would have been to move us."
1,"Steamed buns fresh and delicious. Service friendly, sweets good. We enjoyed very much...but I almost don't feel qualified to say how good a bakery it is because this was my first experience with a non-european  bakery.  All I know is we've gone back on multiple occasions to buy the steamed buns and they are always delicious. BTW, we drive about 15 miles out of our way to get them, so, yeah, one could say we like them, ALOT."
0,"This little hole in the wall was recommended by the concierge at the Arizona Biltmore, since we were looking for some authentic Mexican food.  Sometimes a little Taco stand should be just that, a taco stand! \n\nHiding in a huge building, though the building may be bustling and alive during the day, at night it is very dead quiet. We should have known when we walked in and there was NO one around, and the security guard was just happy to see someone.  Now if you want to have an intimate dinner where NO ONE will see you, this is the place!  Cause there is NO one there, and that may be because of the location or it may be because the food is nothing to write home about.\n\nThe food was alright, nothing that made you say, this is someplace I want to savor; as a matter of fact we left most of what we ordered on the plate. Though the service was good, since there were no other customers, it was just us, not much you can do. If you are looking for a nice bottle of wine, this is not the place; they have no selection at all, a house red wine and one other selection or a chardonnay.  \n\nThe bill with tax was over 50 bucks, most of that was of course the wine and a drink.  Got a big kick out of the YELP COUPON on the site when I checked in that promoted a 0% (Yes ZERO Percent off your bill) when you showed them you checked in.  I showed this to our waitress and she said well sometimes it might show up when you refresh, but I will give you a 20% off, which of course she never did.\n\nThere have to be better taco places in Phoenix, I am sure!"
0,"Poor Experience and way overpriced for the quality of food and service.  I might think about going back if the Olive Garden were closed.  The Service was poor, servers circled and were shooting the bull at the bar, had to go find the server to get the check.  It was so hot we sweat so much the booth was wet when we left ...yuk.  The pasta tasted overcooked and cheap, and my steak was full of fat, overcooked on one half and raw on the other.  $150 dollars for two for a bad experience and mediocre food at best.  What a let down, wish I could take it back."
0,Yuck. Dirty. Slow service. Gross food. Taco bell makes better food.
0,"This place really should get 5 stars but it doesn't even deserve 1.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell for starters unless you go there when it opens it pretty dirty with napkins and bits of food on the floor and on the seats. No excuse for this.  Secondly, the bathrooms are ALWAYS disgusting.  Honestly I don't know how it passes inspection with the bathrooms alone.\n\nIt is a great location and the ice cream is pretty damn good. Nothing fancy. It's old school ice cream, and for that it's fantastic.  The non-ice cream items (burgers, sandwiches, etc) should be avoided. Just get the ice cream.\n\nFinally, like others have said the owners (not so much the staff) are on the rude side.  I have seen customers get yelled at because they asked for their table or chair to wiped down.  Maybe over the years they have become jaded seeing the countless number of drunks coming in here and acting like they own the place.  I can tell you that when he was yelling at the customer above she was very polite and it was in the mid-afternoon. I hope that someday this place gets bought by someone who loves customers and much as many people love this place out of nostalgia. For the past several years this place has lost its sparkle and I really would like to see it return to its former glory."
0,"Very mixed feelings about this place.  One criticism about this place is to shape up security.  There was one crazy aggressive partygoer who assaulted my friend, not once but twice- also he grabbed me and ripped my dress.  I fell on the floor yelling for someone to call secuirty and nothing.   eventually i had to find someone.... after some searching we found him and security said they couldnt kick him out.  my friend should of filed a police report, she even had a bruise on her mouth the next day.  \n\nsurrender is like a smaller xs. its newer and flashier, literally with flashing lights lining the area around the pool.\n\n My friend got a cabana here so there was a very short wait, and plenty of drinks and it was very comfortable.  The Cabana is airconditioned and has its own private bathroom.\n\nThe venue is nice, however I don't feel safe at this club and if I did go again I would stay very close to my cabana/table and NOT venture to the dance floor.  There are alot of really bad people out there.  be careful"
1,Foods great. Their dessert selection was good. I ate 6 pcs. of their pistachio merengue ...
0,"This was one of the few times Yelp has led us wrong. Came here because it was close by & had 4 stars. \n\nI will say the service was perfectly fine. Our server was very friendly & even though it was busy, we were greeted at the door & sat quickly. \n\nUnfortunately, it was downhill from the point we got our food. We ordered an assortment of rolls & a dish of pad Thai. The sushi choices almost all include cream cheese &/or tempura, which made it difficult to choose a variety without everything tasting similar.\n\nThe sushi all tasted fishy. I don't think it was unfresh, but it certainly didn't taste fresh either. It was somewhere in between the two...if that is possible. The presentation wasn't bad either, but the overall experience was tainted by the poor tasting sushi."
0,"I can truthfully say that I have spent a huge percentage of my entertainment dollar in Vegas at Krave. I happened upon the place in its heyday, back when you were just as likely to see movie stars and fashion party names grooving to DJ Morningstar (seriously, once I saw Ritchie Rich AND Amanda LePore there in the same night) as you were fantastic queens and their little manservants. The staff was top notch, the mixes were masterpieces and the service in the VIP area was flawless.\n\nI wish I could still say the same today. Instead of an overall rating search, look at the trend of the ratings for Krave and you'll see that the customer experience has steadily gone downhill, perhaps stemming from the establishment's recent bankruptcy filing and reduction in quality talent. The drinks are overpriced, the cover charge seems egregious and the cocktail waiters are completely a mixed bag, some are distracted (overworked?) and disengaged while others seem to genuinely be interested in serving. The carpet in the VIP area was so dirty that my high heels would stick like glue in certain areas. \n\nWe ordered bottle service, including a bottle of absinthe, but apparently they didn't even know how absinthe should be served and had no sugar cubes on hand. I'm not asking for silver slotted spoons or anything but if you have no clue as to the appropriate mixers, you should take it off the menu, hmmm? And at $350 a bottle, if you're out of Grey Goose, you send one of the little bois to the 7-11 up the street to make your clients happy, right? Ok, and also, my diamond shoes were too tight, but let's talk about what really matters: the club itself. The dancers are stuffing their jocks with what seems to be Chunky soup cans, to the point that it's laughable, and the DJ? Oh my god. So not good. Even the staff was commenting that he sucked. What's more, despite the fact that we were dropping close to a thousand dollars in bottle service, the owner of the club decided to block our view of the dance floor and then treated us so disrespectfully when we asked him to move that I couldn't believe he was actually the owner. Seriously, if you treat your supposed VIP customers like this, I'm not surprised that you're facing bankruptcy, Kelly Murphy.\n\nAnd what used to be a crowd rife with a half dozen drag queens, there hasn't been a single queen to be seen the last two visits. Perhaps they are the club's canary in a coal mine and Krave is simply no longer fabulous enough to entertain them. The real tell here is that despite the fact that we were last there on the night that Krave was serving as the Logo afterparty for the Lady Gaga concert, at what should have been the prime thick of the party scene, the dance floor was starting to thin out considerably. It seems that most people were there just to see if the Lady herself would show up and when it became clear that she wasn't, they headed for greener pastures.  I'm following their lead and heading to Piranha next time."
0,"ughhhhhh.....\nLet's negate the price here because the meal was free and I'll still say, quite possibly one of the worst meals I have ever had. My chicken parmigiana tasted like something I microwaved from a Michelinas frozen dinner. On top of that, the waiter was a condescending eegit with a superiority complex. Listen to me and listen to me now, DON'T COME HERE! There are so many good Italian places in Las Vegas, that there is no need to stop at this self-righteous restaurant in The Rio. Do yourself a favor and go to Valentino in the Venetian or Rao's in Caesar's Palace. \n\nCheers!"
0,"If you are Chinese or if you are not and want to have a semi-decent Chinese food, DO Not go here.  It is super expensive, and the food are tasting westernized.   There were only one plate that is slightly edible, the fried mushroom.   Fried shrimps are drenched in oil with a storage taste.  Spare ribs were so hard, i thought there were all bones.  All meat were too sweet.  The Thai pat-ay had a layer of oil on top of it.    There were no sushi or Sashimi at this location.  \n\nYou are better off just go to Burger King or Subway down the street.  After i ate their food, i was really worried about having diarrhea because the restaurant was \""encouraging\"" customers to reuse their plates.   I saw some customers putting food on their used plates and then return food back to the counter after i read the signs.... Yikes.\n\nBut if you really want to have Chinese food and learn your own lessons, please be aware that you may be charged 5 pound penalty for \""wasting\"" food you can't eat or finish. (There is a sign and 10 things posted on each table. You can read them yourself).   So, a smart thing to do is to be selective on the quantities you get from each plate.   I was getting only one bite from each plate so i won't be sorry that they were tasteless as most of there were.  \n\nThe service is average.   In fact, the host/hostess were kind of rude.   You be the judge.   It was probably one of the worst experiences I had.  I can see some teenages who loves going there just to eat tons of french fries and shrimp fries.  But, the shrimp fries were somehow old as well.  How can they do that is beyond me.  The qualities are just not there for a buffet that charges 14 pounds."
1,"Mm Steve's Krazy Subs are delicious!  I've been to the location on Southern and Dobson as well, and they are doing things the same!  Both excellent, tasty, bargain subs!  They call an 8-inch sub a \""mini\"" for crying out loud!  You can get the lunch special for $5 even including tax.  That'll get you an 8\"" sub, Lay's or Fritos, and a small soda!  Excellent!  The way they make the dressings is just so tasty!  Both locations also have a big screen tv that's always playing those comforting sitcoms (\""King of Queens\"" etc.) when I stop in for lunch.  The sandwiches are ready so fast too!  I couldn't ask for a better place to eat on my lunch break.  :)  You can even call ahead and order your sub, though I've never had to wait long when I come in and order either."
0,"This place is DUMP, and I cannot understand how they stay in business! NEVER again! Horrible service, Dirty, crowded, and the food was tasteless and expensive. I had the Nicoise Salad ($20.00) hardly any toppings or tuna, served with this pathetic buckwheat pancake on top. Everything felt dirty from the glasses to the dishes. They dont take Amex like most places in Montreal and dont accept American money. NOt worth the wait, time and money!"
0,"The food was ok. Not very authentic, but tasted ok, and good if you have little kids with simple palates. Service was very poor unfortunately. We waited in the foyer of the restaurant for 5 minutes before anyone even noticed us. Two members of the wait staff were just hanging out at a booth in the bar. The bar tender saw us but did not make eye contact or greet us. I finally had to go interrupt the two servers who where chit chatting at the bar amongst themselves, to see if they could seat us. There was really no excuse for the poor service. There were only two other families eating in the whole restaurant. Sorry, don't think we will be back. When I go out to eat dinner, I expect good service."
0,"Over priced & flavorless\n\nMaybe I'm not \""hippie dippy\"" enough. The place is small & was very busy. The wait was insane for a grilled sandwich, soup & a green juice. The cream of leek & potato soup was the only thing that had any flavor. Although $3.95 for a small cup is a little much. The pesto grilled sandwich w/chicken was over priced as well & FLAVORLESS. So disappointing. The \""be the change\"" green juice was disgusting. All the spirulina was stuck to the bottom of the cup, the people didn't even stir it to make sure it blended with juice. $20 bucks and a 15 minute wait for a sandwich, soup that just had to be labeled out of the pot & gross ass juice is NOT something I'll be going back for. Ever."
0,Wow!  I had to come see for myself...trust the reviews...so sad.  The only items on the buffet I could eat were the prime rib and rolls.  Don't waste your time going for anything but the cookies...the bread pudding has no taste and the vanilla sauce tasted like wall paper paste smells...yikes!  The decaf coffee was ok and the macaroons are to die for...I snuck some out in my purse ;-) for breakfast. I don't want to make a habit out of paying 40 dollars for some really good cookies.
1,Love this place. Best staff. Best subs. Speedy service. 5 stars every visit. We eat here once a week. Something for everyone

1,"The Mirage is a great hotel if you are looking for a nice hotel, in the middle of the strip that doesn't break the bank.  I especially enjoy the Mirage pool and their newly renovated rooms.  The only downside is that their suites are in desperate need of renovation right now as well, and I think they are in the process of doing that, so perhaps my next visit will warrant 5 stars.  If you are looking for a great hotel to have a party (bachelor, bachelorette type thing), then Mirage suites are perfect as they are large and not too expensive.  Don't bother with the Siegrfried & Roy Gardens....for $15 it's a rip-off, however, the \""be a trainer for the day with the dolpihns\"" package sounds cool (but not sure how much that is).  If you do stay at the Mirage, be sure to check out the Beatles LOVE show and BLT Burger.  Japonaise is also awesome. As for gambling....cross the street and play at Imperial Palace for looser slots and cheaper table games.  Good luck and have fun!"
1,"Legit.\n\nAcross from UNLV.\n\nSolid sandwiches easily shared by 2 folks...2 hungry folks.  Salads with fresh, interesting ingredients -- not for the calorie conscious, but definitely flavorful.   And clever combinations...I've not tried it, but am dying to see someone get it -- so I can see it --  a sandwich with fried mac and cheese -- as one of the ingredients.   I like the French Dip -- but I like mine simple -- a tad salty, but definitely good.\n\nThe owner's food (and tattoos) actually have interesting cred on Food Network -- like Matt said, don't let the biker grunge look intimidate you -- these boys are really cooking."
0,This place is disgustingly filled with flies everywhere! Not just a couple. Several hundreds of them. Some constantly buzz around you. And hundreds more just chilling on the ceiling.
0,"Went there last night for dinner with a group of girls.  When I walked in, I felt like I walked into a crappy Vegas lobby/restaurant.  Clientele was what was expected & typical for that part of Scottsdale - at the bar were a bunch of \""brah's\"" who like to act like they have money and their respective female counterparts.  Restaurant area was slightly older crowd - especially with the waitstaff, which I thought was unfortunate.  I expected the server to be a hot babe...girl or guy.  Instead, it was a 50-something-year-old woman with no social skills.\nThe food was also pretty gnarly.  We ordered probably 6 or 7 appetizers before we ordered meals.  I only tried a couple of them - specifically the \""warm maytag blue cheese fondue\"" with potato chips.  ICK.  The dip was horrendous tasting and looked like what my husband calls a \""wax dart\"" if he hasn't, you know, for a while.  The chips were really greasy and just tasted like a potato dipped in oil.  I also tried the \""oven roasted tomato and goat cheese casserole\"" with herb toast.  Another ick.  The toast was alright, but the casserole was like bruschetta gone wrong.  I ordered the \""Grilled Chicken Piccata\"" with the butter sauce on the side.  It was alright - way too much salt and the seasonings tasted off.   \nI don't know, perhaps I went there with the wrong expectations.  I thought the atmosphere wouldn't be as cheesy and I expected to eat \""comfort food\"", not food I wanted to secretly spit into my napkin.  I'll never go back."
1,"Went to Vegas two weeks ago and my wife found a groupon for this place.  We went on a Tuesday night.  The location isn't very visible so I understand why they have a groupon deal.  The place was very nice and professional once you get inside.  Very nice atmosphere with good music.  The first thing I noticed was the bottle of Crystal hot sauce on the table, that's when I knew the food was gonna be bomb!...I was not disappointed.  I had the combo fried crawfish and crawfish etoufee (spell check that for me).  My wife had some fish that was really good but she liked my plate better.  I ordered my food with pasta instead of rice so I had plenty of leftovers and it was better the next day.  We ended up taking friends there that met us in Vegas over the weekend.  Definitely going back."
1,"Best tasting ice water at any restaurant I've ever been to! It did not have that usual nasty tap taste and actually tasted better than any of my favorite bottled waters! I normally drink only half a glass at most at any given restaurant, but I drank 3 glasses here! I wasn't even that thirsty!\n\nWe tried the filet mignon meatballs people keep talking about; they were above average but we did not experience the whoa factor. Chicken marsala was also above average and was the best tasting one I've ever had at a restaurant but it wasn't as good as the one my cousin makes. He notes, however, that the sauce was really well made.\n\nThe free bread was also pro, predipped in oil and very tasty. The olive oil and vinegar were also very nice.\n\nP.S. Hiep, my cousin, wants to add that the service is excellent. The inside is small but the atmosphere is homely."
1,"Great food and even better beer- this is one place I always take out of towners because they are amazed by the size of the sandwiches. There is always a wait so go in knowing that ( they do not take reservations) but stop at the bar during your wait. I highly recommend the Bumbelberry ( blueberry beer and they top it off with fresh berries) or the nice selection of Arsenal cider they have on draft. If you are a fan of wings they make a great starter and many different sauces to choose from. The menu is overwhelming with burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads etc. The salads are big enough to feed a small country but I recommend getting one of the meaty sandwiches. This past visit I went with the beef brisket sandwich topped with BBQ sauce, cheese sauce, pickles, tomato and horseradish sauce.  It was super messy but delicious although a substitute for the roast beef sandwich they took off the menu. The service is usually quick and the servers are average. Great place to go in the summer as they have a very nice outdoor seating area."
0,"My friend and I decided to have dinner here.  The food just awful and service was lacking.  We ordered the vegetable soup which had chunks of ginger, hardly any of veggies or lentils.  The worst part of the meal was the main dish we ordered the tandoori chicken sag it was mushy and the chicken was poor quality chewy and gristly.  My friend pointed this out to the waitress and she told her maybe it wasn't cooked and she would let the cook know and that was it. What kind of response is that?  We will definitely not be back."
1,"First of all, a disclaimer. The only thing I have ever ordered here is the Pho Tai. I spent a semester in Vietnam eating Pho on an almost-daily basis, and now it is my comfort food, what I want when I am sick, tired, or sad.\nThat said, I can recommend the Pho Tai without hesitation. Out of the 3 Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh (this, Vietnam's Pho, and My Ngoc), this has the best pho. The broth is quite good; fragrant and savory. \nI both eaten in here and gotten take-out. Eating in is a pleasant experience. The dining room is tiny but spotless and bright, and the free pots of tea are a nice touch. The take-out pho is packaged very thoroughly and intelligently. In a plastic tub goes the broth, beef and onions. The noodles are packaged separately in a little plastic bag so they don't get soggy before you have a chance to eat. All the fixings, including copious amounts of basil and bean sprouts, are there, including little tubs of hoisin and chili sauce.\nDelicious, authentic pho prepared by a friendly family. The only downside is the cash-only, which is a huge PITA."
1,"Awesome idea for a bar with giant games we used to play as kids!  It's a fun change from all the slot machines and roulette tables.\n\nFriendly staff with happy attitudes that add to the experience.\n\nSaturday nights are my favorite days to go - Live music!  Sometimes they have bands from Hawaii, which really brings out the nostalgia for those who now call the \""9th Island\"" home.\n\nThe food and prices are pretty descent considering it's bar food.  The only con to this place is that they have a tiny parking lot and limited street parking.  But the fact that they even have a FREE parking lot is a plus!  If you can't find parking here, you can always park at a nearby casino.\n\nIf you wanna have fun in a chill environment, this is the place.  I'm definitely taking my friends here when they come to town!"
0,had the worst experience with the food truck at first friday with a  horribly rude employee working the window. I purchased food and saw my food sit on the counter as new orders were stacked on top of mine  3 more orders to be exact. The 4 orders sat for 4-5 minutes waiting on fries and as the orders were being called mine now on the bottom was called last order 96 as i saw her hand out 99 98 97 as i was asking for my order she ignored me as i asked her why it was waiting on the bottom WHEN I DIDNT ORDER FRIES!!!! I still had to wait for them because they were busy then the employee told me to shut up and refused to refund my order. With so much competition its not a great idea to blow off your guests!! Never again;(
1,"It was two days before Christmas and total chaos everywhere except here! Service was excellent, the food was outstanding! My husband and I started with the Mediterranean small bites then each had a pizza. I love their whole wheat crust!  Service was fantastic too!"
1,"I have been dealing with the owner Tony since he was up on 27th avenue and Northern years ago. I drive an '02 Chevy Silverado and my mother drives an '87 Nissan Pulsar. I have found Tony to be one of the most honest and upfront mechanics I have ever dealt with. He gives fair prices for repairs and usually quotes me in aftermarket and GM parts prices so I can decide what I can afford. He has helped me with small fixes at reasonable prices and quick oil changes as well. He always takes care of my 60 year old mother, which is nice considering he could charge more but elects not to do it. He is certified all the way and I have never had any issue with his work after I leave. I trust this mechanic and ever since he moved down to 16th street, he actually has decent parking (thank God) and more lifts.\n\nHe is a good mechanic, one I trust and will continue to do business with."
1,"Note: This review is ONLY for their bakery.\n\nI ordered a cake for the boy's birthday, sight and taste unseen.  I have never been to Hubbard Avenue.  I was drawn in by their online order form that listed sizes, cake flavors, filling flavors, and frosting flavors.  There were just so many options!  And for $12.99!  Sold!\n\nI called up and ordered a mocha cake with raspberry filling and mocha frosting.  The lady on the phone told me how good that sounded.  I know, Phone Lady, I know.  She asked for an inscription.  She then asked if I wanted any particular decoration.  Baffled, I said no, they could do whatever they wanted.  Upon hanging up, I hit myself in the forehead.  I should have specified that the cake was for a 31 year old man, not a 5 year old boy.  Shit.  Hopefully they don't put clowns or pokemon or something stupid on it.\n\nI picked it up, and I was extremely pleased.  It was a pretty little cake, the color of wet sand, with a palm tree on it.  Tasteful (pun not intended)!  Professionalism and prettiness aside, it was a gloriously delicious cake.  The best part really is the mocha buttercream frosting.  I want that frosting on everything I eat from now on.  It'll be worth weighing 400 pounds."
1,"One of my favorite places to go to get Chinese. This location makes a mean General Tso's and chicken fried rice. Portions are pretty good. If you eat inside the place is always clean. Thought the drive up window was stupid at first, but it is nice to have. If you are looking for \""fast food\"" Chinese, this would be the place. Just wished I still lived on this side of town."
1,"For our last night in Vegas, we were looking to do a show and a fancier dinner. And a show and a fancier dinner we did! Our first choice for dinner was booked out a month, so we fell back on our trusty old friend, sushi. This restaurant did not disappoint. My boyfriend made a reservation (just to be safe). We get there and we are promptly seated in the back room; the windows behind our table looked out over the strip. Everything was prompt - the service and the time frame in between ordering our drinks and food and those getting to the table. Not to mention the service was so friendly - for some reason, they speak in rather quiet tones, which normally would frustrate me (I'm mostly deaf) but for some reason, it contributed more to the already soothing atmosphere. It was very intimate and peaceful. My boyfriend got some sashimi, soup, and rolls (forget what, exactly) while I got a little bowl of rice and rolls. The food was great! Normally, I'd go into much more detail, but I'll just leave it at that and let you find out how good it is. Dessert (mochi) was also good, three flavors of your choosing and one piece (which is then halved) of each flavor. I appreciated this, so I could indulge my sweet tooth but not feel overwhelmed/too full from it. Overall, this is a romantic and peaceful restaurant, equally good for couples as well as groups. We went early (6 PM) so this probably helped out with the peacefulness a lot, but nonetheless, I highly recommend it."
0,"I got the pad kee mao and my noodles were a little hard and bland. My friend got pad thai style noodles with crab on top, and his noodles were delicious. Service was friendly albeit slow considering we were the only party there..."
0,"\""We are an amazing restaurant\""  That is the message you get loud and clear from L'Etoile.  The only problem with that message is that it simply isn't true.  Besides, a truly amazing restaurant doesn't need to beat you over the head with how great they think they are.  The restaurant experience speaks for itself.\n\nThe dining room was nice, but had a somewhat cavernous and empty feeling to it.  It just didn't feel very warm and inviting.  I felt somewhat like I was in a fishbowl on display to the capitol square.  The view of the Capitol was nice.\n\nThe service was overbearing.  Every single dish had a long list of ingredients, and each ingredient had a story to it.  I'm definitely a foodie.  I find it impressive when a restaurant will highlight an ingredient and tell you about it's provenance.  At some point though, I would like the waitstaff to disappear so I can actually chat with my friends and not be talked at.  Seriously, waiter, go away!  Let me be. \n\nThe food itself was beautiful on the plate, and in it's description.  Taste was average.  There was not a single bite that I had where I went that was an amazing bite!  My large steak was somewhat awkwardly stacked on top of a small amount of potatoes.  My apple salad was mediocre at best.  Dessert was good, but I have had better.  The food looked, and sounded special, but it just didn't taste that way.  \n\nFor the price I paid, I was expecting a lot more from L'Etoile.  I will not be back because the Madison restaurant scene has too many outstanding restaurants at 1/3 the price of L'Etoile.  This place simply isn't good enough to be charging the prices they are."
1,This place is really underrated. If you get there before 4pm you can get the lunch portion... It's a lot of food! The banana treats they give you after your meal are delish!
0,I had to return the Fish I purchased for dinner just a few hours ago because it smelled bad. I was not able to smell bad fish over the counter. This place still smells clean. This is the second spoiled fish purchase for me from here. The manager said yes that fish smells so the fish monger knowingly gave me bad fish.\n\n I will still stop in for produce or dry goods because I like them here but I can no longer trust them for fish.
1,"There are many Hawaiian restaurants in Vegas, and it's a competitive cuisine to be in.  Island Flavor has every right to be confident that they will be sticking around.\n\nThe Husband first mentioned this place after he saw the sign go up replacing Pho 777.  And he's been there a handful of times before I got a chance to check this place out.\n\nThe first time he went, he was told to order the special and did as he was told.  He remembers it being really good and was telling me all about it.\n\nThe first time I went was to grab a spam musubi to go.  It was pretty busy and I was intrigued.  (The spam musubi was good too.)\n\nThe next time the Husband stopped by for a to go order and brought home the special that had chicken in it.  I remember trying some and thought it was good, although we weren't too happy about the mac salad.  Also brought home a spam musubi too.\n\nWhen I finally had a chance to have a sit down meal there, I ordered the combo ($9.75) of Kalbi Short Ribs \""Tender short ribs marinated in our Korean sauce & broiled to perfection\"" and the Furikake Shrimp \""Jumbo shrimp coated with panko and furikake fried golden brown and served with oriental sauce.\""  It came with two scoops of rice and mac salad.  What an order it was!  Generous portions of three slabs of short ribs and so yummy!  The three shrimps were also a good size and had a nice crust because of the panko.  I was pleased.  It was definitely a lot, and you will need a box for leftovers.  The mac salad tasted a lot better this time around too.\n\nThe  Husband got the combo of Kalbi Short Ribs and Hawaiian Style Roast Pork \""Served open face topped with our homemade gravy\"" and it was a large size order too.  Also served with two scoops of rice and mac salad.  They definitely make sure you don't go hungry here.  He ate up the whole thing himself, and left with a full belly.\n\nAs we were leaving, the Husband mentioned it would just be awesome if they offered dessert.  I told him they did, I saw it on the menu!  I think the next time around he may just save a bit of room for a sweet finish.  I wish they offered my favorite - Pork Lau Lau!\n\nOverall, food is good and generous.  Service comes with a smile and you definitely feel at home here.  They get a lot of business, whether it's the weekend or a week night.  The owner told us they have two restaurants already on the Big Island, so they know what makes a restaurant successful here.  When you're dining in, you feel like everyone knows each other already.  It's a nice feeling.\n\nThey have coupons available on entertainmentbook.com, which we used.  The owner also mentioned they have coupons available on restaurant.com too so we should look into that as well.  (How sweet is it that they tell you about their coupons?!)\n\nThis place will be sticking around - check it out for nicer, more authentic Hawaiian fare.\n\n(Pics posted!)"
0,"Came to this place after seeing a wonderful show at the Symphony. It's one of the only restaurants open before 4pm on a Sunday afternoon downtown and within walking distance from the symphony. Walked in with my mother and aunt and after a few minutes of not being acknowledged, I tried to flag down the server that walked by. \""Excuse me, excuse me, EXCUSE ME!\"". She ignored me and I heard a voice from another female voice from behind tell us that we can seat ourselves. We sat at a booth...it was fairly crowded. \n\nWe waited for about 10 minutes when a gentleman walked by and gave us 3 menu. We were ready to order since we looked at the menu posted in the window outside but before we could tell him that, he ran off. About 5 mins later, we witnessed the female server that ignored me earlier walk to every table in front, behind and beside us but completely avoided our table. She did a full circle and pleasantly talked to every other table but ours. At first I thought that she was just making her rounds but nope she never came to the table to even acknowledge us. \""Maybe she isn't our server\"", says my aunt. \n\nAbout 5 mins later, the male (I think he is one of the managers) that have us the menus asked if he could get us something to drink. We told him we were ready to order and as we were ordering the female server (Emily) walked by and was going to tell him that she could take it but he was almost finished. Emily brings out our drinks along with some paper napkins and requests that we return to her the cloth napkins and silverware that we were provided when we sat down. She said something about we only need spoons. \n\nOk, I'm over this story and getting more annoyed as I sit here still in this place that has AWFUL service so I'm just going to close with this...THIS PLACE SUCKS and Emily needs some customer service training (acknowledge your customers!). Never again."
0,"I would say this place is equivalent to Carrows.  Ok, the last time I went to Carrows was over 10 years ago but it compares to what I remember it being.  The service is slow and our server was so clueless and didn't have any common sense.  For example, my friend ordered a cup of soup and asked for it to come out at the same time as her entree.  The server responded saying \""The soup will come out about 2 minutes before your entree because it won't fit on my tray\"".  Uhhhh, yeah, we understand that food for 9 people won't hit the table EXACTLY at the same time.  Just bring the food and soup around the same time!!  Annoying.  Anyways, as the meal went on, the service didn't improve but it was okay because most of us were tired and semi hung over so we weren't in a hurry to get anywhere.  Their breakfast foods are typical.  Egg white scramble was ok, the lox and bagels could have been better and fresher, their sausages had a really weird consistency, the huevos rancheros looked good but the person that got it barely touched, not because she was hung over but because it tasted horrible, the tomato bisque tasted like marina sauce.  Typical cafe food but fine if you're feeling sluggish and you want to eat something without getting dolled up."
0,No longer open in the sun coast casino!!!\nClosed for months\n\nHow can this been on yelp. Incorrect info!!'
0,"We had visited the place during 4th July weekend. Right as we stepped in, we felt that the host was non-welcoming. The lunch buffet didn't really have enough options if you were a vegetarian. So we ordered a la carte. The curries were ordinary, and surprisingly even the breads weren't good. What we were most dissatisfied with, was their service - sloppy to say the best."
1,"Not a lot to say other than great southern comfort food. Good fried chicken, great beef ribs. Small servings of ribs, but great flavor. Loved the collard greens and coconut cake. I'd go back. Definately worth trying."
1,"We probably frequent this place once a week. It's seriously THE BEST pizza in Las Vegas hands down. My man is from NY, and is VERY picky. Something about the hard water here makes the pizza crust tough, and in NY they have soft water? ANYWAYS, he loves it, so I guess that means they are doing something right.\n\nService is great! The manager has stopped by a few times to ask us how everything is. The menu is simple, we always get a Large Sausage/Mushroom. The pizza sauce is tangy, and flavorful! They use fresh mozzarella instead of processed. You can tell their ingredients are high quality. We have also tried their Small House Salad - totally big enough for 2 people to share - it's fresh, and crisp, and exactly what a salad should be. Also try their Antipasto plate, it's amazing as well.\n\nCan't say enough good things - maybe that's why it's our weekly pizza stop :)"
0,"Eating vegetarian there is just not that exciting to me...I've eaten enough hummus in my life that it's no longer exotic or unique to get a plate of plain hummus with some pita. Maybe for others hummus is still exciting?\n\nI had their blueberry shake a few years ago and thought it was wonderful but got heartburn afterwards, so I've never tried it again. I would recommend it though. It's made from yogurt and blueberries (I can no longer tolerate cow yogurt). I like their tofu scrambles too.\n\nI would have given it three stars if not for the last experience I had here at the indian school location. I got the salad, on special and thought it was too acidic and needed some protein to mellow it out...like nuts. About halfway through (because I'm distracted by feeding my child), I remember that the menu said it came with pine nuts. I stop eating and try to flag down the server. About five minutes later (not kidding...poor service) when I'm about to just walk to the kitchen window myself, the server sees me. I explain it to him and he goes to the kitchen with my plate. They say they did put nuts on it. I said, no they didn't. And then they say they did and they're sorry, but they can't give me more. ???\n\nYes, now you all know that either I have short-term memory loss or I like to lie to get lots of pine nuts because I have a pine nut addiction and I just HAVE to have them and will go so far as to lie to my waiter to get them. Wtf.\n\nI didn't eat anymore of the salad. I lose my appetite when people falsely accuse me of lying (especially about pine nuts). I don't need to go back to Pita Jungle. The hummus was overrated anyway! I can just go to the Mediterranean deli on 16th st!"
0,"They really need to work on their customer service. Went here because I told my relatives that they actually have really good pho but next time I'm just gonna take the drive to Pho Kim Long since it took what felt like 40 mins to prepare 4 bowls of rare steak pho with tendons. \n\nThe sad part was that it wasn't busy at all. The girl seated us and walked away and we waited like 10 mins before a different girl took our drink orders. THEN the original girl came and asked for our drink orders. Drinks took about freaking 10 minutes. I could see the lack of communication there. And I also noticed that 2 people walked in and were waiting to be seated and when I was looking at the workers they were just standing around talking to each other and the lady got her own menu and sat herself and her friend down. And then there was a worker behind us, (I'm assuming maybe the chef) who was just talking to the people behind us for the whole 40 minutes of waiting for our food (I just really hope he was off of his shift). Anyway, perhaps they should put a note on their menu that pho take an extra hour to cook. I just didn't understand why it took SO long when it wasn't even busy and we asked for RARE steak pho. You don't even have to cook it! To top that off they forgot to add in our tendons and we wait another 5 minutes for that to come out. You can probably imagine how irritated we all were. \n\nSo the pho just tasted decent too. The broth wasn't even boiling hot. It felt as if the our food was just sitting in the kitchen for a while. Everything just went wrong for us at this place. \n\nNEVER again! Even if the pho is good, the customer service here makes you lose your appetite."
1,I used to go here when I lived in Charlotte the First time. I recently moved back so we returned to las margaritas hoping it was as good as I remembered it.  It was better!  The prices are reasonable and the portions are pretty large (def can take half for lunch the next day).  I feel like it's def one of the more authentic Mexican restaurants in the area.  No nasty velveeta like some other places in the area. My family's Mexican and when I took my parents here they both approved.  Try it out!\n\nPs- the carne asada is awesome!
0,"My girlfriend owed me a steak dinner for my birthday at the steakhouse of my choice. We had pretty good luck at Smith & Wollensky's the year before so I would have been OK with that. At the last minute she suggested SW at Wynn because she wanted it \""to be something special\"". Now in retrospect, going to a steakhouse owned by someone who calls himself a \""vegan\"" is like trying to buy an assault rifle from Ghandi and I wish I had known. My girlfriend ordered the crab soup for starters, hated it and did not finish it. The rib eye was just OK with a very small \""collar\"", the fatty part that makes it takes good. But the part that stands out was that the waiter NEVER ONCE came back after we got our order to check on us. Just not acceptable in this price range. I may be coming back to Wynn but definitely not to SW Steakhouse."
0,"Was not impressed, and will not return."
1,"I had to plan a bachelor party dinner for a group of 25 so I had to find two places (one for each night) that would accommodate such a group without any hassle.  Grand Lux sat us in their back room which was a really nice atmosphere and they dedicated 3 servers to us, which was a big plus!  So many times restaurants will only commit one server to a large group which only leads to delays and dissatisfaction.\n\nIf you have to plan a large group dinner, I highly recommend Grand Lux Cafe.  The food is amazing, the prices are extremely reasonable, and they don't require any of that deposit/contract nonsense when you try to book for a large group.  Plus they are open 24 hours a day so you can book for whatever time of the day."
0,I went here because it was highly rated on yelp. Not a good idea. Everyone mentioned using a coupon so I called and ask how I use a coupon. They said just mention it when you stop in. I arrived within one hour of my phone call and mentioned that I was the caller that asked about the coupon. He did the test and told me that he would deduct the coupon. My receipt for the DMV showed that he deducted the coupon but he didn't give me a credit card receipt because of their credit card scanner I guess cant print them. Well of course when I looked at my credit card online that evening I saw he DID NOT TAKE OFF THE COUPON. I called the next day and asked him to refund my credit card. He tried or pretended to try and then said he could do it. He said I would have to stop in and he would give me cash. So I had to take my time and gas and drive back there to get the $2 he failed to give me to start with. I am sure that most people don't take the time to go back and get the money and that they do this on purpose. My advice is to go to a $10 smog shop not in a repair shop that doesn't require coupons. Don't go here if you expect to get $2 off their already higher price!
0,"Not the same as I remember since I moved. It not worth the money . I just wanted to know if it is the same as I remember. There no heart or passion in the food. For new Mexico food,  visit the state of New Mexico for the food."

0,"I've eaten a lot of good authentic thai food in my life...this was not even close to what I would call decent thai food.  It was edible.  I'll give it that...but that might just be because I was starving. The chicken pad thai was greasy and pretty flavorless until I slathered it in chili sauce.  Also, the thai tea was WEAK...no strong flavor and almost like they used regular milk or skim milk on top.  I'll even go as far as to say this is the worst thai food I've ever had.  \n\nService was just okay.  The place was deserted and nobody checked to see how our food was until we were pretty much finished.  \n\nI won't be returning.  Sorry Karen."
1,"Ended here after our Xmas night out, different to the norm but really enjoyed it. 1st jazz band good but 2nd, more funk jazz were fab. Lots of dancing, drinking and fun had by all. V busy too..."
0,"Fun place but when you're in your early-mid 30s and have a tad bit of style other than local carny  then you will stick out like sore thumb.  We're really into vintage midcentury 1950s pinup style themed anything, but you really couldn't tell this is what the cannery is going for besides the picture on book of matches and the two bar names, \""pinups\"" and \""Marylyn's lounge\"" ....other than that the cover band rocks and I got rush week college wasted like I do every time in Vegas, or Whitney for that matter."
0,"I'm not sure what happened but this place went downhill fast!! Ordered a pizza last night with sausage, cheese and fresh basil.. the baked the fucking basil so it turned black and nasty.. the sausage tasted like it was on the verge of spoiling, very gamy!! Plus the older woman behind the counter was not pleasant at all.. where is the old man, I miss his surly service and his killer pies!"
1,Good pho! Pretty good service. I guess good atmosphere if your in to that type of thing.
0,"We agree with others that the bagels are average, definitely not superior. Better bagels can be found in Scottsdale at Big City Bagels. The food is generally expensive for this type of fare. The hours are nice for those who want to get an early start to the day  (they open at 5:30 AM). The owner likes to keep it pretty chilly in the restaurant. Their excuse is that the workers are warm. Never mind the customers I guess. Also, they have the music jacked up too loud making it difficult to hold a conversation or relax and read the paper with a sandwich, coffee, and paper. We also didn't like the fact that in the December 2013 restaurant inspections, they had seven violations. By far the most of any other restaurant rated in the paper for that month. Just by looking at the place it's pretty easy to tell why that is. Not overly clean and not much attention given to the ambiance."
0,"I've gone here several times specifically for bakery items, and every single time I go there is an employee behind the counter that completely ignores me.  I've tried the casual clearing of the throat, the gentle rapping on the counter, a very lady like \""excuse me\"" or \""hello\"" and none of it works.  \n\nSo you may be thinking to yourself \""well its time to get rude!\""  Yeah, I've tried that too.  I've raised my voice.  \""HELLO?  I'VE BEEN WAITING OVER HERE FOR A WHILE NOW.\""  Yet every single one of those bakery employees keep their backs to me and utter not a word.  Once they finally saunter over to you they are nasty, nasty little women who look like they want to scratch your eyes out.\n\nThey don't say \""how can I help you?\"" or \""thanks for waiting,\"" they screech \""WHAT DO YOU WANT!!?\""  You dare to speak your request and they scowl and let out the biggest miserable sighs imaginable.  Then they start pointing their crooked fingers at various items and bark \""which one?!??  This one??!  This one?!?!!!!?\""  \n\nWorking in the bakery at Copps must be a nightmare, or they aspire to only hire people who don't have one nice bone in their bodies.  \n\nEither way, I think they eat small children."
1,"Great food & service. Have driven by there for years and finally decided we needed to give it a try, glad we did.\n\nGuacamole as a starter. Had the Chile Verde \""Mauser\"", superb!

1,"Our visit started a bit rocky but once the road was righted I could see that this is an impressive restaurant and bar (and liquor store).\n\nThere we two groups at the hostess stand when we walked in and we took our place in line.  There seemed to be a bit of chaos with the staff behind the podium and when we reached the front of the line we were told the hostess called in and servers were trying to cover her duties.\n\nWe were shown to our table and the experience was nothing but stellar from that point forward.   A super cheery, but not fake, waitress came to take our order.   I promptly choose the Saturday morning brunch requisite; a Bloody Mary.   The Merchant take is excellent.  For starters one can take the traditional route and have their drink with vodka.  Or you can substitute gin and have a Bloody Margaret.  Or a Bloody Maria (tequila instead of vodka) is also an option.\n\nJudging by the glasses of fresh herbs on the bar rail and the extensive selection of spirits behind the bar I knew their bloody mix would be homemade, and most likely tasty, before the drink even arrived.   The good news is the drink completely lived up to my advanced hype.  The mix had layers of spices, Worcestershire being the deepest, then some hints of horseradish and a bright finish of celery salt on the end.   Garnish was simple, but as long as the mix is good it's a good drink for me.\n\nThe special of the day was a market omelet filled with fresh vegetables.  Since we had just come from the Farmer's Market  this sounded like the perfect choice.  Fresh shiitake mushrooms, asparagus, sunchokes, and spinach.  All were well seasoned and sauteed in olive oil before being stuffed inside the light and fluffy omelet.   A side of rosemary and parmesan potatoes rounded out the dish nicely.\n\nOur service was wonderful - not too attentive but not neglectful either and she really did a good job on creating a fun and positive atmosphere.\n\nAnd back to the aforementioned liquor store.  It's not exactly a store per se (see my photo) but there is an entire wall full of spirits and wines for retail purchase.\n\nThere's many places in Madison I'd like to try for the first time, but I have a feeling I may be back at the Merchant for again before I get through that list."
0,"The restaurant looks inviting, and like a good time. However, the two pizzas i've eaten there have been rather subpar, and the service has been some of the worst in the city. Both times i've been there we waited 15 minutes until someone came to our table. That's about what can sum up this place. Others may enjoy, because it brings one of the few more upscale restaurants to oakland, but it still just does not do it for me."
0,"So I decided to give in to the hype and we got our drink to go, and for $15 it was completely overrated!  The frozen hot chocolate tasted like something that could have been easily made at home, so I wasn't super impressed.  I agree with the other reviewer, Coffee Bean is definitely better and has less sugary options."
0,"Are you kidding me?!  This was the worst KFC ever.  I was forced into eating here bc it's relatively close to CLT where I was picking someone up.  \n\nI bought the $5 KFC meal, 3 boneless chicken meal.  First of all, you'd think how cool, it's a $5 meal, what a steal!  The chicken is much smaller, the side dish is like 8 macaroni and the biscuit was a pebble.\n\nBut the absolute worst part about it was the fact that the chicken was incredibly salty.  No, like really salty.   After the meal, the sides of my tongue still felt like they had a lot of salt on it.  It's like they dropped the chicken into a salt vat after dousing it in soysauce, and THEN marinated in the Dead Sea (for you worldly knowledgeable peepz!)\n\nService was incredibly slow. Sister was flying in from Cedar Rapids, I'm pretty sure I placed the order before she took off and she still arrived before my meal.  She had a layover in Chicago too because of Barry.\n\nTerrible.\n\ndmo out."

0,"False advertising on Travelocity. You will not get the newly remodeled rooms they show you on Travelocity. The pool chairs are disgusting. The two Yvonne's at the front desk are not very friendly at all. The food at the restaurant was nothing to write home about. No refrigerator and the bed hurt my back. Not sure how this place is still in business. I will NEVER stay here again. Not worth the drive, just stay in downtown Scottsdale or Talking Stick. \n\nThe two stars is for the hotel staff (not the front desk people) and the beautiful backdrop of the surrounding mountains."
1,"Unique (well, there's the Mon one), kitchey, functional (locals grumbled as our tour of PIT trolleys made its final stop, and hampered their uphill commute home...). Come on it's only $2, and the view from the top is spectacular. Our guys had to be pryed outa the machinery room, but that's just the Society for Industrial Archeology..."
1,"I usually hate going out to eat Mexican food but this place is really good. I had the steak fajitas med rare twice on a recent weekend trip to Vegas and I was suprised by how good they were.\n\nThe bottomless chips and salsa is great, especially the pico de gallo which has a kick to it."
0,"I've eaten here three times. The first time, our server didn't know what toro was. Umm... For realzies? Outside of that, service was acceptable. Sushi was okay.\nThe second time, the service was slower than a geriatric slug. It was stupid ridiculous. Sushi was okay.\nThird time, service was acceptable and sushi was okay. Why did I keep going back? The second time, the wait at New Zealand was too long. The third, my friend convinced me to give it one my try. Hmm."
0,"As one writer wrote, the furniture is uncomfortable; picnic style no backs.  My husband and I had the lamb and mint pasty and the \""Oggie.\""  Both were dry, heavy on potatoes.  The beef in the Oggie was tough and tasteless.  The cole slaw was merely shredded cabbage with mayonnaise.  No tang or crunch.  Looked intriguing, but if you are there for the food and not the bar scene, it isn't much."
0,"THE GOOD:  Tortillas...soft, light, oozing with freshness...its all about the tortillas at Carolina's...and looking straight over the food counter into the kitchen where the cooks are lovingly tossing and stretching each piece of dough by hand\n\nTHE AVERAGE:  Bland decor and cafeteria style furniture  that they seem to have inherited from previous incarnation of this location\n\nTHE UGLY:   The fillings here have flavors so subtle (bland) that I couldn't taste much...looking around at the packed dining room, I thought may be I ordered the wrong thing...so I kept ordering...by the end of the meal I ate my way through the green corn tamale, the foot-long burro with house made chorizo, the machaca burro, the soft taco machaca and the green chile burro...I'm sad to report that  I couldn't find any tasty filling in all that\n\nI wanted to like this place, but in the end, can't find a reason to come back."
0,"This used to be my favorite place to eat Mexican food.. The place gone down, the service is bad as well as the food. They raised the prices and the food was either burnt or half cook."
0,"Walk into this place at 9:00pm... Wanted a side salad, I ask the cashier what dressing do they have, she replies no salads are made after 8:00 pm... Really??? Why have a menu you don't comply with.. The worse part about it, I ordered to slices of pizza for me and my husband.. Pizza was cold and tasted awful!! This place sucks.. Will not recommend!!!"
0,"Slightly outdated, but large rooms.\n\nROOM:\nMy friend booked the regular queen suite.  All rooms are suites so our room was huge.  In addition to the two queen beds, there was a living room area and a long counter space which also served as the bathroom vanity and included an in room safe and mini fridge.  Our room was clean but fixtures are clearly outdated.  Our bathtub was clogged and didn't drain fast enough so you feet sat in a pool of your shower water.  Our friend stayed on another floor and he said his room looked more outdated than ours.\n\nHousekeeping was a huge issue.  We were here during one of Vegas' biggest weekends of the year.  Before we went to dinner, I called housekeeping at 8pm to ask to clean my room.  They told me they didn't have time but they could bring us towels and toiletries.  People leave their rooms at all hours of the night so not being properly staffed at 8pm was ridiculous.  I said we would be leaving our room so they could come in and leave the towels on our bed.  When we got back a few hours later, I was appauled to see what had happened.  They left all the towels in front of our hotel door...ON THE FLOOR.  Disgusting and so unsanitary!\n\nNext time, I'd rather pay a bit more to stay on the strip at a place boasting better rooms and better service. \n\nWHAT TO KNOW:\n*Located off the strip\n*Rio charges a per night resort fee\n*Free wi-fi...for one device (ridiculous only one device in my opinion)\n*11am check out but if you call down, they'll usually extend it to noon\n*Complimentary shuttles that run to other Harrah's properties\n*Complimentary valet parking and self parking areas\n*Separate check in and check out lines for Total Rewards Members"
0,"Looked like a cute place and it's right down the street and locally owned, so I was excited to try it out.\n\nI think the staff (it looks like they might all be related) have been huffing toxic fumes in the kitchen.  The braincells were severely lacking throughout the place.  \n\nI went there for breakfast, but I don't eat eggs and I don't drink coffee...this has never been a problem at any restaurant in the world...except for Drip.  They couldn't comprehend that I don't eat eggs...so basically I was ordering a breakfast sandwhich they had on the menu minus the egg (bread & ham).  This caused a 4-minute confused slo-mo conversation at the table and then the chef ( mom?) came out 5 minutes later and we had to do the the entire conversation again.  All of which was entirely unnecessary, but heaven forbid they make a lunch item for breakfast...even though the components are exactly the same and lunch started in 20 minutes.\n\nThe tea tasted average, but came in this time-consuming, over-the-top delivery system that was completely unnecessary.  It took forever for the simple-minded server to put it all together.  The server also liked hanging out at our table looking at us during our entire meal and taking things we weren't done with yet...like my half of my drink.\n\nThis was one of the most annoying dining experiences I've ever had.  Pretentious, snotty, AND simple-minded...weird!  At least when I got my food (which was still totally wrong, but it didn't have egg in it and I didn't want to talk to anyone there anymore so I ate it) it tasted good for what it was (wrong).  Everything seemed to be organic.  \n\nIf you have two brain cells and like good food, this may be the place for you...just don't confuse them...their heads might explode."
1,"Decided to stop by this particular F&E on my way back from running errands... I just got into F&E recently, and I'm totally loving it! The only thing I really have to ding them on is that the inside spaces of the couple of F&E stores are usually small so it's easy to almost run into people all of the time in the small aisle spaces. It is a little bit bigger than the one on E Tropicana, though.\n\nIt's nice to find great deals on good quality items and I love the variety of prepared foods at a good price, which I'm really surprised about. I've tried going to Whole Foods before and I find that they grossly overprice everything, so for someone on a college student budget like myself, F&E totally suffices. And they seem to sell foods that are always fresh (something that all markets don't really keep up with).\n\nI will definitely be making a lot more trips to F&E stores in the future! Hurry up and open a closer one to UNLV! ;)"
0,"If you are into partying and insanity, this is the place for you.\n\nIf you are over 25 and want to enjoy Las Vegas, this is NOT the place for you.\n\nWe ate at several places in Cosmo so we were in here often but we just went in to eat and left.  Freaking insane!   People were falling down drunk, people were half naked (and not in a good way), and we saw arrests on several occasions.  \n\nLeave Cosmo to the teeny boppers and head over to Aria or anywhere else for that matter."
1,"Amazing and friendly !!our service is always top notch. We used to dine at Sushi-Mon every time , that was until the first time we came here and haven't looked back since!! This is the spot to try!! Don't let the last 3 terrible businesses located here change your mind!! This place is remodeled and completely cleaned up!! Fresh fresh fresh , what else do you want at a sushi bar!!"
0,"This place is ass... \n\nSome friends of mine were coming into town to see a specific DJ so I decided to meet them. If I had known what Axis Radius was like I would have stayed home. \n\nThis place must have rocked 15 years ago but now it just seems kind of sad. I'd describe the atmosphere but to be honest there wasn't any. If despair is a theme then Axis Radius nails it. \n\nThe crowd was an awkward hodgepodge of drunks, out to pasture party boys and desperate women. \n\nThe drinks were pricey but strong and the go-go dancers were definitely easy on the eyes, hence the two star rating. \n\nMaybe it's my fault for going. It could be that I'm not the right sort of person to go to Axis Radius. If so, I'm totally ok with that."
0,"If it wasn't for the bartender Alex and the great selection of beers, this place had one major negative. Whoever the African American partner is, he is a complete A-hole. Had no understanding of what a customer represents. If you want to come in and play a song on the jukebox good luck. He justifies it by claiming to offer you the oh so lucky chance of using his credits to play songs. This may sound very juvenile and immature but I got into an actual vocal and quite loud argument with this jackass about him putting so much money into the jukebox without anyone being able to play their own. He is a clown. Told my girlfriend she \""made no sense\"" about not being able to play anything. Very rude and very self centered. You own the place, don't be a dick."
0,"Found this online on a \"" top 10 \"" places for breakfast site ..... not sure who's actually going and eating at this place before adding it to the list ???...\n \nThe place was cute from the outside... looked promising ....**  inside kinda burst your bubble !! \nThe staff was very friendly and service was just fine ....\n**  putting the feel of the inside...aside ... the food left very little to be desired !!\n\nLike another reviewer wrote... breakfast is a favorite meal of the day  and I am always wanting something fresh , yummy and made with really good ingredients... whatever it may be ...\nLet's just say , the blueberry pancakes will never be one of my favorite breakfast memories !!\n Although the blueberries were fresh .... the cakes were very Dry ...and the batter was so bland it tasted like cardboard... if it weren't for the sub par maple syrup ...it would have been inedible.... I ate one cake out of three. ...\n\nMy husband got an omelet .. ham, cheese and tomato... hard to go wrong there ...  it was ok... nothing special but definitely better than the cakes ...\n\nWe had breakfast the next morning at Butterfields just down the way a few minutes and it ROCKED !!

1,Love this place!! Great carne asada and the sweet corn tamale app is so good its like eating dessert!! Chips are always warm and the three salsas are great! Great margaritas....favorite is the top shelf with floater of Negra Modelo!!
0,Went here when we got in town. Everything was old or frozen or just not fresh I was told good food it so wasnt. Waitress was rude had no sense of customer service we were pretty much abandoned worst service and wasnt even busy.
1,"I have little to add, the best damn doughnut I've ever had, period.  And, for the reviewer or two who said things like \""my grocery store has doughnuts too\"", or \""Dunkin Donuts has more variety\"" I say please, stop shopping at Greenbush and take your stunted palette back to SAMs Club and leave the best for the rest of us.  More for me, that's what I have to say."
1,"A huge patio AND half off all bottles of wine on Tuesday nights?! Lunacy. \nIf this place wasnt so damn far from my house, I would spend every evening overlooking the mountains enjoying this place. Its a bit hidden at 105th St and McDowell Mountain Ranch Rd so let up on the peddle, lead foot, and dont miss the strip mall on the southwest corner where you'll spot CP.\n\nFood is excellent and the waitstaff is friendly.  Great atmosphere for a date too.  Ask about monthly wine tastings (I recommend the Chalone Pinot Noir) and specific hours...they are not currently open for lunch that I know of."
1,"The House of Blues, has always been my most favorite place to watch a live concert. I've seen everyone from Incubus, Trapt, Finger 11, Seether, Modest Mouse, Erykah Badu, The Black Crowes, Crossfade, etc..  And has always been more affordable, because it really isn't a huge Venue.  and they have 3 bars attacking you from 3 sides.  Left, Right, And Behind!!  No! They don't have one on the stage. I think 3's enough!!  Other venues just charge too damned much.  Corporate Assholes!!!!  Yes Ticket Master, I mean Ticket Price Hoarders!!!!!  Hehehe!!"
0,"Ace Hardware is that store that usually has one of everything including those hard-to-find items. When Home Depot or Lowes doesn't have what you're looking for then you have no choice but to hit an Ace. \n\nThis location is a good location. The employees are Johnny on the spot so finding things is a breeze and you're in and out in no time. Downfall, prices are ridiculous and they only take returns from their own location. Even though they have that major store name they're all independently owned and operated. Nothing is more frustrating than going out of your way to return something you've been holding onto for a while and then finding out because you didn't buy it there, they won't take it back even though it has their name on the product.  \n\nUnfortunately, Ace Hardware's are a necessary evil and you're looking to find those hard to find items. Can't say I won't ever come back but I will say that I will go the extra mile out of my way to time."
0,"Not impressed with these scam artists. I went to The Range at Ballantyne for the first time yesterday. After I got checked in and watched the safety video, I had to wait 10 minutes while they figured out which lane another customer was on so they could charge him. It was like watching the three stooges use a computer for the first time. Once I got on the range, I was happy to find that it was state of the art and had a good 30 minute shooting session using a pistol. Then the bait and switch happened. It is supposed to be $19/hr pistol, $25/hr rifle. When I was rung up, it came up as $25/hr. They said because I used FMJ I was charged the rifle rate. Pistols rate is only allowed if you use Total Metal Jacket (TMJ). Not once was this brought up until it was time to pay. Because they only allow full hour sessions and after tax, my 30 minutes of shooting pistol cost $27!!! NEVER AGAIN!"
1,"Cheap Vietnamese food, little portions but the hot pot looks cool. Do not get the pork vermacheli, such a little portion. Food is good, stick with the pho and so down to try the hot pot looks generous and cool!"
1,I have been going to The Keg Steak House now ever since they first opened. I have enjoyed everything from the ambiance  to the wonderful food and the servers are great. I highly recommend this restaurant. Alot of quality for the price.
1,"This is one of the very few SERVICE stations left on earth. They have been around forever, keep current and provide quick to extensive repairs. They have helped me out with dead batteries and even racing fuel for my exotic car. They charge a bit more for petrol but you get your oil checked, the glass cleaned and the tires checked. They are also friendly and professional. This is an excellent resource to have and to keep here in da hood of PV."
1,"I visited Tina's Nails from a recommendation and just gotta say, that the staff was wonderful! Everyone was so nice and gave me suggestions on what to do w/ my nails since i'm a manicure-virgin! i had to tell myself to go and get pampered and i chose the right place to go! they went thru the services they offered and suggested colors for me and were so friendly! The salon is VERY clean and spa chairs are so comfy! Looks like i'll have to get in to the habit of pampering myself more- with a great place that is happy to have my business, and treat me like family, why not?!"
0,"Just speaking to the floral side of things, I went in today looking for a nice potted flower thing fit for a balcony (as a present to my girlfriend).  After reading the reviews on here, I expected this place to be amazing.  When I got there, I was a bit underwhelmed by the flower selection, especially the potted/ in basket selection.  In addition, when I walked in, I was only told by one girl \""tell us if you need anything\"" as she rushed to the back, and that was the last time I saw anyone.  After walking around looking for something that fit my needs for awhile, and not having anyone approach me or come out of the back to help, I ended up leaving without buying anything.  I'm not trying to be a complainer here, but when you're just sort of addressed out of the corner of someone's eye as they are running to the back to work on something, and then ignored for the next ten minutes, you don't feel very wanted as a customer.  I understand they probably get a lot of big orders from weddings and such, but I still don't feel that is any reason to ignore an individual customer."
1,"The pizza here is fantastic. The atmosphere is good. Nice for big parties, or just for a few. Families OK too. Last visit I tried the Picante pizza, says it's spicy, but wasn't really that spicy, but Very Good! Service was very good also. I'll be back."

0,"I made an appointment because I had an terrible, stabbing ear ache. After waiting nearly an hour after my appointment time, I was quickly ushered into a tiny room and without being asked anything, I was given a hearing test. I never asked for it and don't know why it was done. Then after another long waiting period, the doctor finally saw me and he tells me I have hearing loss. He looks into my aching ear and bluntly tells me I have no infection but rather TMJ which really, really scared me. I think he was wrong because two days later I had infected bumps on the side of my face and after it cleared, no more pain. The entire visit was a horrible waste of time which didn't help me at all and took nearly three hours!"
0,"I should have stuck with my initial poor impression of this place from years ago.  It was evident from my recent visit that this is a \""money-making comes first\"" kind of place.  Do not waste your hard-earned money  Go to Costco or an ophthamologist at a true medical facility.\n\nWas made to wait 30 minutes, taken to an exam room, and then told to remove my contacts.  I do not wear contacts.   I was then told that I would have to pay cash to see the doctor since what I was there for was apparently a \""medical\"" appointment.  Isn't that why I have vision insurance?\n\nFrustrating all around."
0,"I have to remind myself that this is bar and I am rating bar food. So I kinda feel silly because it is bar food, so maybe I shouldn't be so harsh? I came primarily to try the poutine fries, but of course also ordered a pizza. We placed our poutine fry order, and it took 30 minutes for them to come out, it was a small order and we were the only people in the dining area. Our server was always coming around checking on us, so I know it wasn't her fault for the delay, so we couldn't really figure it out. Was a little strange to get your app at the same time as the meal. As for the pizza, it is Sicilian style (rectangular) which I'm not a huge fan of because I like crust, so you have an entire mid section of pizza that is all alone because I eat around it. We ordered half margherita and half back home. When the pizza came out it looked good, but as I got a couple bites in, it started to taste gross. They bake the pizza with the basil on it instead of putting it on after, so the basil is wilted and burnt, the tomatoes tasted canned and the cheese was gross to look at after 15 minutes, it became hard and formed, and the crust had an overwhelming taste of yeast, clearly not quality ingredients. Again, I realize I'm at a bar. My stomach has been a little upset since I ate. The two things this place has going for them is the Pandora station they play and the poutine fries, but I'd never come back and wait 30 minutes for them."
1,"Yes, it's middle-class and poshish, and expensive-- for Embra-- but they do the stuff up right... mostly.\n\nGuinness is passable.\nThey've got Innes & Gunn on tap.\nThey make a mean, mean, martini - glasses inthe freezer, crushed ice, not watery, and they know what they like in a martini.\nThe same goes for the Mojitos, if my mate has anything to say about it. \nA fairly wide selection of ales.\n\nI know nothing about the food situation, but if you're looking for something different from the pub scene, this is a nice comfortable place with lovely staff who are talkative & patient."
0,I love the idea of this place but I bought a groupon and you have to sign in on line within 30 days or it won't let you and they never answer the phone or return phone calls or email and when you go by no one is there I don't know how they keep running specials I suggest don't by a group on and the instructors aren't very pleasant to be around good luck I had to contact groupon to get my money back to purchase another if this happens to you group on is wonderful they will do what it is you want they will even contact tough lotus if you want .
0,"I pay about $126/month for high speed internet, contour 6 HD cable with HBO, and a phone line that I don't use (only bc it would've been the same price if I got everything a la cart. When I ordered the service I definite spoke to a really good hustler.\n\nPros- Internet is amazingly quick. Contour is a great feature but $$$.\n\nCons- I am trying to watch my DVR'ed shows and getting this \""Technical Difficulty\"" message. I would rather not have to call to reset my box. This happens fairly often. Also, sometimes my TV shows get cut off at the end so I've gotten in the habit of extending the recording 5 mins past just to be sure. There have been times also where my shows just did not properly record. Searching for TV shows is a nuisance (having to type each show title) and going through window after window in order to set multiple show recordings or delete the show from the list. \n\nWhen I lived in San Diego I much preferred AT&T but unfortunately they do not service Las Vegas. The features they had of being able to reset your box via your computer, record options at 2 presses of a button, and just have a system that is more user friendly was just more convenient and less annoying. It was also much much more inexpensive."
0,"This was my first experience  two nights ago.  The food was a mixed experience and I won't be back.  To be fair, as the server recommended, the brisket was their best offering and it was very good but the ribs were tasteless.  The portions were a fair value.  There were only two BBQ sauces and one was an Asian-oriented sauce unusual for this food and the other was at best like a slug of molasses.  \n\nHowever, a dining experience is more than the food even if the setting is a casual environment.  The attitude toward the customer starts with the owner/manager and the staff essentially follow it.  My order came back wrong.  The server did correct the problem when I pointed it out.  At the end of the meal, the server inquired about my interest in desert.  Since it was my first experience there and my initial order came back wrong, I inquired if management would cover the cost of desert as a gesture of service courtesy.  The server went to the owner/manager who didn't both to come over and talk with me and said they would give me only half a desert but charge me half the price. This approach obviously won't win any loyalty from me nor likely from anyone else.  I spent over $33 on my meal alone, before gratuity, and didn't merit a visit from the owner/manager when the restaurant had only a few diners."
0,"This seems to be a place you either love or really dislike. They were quite busy for a sunday night at 8pm so they do have some fans, however, this place is not for me.\n\nPros\nTurkey was good with the bbq sauce\n\nBeef brisket was well cooked although to smokey almost a lighter fluid taste\n\nCole slaw is simple fresh and tasty.\n\nCons\n\nPork ribs were undercooked in my opinion.\nSent them back.\n\nJalepeno suasage was dry.\n\nThe ordering and dining concept is terrible.\nThere are no plates, you eat your meal on a less than \npaper thin piece of wax paper. So once the juice and grease from your food soaks into the paper...your food is essentially sitting in direct contact with the table. Seems unsanitary and Its a mess. \n\nOverpriced."
0,"So I usually do not write a review unless I have something nice to say, but I'd like to corroborate all of the negative comments on here by agreeing that Cafe Boa made a wrong turn somewhere.  For years I ate here about once a month; I found the food to be delicious and for the most part the service was always decent.  I was surprised to see that they had completely changed their menu, and I was willing to give it a try, I had faith.  The overpriced pasta I had was tasty, but I was certainly still very hungry after finishing it.  I understand that pasta is traditionally a mid-course in many fine dining restaurants, and that it is not always large in size, but after serving hearty portions of pasta for years and years, to completely change your concept by giving us less food for more money seems pretty unintelligent, especially in an economic slump.  I have also noticed that the service has slipped here, once enthusiastic and unique, everyone seems kind of sad to be there.  Maybe I'll return someday.."

0,Please don't stay at this Casino. This place smell so bad you won't able to stand it.\nI don't care if the room is free it's still not worth it.

The only things that is good about this place is the Valet parking I  would give them 5 stars for that.

0,I've been here a few times and every time my experience was very different.  \n\nThe first time we went late on a Friday night as a friend knew that local musicians get together in the bottom bar to have a jamming session after they have finished playing at other pubs and venues.  This was a great night and I'd give it 5 stars.  SO much fun and we even got to have a wee shot on the guitars!!!  \n\nThe second time I went in for a quick drink in the top bar which is not the most classy of venues.  Rammed in there at 7pm on a Friday night beside older locals was not a nice experience.  If I could give zero stars then that would even be too much!!!  \n\nI still couldn't get the memory of that first night out of my head so on the third occassion I had visitors over from foreign lands.  I wanted to give them a taste of Scotland so decided to take them along in the hope that the musicians would be back.  There were musicians but in the bar upstairs.  They played their own local songs with lots of slang words so of course my friends didn't have a clue what they were on about.  When I requested that they play 'Caledonia' I got laughed at and if looks could kill then I'd have been lying in a pool of blood in the middle of the floor!!!  \n\nI've now come to the conclusion that every night is different and you have to just appreciate the memories.  I doubt I'll be giving this place another chance.
1,This place was awesome. Everyone we encountered was so friendly and nice. The train ride was very informative with history. Will do this every time I come to Las Vegas.
1,"This place never disappoints. Ask for a table on the strip patio. Worth the wait! Oh now I love to watch the crazy drive by while shipping a French martini. Goat cheese appie is delish! Have had several items here, all good. Very good burgers. Strong pours in drinks and wonderful service. Great spot for lunch or a quick appetizer and drink while walking the strip!"
1,"I first went here for their Thanksgiving brunch. It was delicious. They had all of your basic Thanksgiving food with a fine dining twist. On my hubby and my two year anniversary, we decided to go back since we loved it so much. They did not disappoint! We started out with the braised bacon as an appetizer. It was delicious, and the maple grits it sat on top of were the best part. Then we had the compass bisque. It is a roasted eggplant puree that has lump crab meat in it. It is a must try, even if you don't like eggplant. They had had it during the Thanksgiving brunch, sans the crab meat, but still good all the same. For my entree I had the diver scallops, and they were perfectly cooked and delicious. Then for dessert, we ordered the custard trio. It had creme brulee, a honey date flan, and some sort of chocolate custard. The waitress brought it over with a little chocolate piece that said Happy Anniversary and she even put in a candle in it an sang Happy Anniversary to the tune of Happy Birthday. The fact that you get to rotate and see the entire city while you're dining is an added bonus! I recommend it for any special occasion or whenever you don't mind spending a lot on dinner, since the place is a bit pricy (but worth it!) I would recommend it to anyone!"
1,"Aside from the fantastic decor and hospitable service that my party of 30 received, I want to give a special shout out to the mac and cheese on this menu.  \n\nI know, I know, it's a steak joint so they obviously provide superb steaks.  But their truffle mac and cheese is like nothing I've ever tasted before- and I am not a mushroom girl.  The truffle flavor is just subtle enough that the addition is truly an enhancement.  It was by far the best mac and cheese I've ever tasted (sorry mom).  And well worth the exhorbitant price that was paid for it."
0,"Fellow Las Vegans if you EVER need service on your auto please do yourself a HUGE favor and DO NOT TAKE your car to Ted Wiens Tire & Auto on Warm Springs and Eastern. We took our car there .. it was supposed to take them 3hrs to repair. We now its 24 hrs plus into a 3 hrs repair . Because they broken a critical part putting it back together and had to ship it overnight to fix, then has stalled at repairing it was supposed to be complete at 10am and its 1pm now. So do yourself  favor AVOID like the Plague Ted Wiens Tire & Auto on Warm Springs and Eastern."
1,"I had need of a tow the other day, and my insurance company called this company. The time was set for them to be at my location at 09:15. I called to verify as per my insurance and was told yep!. I was also sent a text verifying as well as giving me the position of the wrecker, which showed on the map, about 5 miles from my location. To make a long story short, the tow arrived 1 hour later, and up until I called and asked what was going on, the wrecker that I saw on the map never moved... Beware of tracking devices in your vehicles!  Anyway I got my vehicle towed, the driver \""Charlie\"" was courteous, and friendly... Yea I'd use them again....."
1,"If I was simply reviewing the service & food I would be at around 2 stars.....it's not that great.  But why 4 stars you ask? Karaoke my friend, if you haven't been to The Grapevine on a Saturday night for Karaoke you are missing out.  I thoroughly embarrassed my self last weekend and I suggest you do the same."
1,"Most people who stay at the MGM will get to eat here free, or at least at a discounted price.  I didn't, but I was still thoroughly impressed with this buffet.  The quality is not the best, but they served all the food I like.  I like typical food that a 12 year old likes lol.  Like pasta dishes, and hamburgers etc.  This place was it.  Really stuffed myself here =)\n\nDerek"
0,"Appeal:\nOpen 24/7\nWalkable distance from work\nFriendly staff\n\nI know, there should be more than that on the appeals side, since this is a place that serves food. I've been here on two occasions: one was a pickup for lunch, and the other was a going out to lunch. Both times, the prices were reasonable, and the staff was friendly and attentive. Food... not so impressive.\n\nFor my to-go order, I got a BLT with fries. I like a lot of veggies on my sandwiches more than the average person, but there were huge hunks of shredded lettuce on this sandwich. I had to take half of it off. There was barely any mayo, and what there was of it was scraped thinly across very, very dry wheat bread. Nor was it cut, which might seem like a moot point, but this thing was stuffed to the gills with lettuce, and would have been easier to eat. The fries were average.\n\nMy dining-in order was when I went with some co-workers for lunch. I decided to go with the Greek salad. I know, not your typical diner choice, but if you're going to put something on a menu, make sure you can make it well. \nThe salad was so soaked with dressing that towards the end I couldn't even finish it because everything was so saturated. Mostly lettuce and black olives (which are not good on a Greek salad, though they might someday find that Greek olives are), and a small smattering of bland feta. The high point was that it was served with some kind of weird sugary bread with cheese melted on it that was actually very tasty, but sadly, the best part of the meal.\nMy co-workers almost all go burgers, saying that they were excited to try the diner's hand-cut french fries. When I had had the fries with my BLT, they had just tasted like regular fries, nothing crazy special. \nAll of their burgers are cooked to medium-well, so I'm assuming that they come frozen. Another collegue got the fried fish lunch, but didn't feel well after.\nMost hilarious of all was the drink situation. It didn't really effect me since I got water, but everyone else except one person got sodas. First and up to the third time around, they were still all flat. Each time they brought new drinks, they said that the Co2 had been fixed, but it ended up never being fixed and they all ended up getting sweet teas instead. \n\nAll in all... definitely have had better at diners elsewhere. No doubt people will want to go back for lunch again and I'll trudge along, so keep posted for a hopefully more positive review next time around. \n\nOn a saving note, everyone that I've talked to says that they have really good breakfast food. Maybe I'll try that avenue next time."
1,"Searching desperately for a Mexican restaurant that stayed open a little later than 9pm on the night of my friend's dad's birthday, we settled on Bonito Michoacan.\n\nWhat we received was extremely friendly service, a lot of delicious food, and they had like a 4 piece band sing happy birthday and gave our man of the hour a free shot of tequila.\n\nI don't really see anything I could have criticized from our experience. We were seated promptly, treated well, and the food was surprisingly very delicious. Additionally, we stayed there for a good 40 minutes after their closing time and never felt rushed at all.\n\nI had the steak cilantro, whilst the others around the table had an assortment of chimichanga, a crazy gigantic burrito, and chicken helena or something along those lines. Everything was cooked really well with rich strong flavors.\n\nWe also got the hand-made table side guacamole and it was extremely tasty and fresh.\n\nAll in all it was a very pleasant experience."
0,Lines here are so long. The manager Brad sometimes just seems not present. Nice guy... Come on trader joes get present to these lame lines.
0,Basically a glorified all you can eat buffet. I think they try to overwhelm you with so much food so that you don't realize that it's all pretty mediocre.\n\nZero ambiance.\n\nHope you like meat.
0,"So I ordered the Nathan sliders as an appetizer. The menu specifically states that you get 6 mini hotdogs with your choice of topping. It lists cheese, relish, mustard and a few other things. I asked our server if it was nacho cheese or shredded cheese. She said either or. As I go to pay the tab says $1.99 for cheese added to our hotdogs. I explain to the check out lady that it was a mistake the menu says includes. She then has to go speak to her manager. She comes back and tells me she cannot remove it, it included a shredded cheese not a nacho cheese. Not only does the menu not state what type of cheese but the server didn't even specify. Most would just roll over because it's only $2 but I was in a feisty mood so I continued to argue. Finally a manager comes over and TELLS me not explains to me why it's an up charge. I TELL her back that it is crap they should be specific and our server said it was fine. 10 minutes later she took the sliders off all together. I wasn't asking for that just the $2 so that is why they get a 1 star. After all that I go to pay and she asks me how everything was....... \""Actually it wasn't even that good\"" was my answer. So more importantly don't eat here because the food is basically terrible."
1,This is by far best place for chicken and oxtails.  Great food and customer service. Better than lo Lo chicken and waffles
1,"Hmmm...I thought I reviewed Jet. I never had a problem going in....or a problem at the bar. Given it's one of my properties and also one of my former students works here. There are a couple things though. Jet is part of Light Group - they require the bartenders to have a guest list certain nights. If you're looking to get in and bypass the line - go ahead and leave me a message and I'll push you and your party through. Hopefully it's more girls than guys. The club itself is pretty dark - when you walk into the main area. There's a dancefloor - surrounded by bars and vip areas. When it gets crowded, the security likes to move you around like cattle. For one. I am not cattle. DON'T PUSH ME! So overall I like the different rooms. My favorite is the hip hop room. Where I'm not cattle. Sure drinks are expensive but the bartenders are pretty good there. The shot girls are hot. The middle of the main dance floor has an area for the drunk girls to get up and pole dance. Hehe nothin wrong with that. Now if I can only get them to make out with my power of perversion...errr.....persuasion.\nSo knock one star for security's organization and herding people around. Knock another 1/2 for cost of drinks. Knock 1 more half for the mayhem to try to get in. But if you wanna dance...this is defnitely one of the better clubs. Usually good ratio for guys to girls."
1,"Yama is a great off the strip place to visit for lunch. We normally drop in on our way up from the valley. I really like to sit at the sushi bar and banter with the chefs as they make whatever you like. The quality for the price is great, very nice white tuna, great mackerel - It isn't fine dining or what have you but the quality is there.\nI enjoy the seafood salad that they make and my better half likes some of their baked rolls.\n They make one thing in particular that is out of this world, to me at least. Hamachi Kama is so good there. Not fried, just grilled like you don't want to know. One thing to note is that it gets really busy, really fast so sitting at the sushi bar as a couple is great. \nSince May, they expanded and have a U shaped sushi bar and much more seating so it might be a bit better for wait times. It is all you can eat if you want it, and well worth it."
1,"Consistency is important to me and this restaurant is consistent. The employees are friendly and knowledgable, always ready to give suggestions. The food has always been excellent and I can taste each flavor, which is always unique and not just the same old taste you can get anywhere. Some of my favorites at this restaurant is their fresh pasta, meatballs, and I usually get whatever special they have. \n\nThe only meal I've got here that I was not a fan of was their chicken Marsala. It had a heavy thick glaze with a strong unfamiliar taste. It's not the Marsala I'm used to. I wouldn't order that again. 5 stars because everything else has been so delicious.\n\nI would love to try one of their special tasting menus."
1,"The food and service are good just that a couple of weeks ago during that freak cold spell, the one waitress kept leaving the door open to the outside patio-----------brrrr! \n\nThough I'd definitely go back there to eat."
0,There is a reason why they are located elsewhere from all the other rental companies. There is a reason for the seedy office. Save yourself the time and hassle.
0,"My son purchased a trek 850 from Jones, cost for bike with tax and accessories, bike lock, lights was $475. He purchased it with his own money that he saved from working after school, to buy a Last week I was running and he was biking. He went over a curb and the weld that makes the wheel round the wheel broke, and the wheel bent over. He brought the bike to the Jones shop. They told him that someone must have run the bike over and that is why the wheel is broke. My son called me and I went down to the shop and asked Travis Jones (the owner) to please show where the bike was run over. After him examining the bike he could not find a mark or any indication that this had happened. (Which it didn't) He told me and my son that the only parts of the trek bike that had a warranty was the frame. Every other part was warranted by the maker of the components and that the wheels had no warranty. He agreed to put in a claim and could call me back on Tuesday or maybe Wednesday at the latest. Today,, I still had not received a call back so I decide to give him a call, He didn't answer so I left a message. He called back 45 minutes later. He acted as though he had no Idea who I was. Finally he said he had not checked on the warranty yet. (So he basically ignored the fact that I was even in the store and didn't follow up with me regarding this issue) He checked while I was on the phone and told me that trek would not warranty this part. He went on to tell me that there was no warranty on the bike again and Jones would not be taking care of this part. Mind you it is a 40 dollar retail part (probable cost to dealer $15). I asked for a phone number to Trek and he told me there was no phone number to call and that I could only email them for help with this. I asked for his sales rep phone number and he refused. Again telling me that the only thing on the bike that was warranted from trek was the frame. Everything else was warranted through the manufacturer of the components and not through trek, and the wheels had 0 warranty. If it broke before we took delivery he would have to eat the repair, but if it broke on the way to the car in the parking lot or the next day, it was our (the customer) responsibility. The manufactures warranty clearly states that these items are covered although not for the lifetime. The components with the shortest warranty are 1 year and that is for the paint and decals. So he is clearly not telling the truth and is not interested in customer service. I would strongly recommend choosing a bike shop other that Jones for purchasing a bike. WE could have paid less and had the bike shipped to us, but we choose to support out local business, but clearly they choose not to support the local customers. Like I said Beware of shops like 2 Week Jones, they say they are about customer service and their warranty, but their actions do not match their words. Beware, $20 dollar tune-ups are nothing compared to having a bike that the bakeshop will not stand behind. Actions speak much louder than words. Stay Away."
1,"Had the eggs benedict and cheese grits. \n\nBoth were good, but nothing out of the ordinary... \n\nI particularly liked that they had donut holes from Dunkin Donuts along with coffee in the waiting area....\n\nWhile we didnt have to wait long, I definitely filled up on SEVERAL of the cinnamon, powdered sugar donut holes."
1,"I would give them more stars if I could.   I had other company out here who charged way too much and then wanted another $550 to remove the hive.   I was lucky enough to call Queen B and am thrilled.   The came out immediately, put in a pest strip, said there was no \""hive\"" and all for a reasonable price.   Please pass the name of Queen Bee on to your friends because they are honest, reliable, and reasonable."
0,"Well I wish I could say the rest of the reviews here about the delivery experience were incorrect but unfortunately they're not. My store experience with Barbara Walters, yes that's her name, as my sales person she was absolutely wonderful and patient as my husband and I shopped for over 3 hours. In the end I purchased over $7000 of furniture at the Scottsdale location.\n\nMy delivery window today Sunday was from 12 to 6 PM. At 9 AM I received a call from the delivery driver to let me know he was ahead of schedule and would be at the house in 45 minutes to an hour. I was actually okay with this because I'm a huge Chicago fan and the bears are playing the Packers today which for anybody who knows anything about football is a huge deal. With the new delivery time I would miss maybe half the first quarter, that I can handle. So I rushed out of my current home to my New home where the furniture is to be delivered to meet the driver. Well it's now noon and still no driver.\n\nI believe living spaces outsources their furniture delivery. They should seriously consider bringing this in-house even at a higher cost. Because of this experience I will not purchase any more furniture from living spaces. I have a large line of credit and a nearly empty home so this is a loss for them.\n\nThe quickest way to piss off a Chicagoan is to cause them to wait for hours in a home with no television during a Bears Packers game. Once my furniture arrives  I will update the review if I feel any differently. Considering it's now noon and I was called almost 3 hours ago I highly doubt anything will change unless this guy shows up with an iPad with 4G and the game on SundayTicket already streaming."
0,"OK, so there's nothing horribly bad or incredibly wonderful about this airport, but the restroom attendants are totally creepy.  They're also unnecessary--there are plenty of airports that don't have creepy attendants and which have pristine restrooms.  The last thing I want in a public bathroom is some overly enthusiastic dude getting all up in my grill wishing me a wonderful day and trying to push paper towels into my hand.  The obnoxious obviousness for tips is annoying as well.  Why should I help subsidize the salary of an airport employee just because I took a whiz?  Get rid of these dookie denizens so people can do their business in peace and not get hit up for cash."
0,"The food and atmosphere are great! Urban and chic. We went on a Sunday for brunch and had the scrambled eggs and the chocolate pancake.\nHowever, what put a damper on the whole experience was the service. We waited for 20 min for our check after asking for it and our bill was incorrect.  I was warned about SLOWWWWWWWW service in AZ. and now I have lived it."
1,"Cool little place I discovered while I was opening an account at PNC Bank that is across the street. Food is really good and the prices are unbeatable. The panini's are great and the wraps are not half bad either. I got way more than what I paid for and felt like it was a great value.\n\nI spoke with the owner who was behind the counter and he seems like a very nice guy. The guy in front of me in line apparently had his order messed up and the owner was kind enough to fix it and give it to him free of charge. Cool little local place and a great way to support local businesses. \n\nThey have no seating. The owner told me when he bought the building, the Crazy Mocha coffee shop that is next door bought the bathrooms so because of health codes, he is not allowed to have seating. TAKE OUT ONLY!!"
0,"ok so on the 19th i posted a review and my biggest gripe was the nickle & dime practices of the managment.  Well today i got my move-out bill.  You see, when i paid my rent on the first of the month, i thought that at the end of the month when i moved out i would all paid up.  Apparently not.  \n\n3 dirty ceiling fans,stove top,oven,microwave,sink,cabinet,shower/tub 127.50\nCarpet Clean 55.00\nCarpet Clean - Tax 1.10\nDirty bathroom sink 15.00\nWater - $15\nSewer - $8.54\nTrash - $9\nGas - $9\nElectric - $27\nTax - $1.61\nService Fee (?) - $3.40\n\nTotal - $272.15\n\nThere was absolutely NO damage with my apt when i left.  I am being charged for general cleaning that would need to be done prior to any tenant leaving and a new tenant moving in.\n\nBut thats not the worst of it.  I got charged $197 for cleaning (the rest is for utilities). In fact it could have been much worse.  It could have been $250 JUST FOR CLEANING.  And according to the lease, I actually agreed to this.  \n\nAdditionally, the office suggested i do a walk-thru inspection prior to my moving out.  So i said, well i'm moving out on the 30th, so it can be anytime between now and the 30th.  I was told well you have to been completely moved out prior to the walk-thru, so i suggested that we do it on the 31st.  I was told then i would be charged and extra day.  So i said how about late in the day on the 30th?  Well the guy leaves at 3pm, and it was unlikely that we would be completely out by 3pm.\n\nSo basically, if you are gonna avoid any cleaning charges, AND would like to do a final walk-thru, you need to move out in time for A) to have the apartment professionally cleaned B) have the carpets professionally cleaned , and C) do a final walk-thru.  So be sure your out a good 5 days prior to your actual move out date.\n\nReview your lease CAREFULLY prior to renting w/ Greystar, and their Capri on Camelback property."
1,"Pallet, Local Breeze, and now The Vig Fillmore.  I hope it is a done deal.  I always loved their open spacious patio.  I arrived for a birthday dinner.  They have an amazing Happy Hour so took advantage of that. The $5 flatbread pizza with goat cheese was so delicious."
1,"Wish I can go back here...\n\nTheir menu as other yelpers have suggested is extensive. I was a bit weary about having non-Japanese food so stuck to good 'ol chicken katsu. For 10 bucks, you get miso soup, all white meat chicken perfectly fried (light and not greasy), and a side salad. Oh yeah, the bread basket with slices of banana bread, dinner roll, and cinnamon sugared crostinis were soooo delish! I was actually full by the time my meal arrived but didn't want to be rude and begrudgingly ate my meal (in perfect bliss). I went at 11:30 and was out by 12:30 without feeling rushed or not attended to. My waitress told me to take the bill to the cashier if I was in a hurry.\n\nI was very happy with my meal and service and would love to go back for some Italian grub...will have to convince boss to send me to Phoenix again :)"
0,"Maybe the blandest and most unappetizing Mom and Pop Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten at.\n\nI had the displeasure of trying this place once during lunch for work, and once for dinner before a Suns game. Both times they offered cheap combination platters that ran about 7 dollars for an entree, soup, fried rice, and egg roll. Everything from there I would probably rank a step or two below what you even get at a Panda Express.\n\nThe Ma po tofu dish I picked last time for dinner was particularly awful and bland. Some cheap store bought tofu lightly fried with some soy sauce. If it wasn't enough, I got somewhat sick off of it too. How do you poison someone with a tofu dish? I guess this place is good at sucking every way possible.\n\nAt least its cheap."
1,Love their lunch sandwiches on the patio.  I had the cubana which was extremely tasty but a lot of sandwich so make sure your hungry.  I also tried their mufeleta......which i my favorite.
0,"I had a terrible experience with OBGYN Specialists. I called in September for an appointment and was told that they only see new patients every so often. I made an appointment with Dr. Reynolds for DECEMBER 8. That's 3 months that I had to wait the for very next available appointment.\n\nThen, on December 4 I get a call saying they had to schedule a surgery during my appointment and that we'd need to reschedule. They then proceed to start telling me available times in FEBRUARY. Ridiculous and SO rude. The doctors might be good but the wait and rudeness I was treated with is so not worth your time and money."
0,"Only 1 Star based upon my review of the PHO\n\ni've had great Pho over the years, this is not one of them. I wanted a Large bowl of what i'm used to, loaded with beef, tendon, brisket -- the usual house special etc. this is usually provided at every great Pho eatery in and out of the States. \nYesterday I ventured into this place while traveling and dialed it up from my Android, and there were several choices in Surprise AZ, I chose the first one at the top of the page...due to alphabetical order etc. Anyway I ordered the house special, which was brisket, meatball, tendon,  etc. The sizes here are small and large only... The small bowl is 8 dollars, and the large is 9 dollars, I thought that the prices were pretty steep, I thought the quality better match the price. \n\nWhen my bowl of Pho came to the table,  the large here looked like a small in my other experiences with \""great Pho eateries\"", with that said this is NOT a \""great Pho eatery\"" I'll get to that later...\n\nAnyway I thought this must be good, for nearly 10 bucks for a bowl of Pho which I have never paid that much before. The broth was very bland and tasted like it needed more beef flavor, spices etc.  I had to add everything to it to make it have any taste, usually this is the test of any Pho restaurant is the Pho base, the base is the \""money maker\""  if the base is good usually everything else is good. Also, The Pho had very little meat, I couldn't believe that I paid 10 dollars for just a few slices of beef, the meatball was tough and had no flavor and less than to be desired, \n\nNeedless to say I will never visit this place again. I felt robbed, and felt that I could have spent my money elsewhere...There are too many other great Pho places to eat at unless they improved their product, increase value & lower their prices, I will never go back....\n\nSaigon Kitchen - You get 1 Star.... your Pho failed Big Time!"
1,"The steaks at Arrowhead Grill are top notch! Celebrating our 5 year anniversary with family, the service was great and the food was filling and well worth it. I liked the family style sides which were all pretty good such as green beans, truffle cauliflower and grilled artichokes. I had a 8oz filet Mignon, it was buttery and spiced well, and a nice glass of red wine.  Yum! I would definitely go back!"
0,"Our group got hungry so with the lack of planning, we decided to just go across the street to Johnny Rockets.\n\nFOOD - 1 Star: I ordered:\n\n- Chili Cheese Fries: These were ok. They were really heavy on the chili and the cheese was barely there. It would've been way better to actually have the cheese on the top instead of under the chili.\n\n- Sweet Potato Bacon Cheese Fries: I enjoyed the sweet potato fries myself, but the cheese... if you can call it that... was pretty disgusting. I don't know why they couldn't use real cheese. Instead they used some liquid cheese that you'd find at the movie theater and so it had this weird taste to it. The only thing that kind of saved it was the bacon, but even that was overpowered by the liquid cheese. This ruined my appetite and I had to eat around the cheese, which was almost impossible since it was all over the place.\n\n- Smoke House Single Burger: This was pretty good, but smaller than I thought it would be. Maybe I don't come here often enough, but the burger was small. The taste was spot on. You can't go wrong with a meat patty, cheese, onion rings, and bacon.\n\nSERVICE - 2 Stars: The staff was friendly, but literally only approached us to drop off the menus and to deliver food. No one checked on us at all during the meal. I need an extra fork and literally had to flag someone down to get it.\n\nATMOSPHERE - 2 Stars: It's your typical Johnny Rocket's setup and my biggest issue with the place was the fact there was no soap in the restroom. I'm glad we had hand sanitizer with us, but that's just gross.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Overall, I'd say you can skip this place. Go to Capriotti's or Joe's Pizza in the same shopping center instead. You'll get way better food for the money you're paying."
0,So dissapointed by this new location of the family owned Stacy's.  The Sauce was literally an icky uber sweet  mess. The price was quite high for a small portions of  medioacre bbq. T\nPreviously I have love Stacy's on Indian School. but this is not the same!
1,"First off, try the kimchi!\n\nI'd give Hodori five stars, because the food is really great. What ruined it for me was the service. The server, whose name escapes me, was very short with us; maybe it was an off day, but I don't know if that's really a valid reason. We're not a very demanding party of two, so we were a bit thrown off.\n\nDespite that minor setback, the bbq chicken and bbq ribs were take-home-for-leftovers worthy. Which is good, because you definitely pay for your portion. Go during lunch, which I believe ends at 3. Half-price meals, which still totals about $12 a person!"
0,"would not recommend this salon.  I came here with a friend for a mani/pedi.  We walked in with no appt. but then four other people came in after us.  They owners told them to wait and then worked so fast on my nails that 1) they didn't remove the clear polish on my nails from my previous manicure 2) tore my cuticles by hanking them bc they were going so fast and 3) the paint on my nails is all down in the cuticles,  it looks really bad.\n\nThere is not a good selection of nail polish and they add \""thinner\"" to it because it so old and thickened.  \n\nFor $33 mani/pedi I would definitely suggest you go somewhere else."
1,"This place is great to check out anytime of year!!! It's always so beautiful and amazing w/ what they have on display each time I come here.  The last time I was here was in October and they had a really cute display for Autumn...a nice little bridge that goes through the greenery and water fountains that shoot up and over the bridge as you're walking through...& a GIANT bucket of bright green, red and yellow apples flowing from it! It was amazing!!! (check out the pix i posted!)\n\nIt's a great spot for photos especially during the holidays and the greatest part about it is that it's FREE!!! =)"
0,"Like much in Vegas, pretty on the outside, but no substance.\n\nAte here twice on a recent business trip. The space, redecorated from its previous goofy pseudo-diner style, is quite nice, masculine and casual yet well-appointed, with a classy bar and the now-ubiquitious but still pretty old style light bulbs. Sat at the bar and had friendly and attentive service. \n\nThe breakfast was standard - eggs/toast/sausage/potatoes were like \""diner plus\"" with a flavorful pepper mixed in with the potatoes and thick texas style toast. Fine. The major disappointment was dinner. I went in craving something just barely healthy (after a few days in Vegas I was desperate for a vegetable) and the main recommended entree at Citizens is a chicken/brocolli/potato plate that looked great. Unfortunately the execution was inexcusably poor, especially for a \""signature\"" dish. The chicken was flavorless and dry, even with the skin left on. Broccoli rabe was undercooked and also flavorless, and the potato quarters were the least cooked of all, with a full half of them too hard to even cut with a fork, and inedible. Everything sat in a plate full of broth, perhaps that's in an attempt to disguize the dryness and blandless of the food, but even the broth doesn't help. Chow in San Francisco does this chicken/brussel sprouts/mashed potato dish that's just bursting with flavor and juiciness, and it's like 12 bucks. This $25 plate was just sad and pointless. Again, like so much in Vegas in general, it's an opportunity to spend twice as much on something half as good."
0,"B\u00fazios has been on my to try list for quite some time.  When I saw a Groupon for it, I bought one and planned to have dinner here on the night I was going to see Penn & Teller at the Rio.\n\nI had a reservation for 6:30 and I was promptly seated in an almost empty restaurant.  There was one table occupied and one person eating at the seafood bar.  I had looked at the menu online, but I took some time looking there, changing my mind, and then ordering.  I was brought a bread basket, served water, and brought an iced tea quickly.\n\nI ordered a jumbo lump crabmeat cocktail, the miso Chilean sea bass, and the 7 layer chocolate cake for dessert.  The lump crabmeat was the best part of the meal.  The crab was tasty and the cocktail sauce they brought had extra horseradish to mix in.  I really enjoyed this appetizer.\n\nThe sea bass was disappointing.  It was on the menu under their \""House Signatures\"" section of the menu.  It's described as sea bass with a house made miso glaze.  What I got was more of a miso gravy than glaze and it wasn't appealing.  When I tasted it, I wished I had ordered the plain sea bass.  The sea bass was moist and very hot (temperature).  The entr\u00e9e comes with two sides and I chose cole slaw and garlic fries.  The fires were good but they had absolutely no taste of garlic.  The cole slaw was OK.\n\nWhen it came to dessert, I had asked my server if the cobbler was warmed.  He said yes.  I asked him if it was already warm and he said no.  I ordered the cobbler and asked that it not be warmed.  About 3 minutes later, he came back and said they ran out of cobbler.  I opted for the 7 layer chocolate cake.  I wonder if they really were out or if the cobbler was indeed kept warm and he didn't want to tell me that.\n\nService was spotty during the night.  Empty Sweet 'n Low packets were not removed from the table until I put them in the empty crab cocktail glass.  Iced tea wasn't refilled as quickly as many restaurants of lesser cost, and the table was not properly bussed.  The waiter didn't remove the bread basket and bread plate before he brought the dessert.  After I had taken a few bites of the cake, a bus person came by and removed those items.\n\nAnd then there's the Groupon.  The fine print says not valid with any other..... including Total Rewards.  That means, they don't give you the TR pricing.  It's not that much of a loss to the customer and it shouldn't be that big of a deal for B\u00fazios either.  $1 more for the appetizer, $3 more for the sea bass, and $1 more for dessert.  You got $5 more out of me for using a Groupon.  Was it worth it to you?  Also, the Groupon states that an 18% service fee (note they can't say gratuity anymore because of IRS rules) will be applied to the bill prior to discount.  I somewhat understand this, but my server got cheated a bit because I normally do 20%.  Not that much difference but hey, I'm getting back part of the TR pricing I couldn't have.  \n\nFinally, reservations were made through Open Table.  At any other restaurant, as soon as I check in, Open Table says I have 100 points.  As of this afternoon, my Open Table points are \""pending\"".\n\nThis apparently is the way B\u00fazios operates.  Don't be business friendly with the customer.  Instead, challenge them and nickel and dime them every step of the way.  Groupons normally are sold by new companies to drive traffic and make a name.  The other reason is to help failing places.  Since the B\u00fazios Groupon is an ongoing seller, I can only imagine that they're struggling to stay alive.\n\nWhat a mistake it was to come here!"
1,My husband and I tried this restaurant last night and I must admit I was not disappointed.  The waiter was friendly and helpful and the food was amazing.  My husband had the goulash which was just delicious and I had the chicken kiev which was the best I had ever had.  The little potato dumplings that came with the kiev simply melted in the mouth.  The plates were stunning and colorful with different slaws and fresh vegetables.  Service was a little slower than what we are used to but patience is rewarded with an amazing dinner.  We will definately be going back.
0,"Been to the Biltmore location many times but my wedge salad was drowning in dressing, the food took WAY too long to come out and I took a bite of my son's burger and almost had to spit it out. The banana cream pie was great but that graham cracker crust needs a hammer & chisel to get through.\nLove the wide open location!\nOverall, much too pricey for what you (don't ) get."
1,"Amazing time with the hubby tonight at Andrea's. They even had my name on my chopsticks! Great food, drinks and service. And you have to get the mochi ice cream and cheese cake bites for dessert, wonderful way to finish the night."
1,"My significant other wanted me to go to a Cirque du Soleil show.  The Cirque shows at the MGM and other places were $80+ for terrible seats.  I suggested Zumanity because the tickets were a lot cheaper and the venue was a lot smaller.  The front desk at our hotel (MGM) gave us a free booklet with a list of shows and things to see in Vegas.  There was a coupon inside for Zumanity buy one ticket get another for $10.  We ended up getting tickets for the third row at the box office in New York, New York. \n\nWe knew it was an \""adult\"" show, but I didn't know what to expect besides some frontal nudity.  It is definitely not a show to take your parents to see (although I did see a mom and adult son).  There are a number of sexual and topless aspects of the show.  The MC is a drag queen and he was great and hilarious.  The show has great humor, jokes, audience interaction, and there is something for most sexual preferences and desires.  There are some gay and lesbian aspects - this may be off putting to some people - my view is what ever floats your boat.  Even if the main scene was not your thing (gay, midgets, cross dressers), there were usually people in the background doing something.  So even if the concept of a three way with one girl and two guys is not interesting to you... you can check out the topless girl dancing in the background.\n\nThere are some acrobats in the show, but the main focus is on sexual themes.  The crowd was a great mix of people: old, young, hetero, homo, foreign, and interracial couples.  Minor comment: the female performers are (mostly) in great shape so they are a little low on the cup size."
1,"I'm not a huge ice cream fan. However, mix it up with some booze, and you're talking a totally different game!\n\nI was first introduced to Lee and her liquor-ific confections at the Phoenix New Time Gala Event (or whatever it was called) a few months back. It was a huge hit, and the ladies I was with couldn't get enough!\n\nFast forward to this weekend, and one of those ladies (who looks very much like my mother) came back to down with three friends in tow. They asked about Lee's and I found that she had just opened her shop. Were I not a devout skeptic, I'd claim divine intervention!\n\nThrough the course of the weekend, we took two different trips, for the gals couldn't get enough! And truth be told, I was mighty impressed myself.\n\nAs other reviewers have said this is ice CREAM. Very creamy. The booze isn't overpowering, either. It's a nice addition, so you don't have to worry about an open flame. And yes, Lee even serves up non-alcoholic flavors for those who don't partake. I assume those are good. Not like I tried any.\n\nWe'll be back. Lots. It's hot out there! Adult ice cream, FTW!"
1,Backyard Taco was serving at the Johnson Elementary Carnival. The food was fantastic and grilled right before us. Really enjoyed the carne asada and pollo street tacos. Everyone was raving about their food. One parent was raving about her papa loca. NICE!
0,"UPDATED REVIEW\n\nWow, what happened,??? I gave SHe a 5-star rating back in Jan. but when I returned last week things were VERY different. The place was nearly empty, there were no more \""entertainers\""  and no more DJ performing in the dining room. Now SHe is just another steakhouse on the strip no different than the dozen plus other steakhouses within a mile or two radius of SHe. Food was still good but definately nothing to draw me back ever again. When I asked about the entertainers they said they were \""going a different direction\""....makes no sense to me, the entertainers were the draw. Sorry to say I will probably not be returning unless they go back to their old ways. Somebody really missed the target on this one."
0,"Houston's we got a problem!!! What happened to this place.  In days past the menu was plentiful, the food was great and prices were reasonable.  This no longer exists.  I don't know how on earth this place can survive.  The food was terrible, some too cold, some just plain old bad! The wait staff to interested in turning a table, when in fact it wasn't even crowded, literally interupted a conversation taking place between two of my guests to ask if we wanted dessert. Have you no home training???\n\nFrankly if I could give no stars I would do that.  Wake up a smell the competition or you will be out of business in the blink of an eye."
1,"So, I've lived in Vegas for nearly 12 years now and I always wanted to visit the original Charleston Antique Mall location upon passing. It's been one of those places that I've made a mental note of wanting to visit for the past 12 years and finally after they relocated, I am finally able to check it off my list.\n\nLet me start off by saying I loooove antique shops. I'm one of those people that can pick up an antique item and formulate a history of who the item belonged to, what their life was like, and what the item meant to them. Yeah, I'm a bit strange. I often enter antique shops and feel an eerie sense of haunting and paranormal attachment. However, in the Charleston Antique Mall, I didn't quite feel that (which is a good thing). It could also be the fact that my inner self was well aware of the fact that the current location is what used to be a Peter Piper Pizza aka TONS O' FUN! \n\nI personally enjoyed walking through the Mall. They have it broken up into many different sections which makes for an experience like walking through an antique museum. They seem to have arranged items according to certain themes, which I loved. Looking at the prices of many of the items, they seem quite reasonable as well. I easily lost track of time walking through the entire Mall.\n\nAs a huge sports buff, the only thing I wish they had more of was sports related items. I hope to see more in the future--I will be making frequent visits!"
1,"I've only been here once and it was delicious!\n\nI was staying in Vegas and got tired of eating at the casinos so my friend and I drove around looking for a place to eat when we saw a sign for Maggiano's.  He had been to one in LA before so we gave this one a try.  We were seated right away and, being the klutz that I normally am, I spilled my water all over the table.  Our waiter was super nice and friendly and joked around about it (aka he teased me).  He brought us bread right away and when I spilled water on that, he brought us another basket without us having to ask! \n\nI ordered the garlic shrimp linguine and my friend ordered the braised beef canneloni.  We both loved our meals but I think I filled up on bread so I couldn't finish.  We didn't have room in tiny mini fridge in our hotel room so we didn't take home any leftovers; our waiter seemed almost hurt by our almost full plates of food.  I usually don't like creamy sauces but my pasta was very delicious and flavorful and the shrimp was cooked perfectly (I find that with pasta, the shrimp is often overcooked).  \n\nThe decor was excellent and everything looked very clean.  I didn't expect much from a restaurant on the second floor of a mall but it was amazing.  I will definitely try and come back here."
1,AMAZING! incredibly knowledgeable staff.  i got the wine pairings and all were delicious.  overall an amazing experience. it is pricey but worth the splurge.
0,"Meh... at best!\n\nWe were staying at the Palazzo and when I found out about Azure, I definitely wanted to check it out.  I mean going to a \""Day Club\""/Pool Party is part of the Vegas experience, right?\n\nIt was Saturday and the weather was so/so... it was pretty overcast and looked like it may rain.  We weren't charged a cover, but the guy at the front said that if we wanted a chair, there was a drink minimum of $100 per chair.  He let us in free to check it out.\n\nI guess because of the weather, there were maybe only 10-20 people inside the pool area.  The music was good, but very loud.  The \""bar\"" (the only one I saw) was a little kiosk stand.\n\nI didn't get it.  Am I missing something?\n\nWe ended up leaving and hanging out at the pool just outside of the roped-off area.  We heard the same music and there were more people at that pool (probably having the same idea as my husband and I).  We ended up with just a $40 bar tab rather than the $200 it would have been for the two of us.\n\nI guess most people must not be getting a chair a person, but just hang out in the pool?  I don't know... again, I just didn't get it."
0,"High prices. Their \""Waving Margarita\"" came with 0 tequila in it. Find a better place to eat in the airport."
1,"LOVE LOVE.\n\nI stayed here because I got this nice physical piece of old school mail one day with the offer of $300 for 3 nights at Encore. Ridiculous right? I had a great dual queen bed suite with the panoramic view of the strip. Service was very classy and the location is unmatched. \n\nEveryone knows that the places to be right now are XS and Surrender and well, staying at Encore, both these clubs are literally just downstairs. The other perk of being a hotel guest is that you can purchase your admission to the clubs ahead of time (but not discounted) with guaranteed admission. This is incredible crucial if you're a guy. \n\nI am pretty sure I'm going to spoil myself everytime i go back and stay in vegas. Encore for sure. \n\ncheck-in took me a matter of minutes! you can ask for a small fridge brought up to your room for the goods!\n\nHave fun!"
0,"Yuck.  The only reason this place gets 2 stars is that service was good.  \n\nFirst of all they put Thousand Island dressing on EVERY burger they make.  I tell you this because if you order a bacon guacamole cheeseburger like me and assume it won't have it - you would be wrong.  So be sure you say no 1k Island - they will put it on every burger - yuck!  Still, this is not the worst part of the burger.  I swear with the first bite into mine the beef reminded me of my high school cafeteria.  Double yuck.  It was just not good.  \n\nWe did get some cheese fries that weren't bad, but I tell you if I didn't have a few vodka tonics in me I am not sure I could have stomached more than a few bites. It was not a good burger!\n\nThe waitress was friendly and on top of service, the Hawaiian decor was fun and the bathrooms were clean - that is about it.  Skip it."
0,The beers were warm and flat.  The bartender was argumentative when we told him about it.  6 employees working on a Sunday afternoon and I still had to get up and go to the bar to get napkins for my wings since none were brought to me with them.  The place is cold and not inviting at all.  We won't be back.
0,"This company has switched owners, so everything you read below is based on a different restaurant/owner/menu.\n\nThey no longer accept Groupon, because as stated above, they've switched owners.  The menu items listed and shown in the pictures are no longer applicable.\n\nWe originally went to use a Groupon, but stayed to try the place after being told of the ownership change and no longer accepting Groupon...  big mistake.\n\nThe sausage link was actually a hot dog. *ugh* Soft, no flavor... a hot dog.\n\nThe French Dip was lacking and the au jus looked (and tasted) like meat drippings, not au jus.\n\nThe mac & cheese had too much pepper and lacked any flavor, other than the pepper.\n\nWe ordered a grilled cheese off the children's menu (for the kid in our group) and received mac & cheese instead.\n\nThey were offering a Happy Hour special when we got there, a free side with beer purchase.  Ordered beer, but the check didn't reflect the special.  When we mentioned it, they didn't do anything about it, but they did round up when splitting the bill.  The waitress had a Russian accent, so I'm not sure if she didn't understand or just didn't care.\n\nEither way, we wouldn't go back for the food or the service.  Good luck new owners."
0,More sizzle than substance.  Meals were 'heavy'.\nMiss:- The Braised Bison Ribs -recommend a pass\nWin:- The gnocchi - too much oil\nService:- Still learning\nCleanliness:- Good
0,"My friend  and I were craving burgers and staying at the cosmopolitan- the rating on Yelp seemed good and the menu was just my style. However the food ( wish I took pics) was rather disgusting. Well at least mine was. I ordered the turkey burger, comes with sprouts and avocado. But it came with a smear of guacamole that was absorbed into the bottom and top of the bun bun like butter would be; caramelized onions that were mon existent and more like translucent relish and sprouts that were mushed and all cooked into the gross concoction. Just the thought of it makes me sick because the super dry,  salty, grainy( like knuckle pieces)of a thick turkey patty kept me up all night burping it up. Even into the next day did I taste the awful burger. I was super duper sick. Sweating nauseous x10 and just wanted to die kinda sick.\nDo NOT order the turkey burger.\nUnfortunately we had gross food. This is bound to happen at a lot of places ; but it literally made me sick. I have used yelp for years but never gave my two cents. \nSince I lost two days in vegas due to this restaurant ....I had to share:("
0,"As the other reviewer said, this is hit and miss.  With the weather cooler, it can be freezing inside as they seem to continue to run the A/C.  Service is okay, but if you ask for anything special (i.e. no mayo, add cheese), they get it right half the time.  Trash is always overflowing.  Otherwise no better or worse than any other McDonald's."
1,"My older model pool filter had a leak, and it turned out to be fairly complicated. I am very happy with the repair they did, and I love the fact they did not try to up-sell me on replacing the whole system, as the other 3 companies I called were pushing me to do.  All their employees were very knowledgeable and a pleasure to deal with.  Donnie graciously took the time to educate me on a few issues that needed to be taken care of, and all of his suggestions made sense.  Very happy with the job they did."
0,I have tried a few times and I'm honestly not that impressed. I feel it's overpriced and the sushi isn't that great. #stepupyourgame
1,"I'm not a big fan of pho, but this place really impressed me. Usually, I order the #55, and my boyfriend gets one of the soups. We eat here often."
1,"One of my airport \""go-to's\"" as a flight attendant.  I love their sweet tea (it's a traveling splurge), spicy chicken strips and dirty rice...YUM!"
0,Just awful. Terrible room. Beat up furniture. Dirty carpet.  Terrible room. Despite being a non smoking room it smelled of cigarettes.  Font desk gave incorrect check in and room change information.  I will never stay here again.
0,"I also bought a Groupon. I called before the expiration date and they had a full voice mail that said they will discount their services for the amount I paid. What? That isn't a discount. \n\nWhen I emailed the company, they responded but blamed me for waiting too long. The fine print doesn't that services have to be completed by a certain date. I thought it was okay if I scheduled it by the expiration. I was fine with waiting, I just wanted to schedule it and not have to pay full price since I had already purchased the Groupon.\n\nI have requested a refund from Groupon and am carefully researching other companies to do quarterly service for us. These people have to enter your home, so it's not worth it to let someone into your residence who you you have to fight with to get them to do the right thing! \n\nIn the future I will not purchase any service like this from Groupon without thoroughly researching the company first. If there isn't enough information on them to do that, just move on!"
0,"Soggy Texas Toast.  Tough ribs.  Poured on BBQ sauce.  WAY overpriced.  I would pay these prices at Lucilles, but definitely not here.  Will not return."
1,"Very inexpensive fashionable clothes. They carry everything from shorts, jeans, tops, skirts, coats, and dresses. There is a large variety of clothes and styles. Won't hurt your budget."
1,Love this place! The creative bottles (and the fact that you can reuse them) make great gifts for anyone who enjoys cooking or is hosting a dinner party. Diverse selection of vinegars and oils - my favorites are the star fig and apple varieties.
1,"Surrender is a great place to go if you're at Encore already, and couldn't get into XS.  The lines are not that long, and the ratio is decent.  The cover charge was also only $40 when I went at around 11:30pm, but don't let that price fool you into thinking the drinks are also moderately priced.  In fact, drinks here are very pricey!\n\nThe decor inside Surrender is fantastic and there is a huge pool in the middle that I was very impressed with.  Also, the dance floor is pretty neat and is in its own section.  Not a lot of people were dancing though, which was disappointing.  I wouldn't recommend coming here in a group of single guys though, because all the available girls are at XS."
1,"Nice gelato shop that is part of a pizza/Italian restaurant. All the classic flavors are represented here nicely. The chocolate chip mint is great! I've heard that the pizza is ok, but the best thing about this place is the location. If you are with some friends at the sport bars just down the way you can walk to this location."
1,"We're on a family mission with our girls to explore all the Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. Little Bangkok in the Strip on Penn Ave. was Sunday's choice and what a pleasant surprise it turned out to be! \n\nEverything the 4 of us ordered was delicious! We started with fresh spring rolls with 12 pieces on the plate. Nice size serving and tasty. \n\nI loved the Pad Kra Tiem with a flavorful garlic and pepper sauce over lots of veggies with seafood. Mussels, shrimp, scallops and calamari in that delectable sauce. Call me happy! \n\nMy hubby ordered the Pad Kra Pow, a basil sauce with chicken and topped with 2 over easy eggs. There was some yummy sampling back and forth with both our dishes.  \n\nThe girls ordered Drunken Noodles and Drunken Fried Rice, both with tofu. Both loved the flavors and although the names sounded similar, they were very different and each tasty in their own right. They're pretty picky on the preparation of their tofu and both were very pleased and their entrees were large enough to take a lot home.\n\nThere are some unique and delicious flavors coming out of this Thai kitchen and I'm looking forward to going back again very soon!"
1,Food and service were great. I think we already know what we are going to try the next time we visit.
1,"I stopped in here tonight after grabbing some pizza at Mellow Mushroom. \n\nThe shop is small but is nicely decorated -- definitely trendy. You walk in and it's all self-serve: you grab the size of container you want, pick your flavor, and then finish off your creation with a few of the standard toppings. \n\nThey didn't seem to have too many flavors: raspberry tart, vanilla, and something else -- helpful, right? So on that note you can't really get creative. \n\nI had the \""White Boy Vanilla\"" with peanut butter cups. Peanut butter cups were stale but the yogurt was delicious. Like I am going to come here tomorrow good. \n\nI didn't run into the problems other have mentioned. The yogurt wasn't grainy for me and the service was just your usual \""I work at a yogurt shop\"" service. The cashier wasn't overly nice or rude. \n\nIt was $5.00 for 16oz of vanilla. \n\nI will be back...."
1,"With 100% conviction, I can say that I'm a better person thanks to the Karstadts. Master David Karstadt and his son John are not only fantastic instructors, but terrific people. My entire family took Taekwon-Do for years under their guidance and ultimately earned our black belts -- yep, Mom and Dad too! While I became proficient in the art of Taekwon-Do, it was growing up in a supportive, goal-oriented and respectful organization that has stayed with me 20+ years since I first walked through the door.\n\nTraining is both physical and mental, and people of any age or athletic background can enjoy and benefit from learning Taekwon-Do. I can still vividly remember when I was a white belt at La Mancha (a former location). Mr. Karstadt taught me to \""Look good, feel good,\"" meaning that I should take pride in how I present myself. I was seven years old, but it was a great lesson that I haven't forgotten. \n\nThe Student Oath and the Tenets (courtesy, integrity, perseverance, self-control, and indominatable spirit) have had lasting impact on me as well. My wife actually ridicules me for caring about integrity as much as I do -- and I have the Karstadts to thank! \n\nLast but not least, I got what every young boy wants: I was allowed to spar with my little brother with impunity!"
0,"Womp womp. The first time you serve me an ultra small portion of protein and no utensils I'll call you and let you know that that doesn't fly. I won't be angry with you, but I'll be honest that you'll see people slowly trying out other rotisseries like the one Down the street that charges 30% less. But now for a second time in a row I find myself sitting on my bed with an unacceptably small portion of protein and no take out set of utensils, napkin and salt/pepper and I've essentially paid $10 for a big order of fries. It's really too bad because I really liked chalet BBQ and even though it's on my block I'll now be taking the 10 minute walk to the other rotisserie. Disappointing."
0,"Alright, so as I mentioned the first 2 times we went the food was very, very good. Since my last review, we have gone 3 more times and sadly, I think they have a different staff of cooks in the back. Our first time back was for Mother's Day (actually the day before) and it was \""ok\"" - food wasn't as tasty and the quality seemed to have gone down (like it wasn't prepared fresh). We chalked it up as \""well, everybody has an 'off' night\"" and figured we'd come back anyway. So the next time we went back, same thing: food so-so, a bit on the bland side, and that freshness thing (lack of) was in the picture again. Still we were willing to bet on coming back. Went last night and sat outside, listened to live music - nice evening, but the food - freakin' again - was sub-standard, didn't seem like it was cooked fresh. Our server was terrible, as well - let our drinks stay empty, particularly bad when you're sitting outside, and didn't check on us very often. We ordered the molten cookie dessert, which previously was amazing, but this time it came out and wasn't even cooked on the inside -- we asked to have it sent back and another brought out and our server (after we finally found him) - said, \""it might take 20min, is that ok?\""  We felt like he was trying to brush us off, so in spite of that we told him \""no problem\"".  The second dessert was brought out in about 10min and was definitely better, but I think our server and the declining quality of food took the wind out of our sails. We may go back, but probably not for some time - feels like the first 2 times we went when it was great turned out to be the exception, unfortunately. Oh well, plenty of other restaurants out there, right? : )"
0,"I don't know, maybe I'm not clear on the concept of Whole Foods.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing really wrong with shopping at Whole Foods.  Whole Foods does have wonderful merchandise, but...\n\nI have found that I can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at Giant Eagle for less.\n\nThier wine and beer selection, supposedly quite remarkable in other states, well remember, this is Pennsylvania.  You can't buy those things at the grocery store.  \n\nI can get just as good quality meat and produce in the Strip District.  Sometimes, even better quality.\n\nI guess the benefit of Whole Foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and don't have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores.  I'm not slamming Whole Foods at all, but I actually like Trader Joe's better."
1,"Solid 4 stars.  Just the kind of taco shop I miss in Seattle. If you like SoCal Mex this is your place.  Delicious Carne Asada and breakfast burritos.  Go for the Bombero style if you like a wet burrito! Homemade Jamaica and horchata too.  Ohh yeah, this place was featured on Diners Dives and Drive throughs if that makes any difference to you."
0,"I am sad to have to write this review, since I love finding great businesses\nand deals to share with friends/family/etc. Unfortunately, I will NOT be\nrecommending Simplicity Laser to anyone. In fact, I will be warning people\nNOT to waste their time and/or money there. I purchased a Groupon about a\nyear ago for laser hair removal treatments. I have done laser hair removal\nbefore at Advanced Laser Clinics and got awesome results. I have several\nfriends and family members who have also had laser hair removal done at ALC\nas well as other places. All of them have had great results as well. So, I\nam no stranger to laser hair removal and how it works. So, my groupon was\nfor 8 treatments, with 4-6 weeks between each treatment. I spent the last\nyear of my life driving 40 minutes to and from Simplicity Laser (in\nGlendale) every 4-6 weeks. I have been finished with my treatments now for\nabout a month. I literally can't tell any difference in the amount of hair I\nhave in the treated area. I will generously say that i have had MAYBE 10-20%\nreduction. This is absolutely NOT typical and unacceptable. I mentioned my\nconcerns several times during my appointments and was blown off each time. I\ncalled to speak to a manager and was told that I should make a \""client\nreview\"" appointment to discuss my results and a possible resolution. I had\nmy \""client review\"" today and was basically blown off again, and told that\nthey weren't going to do anything to help me unless I purchased more\ntreatments. Basically, this company gets you in the door with, what seems\nlike, a good deal...and then treats you at a low level on the machine...all\nthe while trying to sell you more treatments. A good company will treat you\naggressively with the machines, so that you see results. And then you'll\ncome back to them because they work. I am very disappointed in this company\nand their business ethic, customer service, etc."
0,I've shopped Buffalo Exchange in Colorado and California and this location was a big disappointment. The clothes seemed overpriced and the store was poorly organized. Geez not even a sale rack at this store.
0,"We were just at coyote ugly and had an absolutely horrible experience. We went to the washroom and then the bouncer Martin Hampton would not let us back in. No one is an angel in vegas, but we were clearly not out of control. He claimed we  were and we are parents at almost 50 years of age with three boys. I don't know what they were up to, but they ruined our evening. When you are wrong, that is fine, but this situation baffles me. Don't you want business? and i write this note in the clearly inebriated state that they assessed me at? \n\nAVOID"
0,"Um. . .No.  \n\nHonestly, I'm in a major snit about this place.  I expected something a LOT better than what we found here.  Things seemed pretty good to start--food looked tasty.  Didn't take long for problems to begin showing up:  \n\nFirst off, my wife's lo-mein was pretty darned lo.  The first time she went here several days ago, they used the normal wide noodle that you would usually find in lo-mein.  This time, they used round noodles.  Were they Chinese chow mein noodles?  No, they were vermicelli.  Yes, I'm being a bit picky there, but I'm just getting started.  My wife ordered the lo-mein with no garlic, onions, or shallots.  The problem was, they left out most of the other vegetables as well when the bowl came to the table.  There was the occasional carrot or broccoli sliver, but very few veggies at all.  I called the waiter over to the table and informed him of the situation.  My wife told him that she just wanted to get a bowl of extra veggies to add to the lo-mein.  He took away the lo-mein that she had and said that he would be back shortly.  When he returned, he came back with two bowls--one had the vegetables she asked for, and the other was a brand new bowl of lo-mein with tofu and noodles ONLY.  Uh, what the f*ck?  Why replace the noodles she had with this and then send in a separate bowl of veggies?  Why not either give my wife back her old bowl along with the veggies or just mix up a whole new batch with the veggies?  \n\nMajor issues here--even what she got after all that wasn't very good tasting.  My wife had to add soy sauce for extra flavor, and the vegetables weren't fresh--they obviously tasted like they were frozen before they were put into the wok.\n\nMy food wasn't much better in terms of quality.  I had the vegetable and tofu fried rice.  There was no issue with the quantity of veggies, but they too were of the \""from your grocer's freezer\"" variety.  The rice was chalky and undercooked, and I also had to add soy sauce--it didn't do much to improve the flavor.\n\nOur spring rolls were also inferior, and even the fortunes in the fortune cookies were as superficial and vapid as the food we ate.  I liked the friendly table service, and the soda machine that allowed you to flavor the soft drinks any way you like was cool.  This is what made this review two stars instead of one.  But, would I recommend Pei Wei to anyone?  No wei.  If you want a REAL Asian diner, go to Tott's Asian Diner at Ray and McClintock.  Now THAT'S fresh food, and a world of difference over Pei Wei.  Even Panda Express is better than this place."
1,"THE STAFF:\nFriendly and able to suggest restaurants in the area. Helpful also with giving directions and obtaining a taxi for you.\n\nTHE ROOM:\nSpacious. Stylish. Comfortable. \n\nTHE BED:\nHuge. Comfortable. Nice sheets.\n\nTHE BATHROOM:\nGigantic tub. Separate shower. HEATED FLOORS which I never thought mattered but now I know they are heavenly. \n\nTHE PRICE:\nGood value for your money. They also seem to have deals if you call them up.\n\nTHE FOOD: I had lovely crepes and eggs benedict w/ smoked salmon for breakfast. It was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.\n\nTHE LOCATION: It is quite close to the subway and as mentioned the staff will help you with directions. Old montreal is a nice looking place, and it's a short / cheap cab ride to other parts of montreal if you don't want to take the subway. (Though you should, because it's easy and fast.)\n\nI would never stay anywhere else."
0,I was seeking a place that I could go to strengthen my marriage and was given a referral. The classes are group sessions and of the 2 hour block that you attend there is about 20 mins of content.\n\nIf you approach the instructor at the end of the class in a sincere matter you are quickly brushed off as the instructor seems to be trying to escape as if they know they place is about to be bombed.
0,"It must have been an off night, but my wings were horrible.  We ordered several different flavors and they were all bland and greasy.  The temperature at the place must have been over 80' and the decor looked worn down like our waitress."
0,We went to Native New Yorker tonight and two people myself and our guest ordered the bbq pork sliders. He ate two of his and I also ate two of mine and brought the rest home.  About two hours later my guest decided to finish off the sliders and while eating realized that there was mold on the pretzel buns.  We have never had an issue with food at this location but will now be very wary of eating there.  It turned my stomach to think I ate a moldy sandwich.
1,"I came in on a Sunday and they were doing a food photo shoot. It's always interesting to watch photo shoots whether it be people or food.\n\nAnyway, I had the chicken shawarma salad which is a bed of greens with a pile of chicken shawarma. I was surprised by the ample amount of meat.  The chicken and beef shawarma were both on a rotisserie and always carved to order. They also give you samples if you are undecided... That's actually how I choose the chicken instead of beef. \n\nI like it here and will be back to try the rest of the menu and the baklava, which I totally forgot to try!"
1,I must have gone on a good day as the service was amazing and really fast. I have the shrimp and petite biscuit which was the size of a quarter but beautiful and tasty. Also had the jambalaya which also was tasty followed by the famous banana cream pie which is to big for one person..Excellent
0,"A friend and I drove from the University area to have brunch at Bistro La Bon after reading so many wonderful reviews and the fact that I am an extreme foodie and love to try new places! We get here and check-in with the hostess and was told that they are not accepting anymore patrons due to an issue with the dishwasher (WTF!!!!) mind you, our drive was close to 30mins, & we had not eaten anything prior to arriving. I asked to speak to the manager to get some type of sympathy, apology, compensation for the inconvenience that was out of our & ofcourse their control! I was told that the manager was very busy trying to attend to the current dishwasher situation & could not speak with me. So, there we were standing outside the restaurant trying to figure out what we would do next. Along comes our saviour, one of the waitresses suggested that we try Soul Gastrolounge, so we did..."
0,"It was a beautiful summer day and my fiancee and I wanted to sit on the patio for a meal. So we stood waiting to be seated at the entrance, but none of the servers seemed to be too concerned about us or the people waiting behind us. Finally we asked a server passing by to seat us.\n\nWe then ordered a couple of drinks and a Canadian poutine. For some reason, such a simple order took more than half an hour to arrive, while the people behind us with large groups and large meals were served before us. Our waitress made rare appearances. The poutine finally arrived and although it tasted fine, it was nothing special and wasn't filling at all, especially for the premium price of $7.\n\nDon't waste your time at this tourist trap. There are plenty of similar restaurants around, many which are nicer. The menu is very limited and the service wasn't very good at all. Explore the alleyways and surrounding area, you will find much better."
1,"Bro. After a long night of dancing, this is one of the best things you'll find around Marquee N.C.\nMy friend (who lives in Vegas) took me here after a long night... and BOY WAS I GLAD that I found this \""secret pizza\"" joint.\nIT's SOOooOOo funny that there isn't a name for this place though...\n\nPeople were asking us \""where'd you get that!?\""\nAnd I'm just like..... \""It's a SECRET MAN!\"" hahahah I'm jp.\nIf you're a rookie at vegas... U ain't gonna find it. \nIt's straight up new york style pizza and my buddy that was from New York (or they pronounce it 'new yark') said it taste just like it.\nMannnnn. seriously... just try it out (especially after  Marquee). Pepperoni, cheese, w/e you want. They got it and it's bomb. It's not even expensive... ESPECIALLY since it's in cosmo. \nWIN-WIN sonnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!\nIt tastes like 4 star. But the convenience gives it +1."
1,"Great BBQ, and really nice people too!  One of the best BBQ places in town and not a dump like some of the other good places too!"
0,"Not a horrible music venue ... it just seems like they don't try very hard.  The venue seem to depend on outside promoters (like Charlie of StateSide Presents) to put on decent shows.\n\nThe worst of it is that the \""ankle biters\"" get to go right up to the stage while the profit generating drinkers are relegated to the back with poor sight lines.  F' that!!\n\nThis town needs a new Nita's Hideaway ... and sadly this aint it."
1,"The staff at Urbana Tire Company have always been very friendly, knowledgeable, and incredibly helpful.\n\nThey always provide real timely service at an affordable price and they don't give you the run-around with repair costs or deadlines.\n\nThey are located close enough to downtown Urbana that if you drop off your car you can take a peaceful stroll down Main street, maybe stop by the book store, or drop into any one of the dining/drinking establishments to have a cool beverage and a tasty bite to eat while your car gets fixed."
0,"Horrible place. We stopped in here between flights to try some NC wine, what a mistake! \nThe guy running the bar was terribly rude and made no effort to tell us about the different wineries or blends we were tasting. No seats at the bar and no service at our table. Also there was nothing in between each glass of tasting to wash the taste out from the last glass. In addition he wouldn't give any recommendations and of course told his trainees never to as they can't play favorites with the local wineries. \nThe guy behind the counter was training some new hires and talking down to us in front of them. What a character - he dropped innuendos to them that we were a  *bar crowd* - wow sorry if I don't look in top shape after a long flight! At least I know what good wine is and it came few and far between at this place.\nI will NEVER go here again. I hope it closes down or comes under new management!"
0,"I ate here 2 years ago and had one of the best meals. Not sure what changed, oh wait, it's the quality of the fish. I got the caldo de pescados. The sea bass was gross. So then they brought me a sea bass with ancho chiles that looked good but again, the fish was no bueno. I'm real sorry. I drove 30 minutes out of the way to come here and had 2 inedible entrees. \n\nCrab tostada, guacamole and margarita were ok but not worth the embarrassment of not eating 2 different dinners. The staff was super nice about it and the owner didn't charge me. I wanted to pay but he refused. So nice but I felt terrible. Bad dream."
1,The affagato was sweet and creamy! Two scoops of your choice gelato and two shots of espresso :)
1,"best sushi in this area. i've tried going to other places around centennial hills but nothing is as fresh as this place. plus its across the street from our house, so convenient for late night sushi cravings"
1,LOVE the Kung Pao Calamari! Definitely one of those craveable foods!
1,"I was introduced to burlesque shows a few years ago and loved it, so of course I sought out a similar venue on my first trip to Sin City. \n\nEverything I read said the cover charge was $20-25, but my husband and I got in for free. Perhaps because we were there early-ish? (10:30 with the first show at midnight.) \n\nAs other have noted, it is a small club, which I found refreshing coming from a smaller metro area. People there were decent and overall youngish (30s I'd say mostly) - no one real skeevy as I find at clubs back home. Dance music was described as \""hip-hop\"" but it wasn't any hip hop I know, but a good mix none the less. Drinks were eh, and as others indicated overpriced.\n\nOne thing I read about is that this is a celebrity hang out, and the club delivered - I got about two feet from Wayne Brady who has a regular show out in Vegas.\n\nThere were two entertainers who sort of go go danced to get the crowd going and then did a burlesque strip later in the night. One was excellent - very acrobatic, and one was ok. Not as much of a carnival looking act like other burlesque shows I've seen though. (ie magic, fire, hulahoops etc.)\n\nOverall very enjoyable considering we had a great night out with the cost of one expensive drink - which is a bargain as far as I'm concerned. I probably would have been disappointed had we paid $40 to get in because the \""show\"" was very brief, but because we got in for free it was a great night. Definitely worth checking out for a unique night out."
0,"Where do I begin, to tell the story? Familiar line I think. Let's start with all the great reviews I read about this place! Someone is desperate just to say they left their boring homes. I ordered my pizza by phone to be picked up. 1. I'm told they don't have green peppers only sweet red. Fine I can handle that.  2. I'm told 20 minutes it will be ready.  I arrive in 15. The pizza is ready. But it takes 10 minutes for the bartender, who is also the carry-out cashier to wait on me. 3. The pizza is no longer piping hot.  4. The pizza was supposed to be Italian sausage & \""Red peppers\""! I'm posting a photo of the pizza. See if you can find the sausage. I think there is more sausage on McDonald's sausage biscuit sandwich. I can here Clara Peller yelling \""where's the beef\"" from her grave. 5. The only reason that I'm able to give this place a star, is because the pizza was in fact very tasty. The sausage was very good when you could find a bite. Good sauce and fresh peppers.   I will probably try them again and order double sausage. Maybe I can put it all on one half and say I'm eating a SAUSAGE pizza!!!"
0,"Wow. It could have been great.  It could have been incredibly sexy.  It could have been a show to remember.  Instead, it was a painful flop.\n\nFirst, the good.  The girls were all quite beautiful, as you would expect from a show like this.\n\nNow, everything else.\n\nThe chairs all faced the stripper pole in the middle of the room instead of the stage where most of the action took place.  They were hard, wooden chairs which were quite painful to sit in. Since they didn't face the stage, you spent the evening with your head turned to the side to see the stage.\n\nThe performances, if you can call them that, were lack-luster at best.  The show was horribly choreographed, and the girls were seldom, if ever in synch with each other.  Sure, they went through the motions, but it was obvious that most of the girls didn't care to be there, and their poor attitudes really came through in their (lack of) performances.\n\nThis was NOT a burlesque show.  It was instead a really bad strip show, loosely strung together with the same dancers doing typical stripper routines over and over.  For the same money, you can get a better strip show at a real strip club here in Vegas, including transportation and drinks!\n\nLip synching songs on a stage production?  Really?  How about some effort and actually performing the songs?  The girl-girl scenes were all contrived, and there was no sense that any of the performers were actually 'in to' their performances.\n\nThe comedienne in the middle of the show was awful. Her jokes were tired and her delivery was way off mark.  She came across as insulting and un-funny, and couldn't even keep her own life story, which she attempted to weave into her act, straight. Her only purpose was seemingly to make an already bad and uncomfortable show even worse. \n\nBottom line: skip this horribly produced, barely choreographed, strip show where the girls aren't tipped so they have no reason to care.  Hell, Donnie and Marie would be a better show than this crap was.  We should have walked out like the other dozen or so people who actually had some sense."
0,"Erin K, is the most rudest car appraisal person that works for carmax, she verbally assaulted me and the vehicle i was trading in. I felt very violated, I made a complaint to the management and nothing was done. I didn't even wait to get the appraisal because I was so upset by the way she and her so called manager treated me. I actually went to another dealership and bought a vehicle that day. People, please don t make the same mistake I did, I would never support a company that would hire and employee such rude people, and then when it is brought to there attention they do nothing about it"
0,"I dropped in here after hearing Sir Terry Pratchett speak the the Glendale Council Chambers.  I was a little wary of stopping in, since I had to be back at school in about an hour.  I know brick oven pizza isn't really the quickest meal, but I wasn't hating myself quite enough to stop for fast food on the way back up north.  I'd just heard too many good things about the place to not at least give it a try.\n\nI ordered their white pizza (the idea of fresh mozzarella was too good to pass up) almost immediately upon sitting down.  I really lucked out too, because moments after I ordered, the lunch rush began.  Well, they staff behind the line are good because even with the flood beginning, my pizza came out in what seemed to be record time!\n\nSadly, after all I had heard about the place, the pizza itself fell flat.  The toppings were fine, the cheese was good, but it all tasted kind of bland.  I know, I know.  White pizza, not the paragon of flavor, but it still should have had SOME presence on palate.  I wonder if my expectations for the place were too high, considering I've seen lines outside this place sometimes (it's another Diners, Drive-In, and Dives star).\n\nWhile I was glad I had tried it, I still felt like this was another place that was undeservedly hyped up.  I hear that the pasta is good there too, so maybe I'll give it another try in the future.  My trust in the Food Network, however, is definitely waning."
0,"The last time I was in a fabric store I think I was 7 years old and with my mom. This time around I popped in here last minute to pick up some fabric for my toga pub crawl. It was to my chagrin that there was a LONG line at the cashier area ( I was pressed for time). Chagrin is not sufficient to describe my reaction when the line to cut cloth was just as long if not longer.\n\nI asked the lady behind in line \""So we have to wait in this line to cut our cloth, and THEN go wait in that other line to pay for it?\"" She nodded with a sympathetic smile. So out went my plan of being in and out in 5 minutes and 45 minutes later I was FINALLY on my way. \n\nThis was largely my fault since I left things to the last minute and because I failed to understand the rules of fabric store frequenting which is duly noted for my next trip to the fabric store which will probably be in another 30 years.\n\nThat being said,  I thought this was a ridiculous amount of time to take to purchase some cloth. Seriously worse than the airport!!!"
0,"*sigh*\n\n- do not sit at the bar for dinner\n- make sure the waiter listens to you and has the right order\n- pricey food\n\nWe sat at the bar since there was a long wait for the regular tables.\n\nStarted off with smoked chicken wings, asked for ranch - instead got blue cheese! The wings were alright, nothing to rave about.\n\nI love French baguettes! The bread that was given to us as a starter was warm and good.  The salted butter complimented well with the bread.\n\nPrime rib was actually mediocre. It had some flavor, but it just needed just a tad bit more. I loved the au jus more than the meat itself. It was a let down.\n\nOverall, I am not pressed to come back. The restaurant has a nice ambiance to bring friends to drink at the bar. The food, meh, I pass."
0,"One star (no pun intended) just to be polite. The worst expensive Indian food I have ever had. Had the chicken korma, it was bland and on the cold side. Would not go back."
1,One of the best sushi restaurants in the valley.\nThe food is fantastic and I go quite often.\nThe only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that they don't serve liquor/cocktails.  Everything else about this place is 5-star!
0,"For what it's worth, dor-stop isn't good as people say it was. People are fanatical about this place and its food. Is their food really tasty or they're popular because the network show? From my perspective, I detest their service, the service is notoriously horrible and unacceptable. Also the food was unpalatable. I order pumpkin flavor pancakes and side order scramble eggs. I was too full and their portion is huge so I left two pieces of pancakes. The waitress don't even bother to ask me if I need a box to take it home or if everything is good. Although she did refilled my coffee once, I barely see her stop by and there wasn't too many people in the diner is isn't likely she is occupied by that amount of customers.I think the waitress was rude because she never say thank you during the entire breakfast even when I tipped her. I should have known, I just feel like they treated me differently that's all. This review is based on my dinning experience and the service. Seriously if they mean business they should improve. Especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm. Do I want to come back? Never ever."
0,"I dont understand what is with this company. 1 minute i am told a rep from alpine windows wants to check out the color difference in the patio doors and the windows. the rep call me a 8:45 pm and said he would be coming over to see the color difference in about 2 weeks. well never heard from him again. then avw called and said they had the right color patio doors in and would like to install them, i said great. made the appointment for aug. 18, at 7am. well it is now 7:56 and no installers. I am so pissed off at this company. what makes them think my time is not valuable. I am so over and done with this company. AND I WILL NOT CHANGE MY 1 STAR RATING THIS TIME."

1,"UPDATE:  Early October - they closed their doors - the place is dark.   [sniff]\n\nA couple of doors down from Maizie's (see reviews elsewhere  in Yelp), Sweet Venezia is a wonderful gelato store.  The gelato is the way gelato is supposed to be -- soft & delicioso.\n\nThe people are friendly & helpful.\n\nI have been back, and I will continue to go back.  I hope you like it as much as I do."
1,"I've been going to BOX since the day I moved from LA. (it's been 7 years to date)  I love the ambiance of the place and staff is incredible.  Everyone is very friendly and professional here.  I would not trust anyone else with my most private areas besides box. \n\nNo catch here, nothing to hide, they are the best, just go to them and experience for yourself.  I have no quick tips just because there's nothing to hide.  THEY ARE THE BEST, enough said.\n\nWould not recommend anywhere else but here!!!!!!  \nAlthough I checked the box no appointment necessary, I am a planner and always suggest appointments to everyone.  makes things a lot easier and definitely more enjoyable when things are planned and expected."
1,"I love XS. Get treated like a VIP here. Lots of seating/ space. During summer months they do a Sunday Swim at nighttime and there's no dress code. Industry Mondays are a great day to get a cheap table. They have tables by the back bar so you can gamble. Get on guestlist with promoter for free entry, if you have to wait in line, good looking girls get pulled from the line to get in faster and reduced admission. Comp drink slips are good for up to $20 each. If Afrojack is playing, he goes until like 5AM. DJ is inbetween the outside and inside so there's no bad spot or table in the club, but there's only 1 room so you better like the entertainment for the night.\nDance floor gets SUPER crowded for headliners. I had to get saved once by a large Samoan bouncer because I was getting crushed. I owe him my life. LOTS of celebrities come by here and usually hang out by the stripper pole stage left of the DJ.\nGreat people that work here and funny locals/ regulars. Last time there was a guy doing magic for tips and he was AMAZING!"
0,"If you're a hipster with a Swiss Army knife keychain, a Northface tee, and a stand-up paddle boarding habit, this may be your favorite store. However, for those of us who merely entertain a seasonal interest in the outdoors, this place wasn't up to par.\n\nConsidering the price point and specialized nature of the products in this store, I expected more in the way of customer service. As in I expected to get some in general but received none. I love combining hiking with water, and was looking into whether it would be worth it to buy my own kayak.\n\nHung around the kayak section for nearly a half-hour, checked out prices, looked at straps to transport it, but was never asked if I needed help or had any questions. Kayaks, for those of us who didn't know, are generally about $400 here while stand-up paddleboards will apparently run you into the quadruple digits. Again, with prices like that, I shouldn't have to wonder if I can transport such a purchase on my own car, someone should have that info and be interested in sharing it with me.\n\nDid my own research here, and I'll likely continue to rent as needed rather than purchase, but even if I changed my mind I wouldn't be inclined to bring my business here."
0,The car showroom is a waste of time and money.  Complete rip off and the owner is a jerk.  Do not go here!
0,"We called ahead to see what the wait was and were told no wait. Great, especially since we had 90 minutes until a show at The Pressroom. Our group of 4 was sat quickly but it took about 10 minutes for our sever to stop by for drinks. 10 Minutes later we were able to place our order. 30 minutes and a second round of drinks later  the server realized the kitchen hadn't even started preparing our order. She was great about it and offered us a complimentary dessert. At this point we only had 20 minutes until we had to leave for our show so she sent the manager over. He asked what the problem was and if we still wanted our food since it was ready in the next minute. Sure, we want our food, we ordered it right? Our plates came out staggered over the next few minutes. The sea bass was undercooked and the prime rib was a little rare for our liking. \nWhen we commented on the meal, the manager simply stated he'd put a discount on the ticket but didn't offer to cook the fish a little longer, that it was cooked to medium (even though it was obviously raw in the center). \nOverall, great drinks and we'll go again for happy hour if in the area but not wasting time for another meal."
0,"The cafe was horrible to say the least. Worst 2 hours of my restaurant life experience. The service and the food both graded an F. Dined late night. Place wasn't very busy when we arrived and maxed at 8 tables during our 2 hour wait.\n\nOne waitress for more than 8 tables. Cold food, burnt toast and bacon. A white steak thing posing as a tbone steak. Bitter coffee. Slow service. High prices. \n\nWaitress kept calling us \""love, lovie and sweety\"". Not only annoying but excessively annoying. Made the experience feel torturous. \n\nWouldn't return or recommend."
1,"Absolutely love this place. This ice cream is totally new, inventive, and unique. I also love how you can choose from so many flavors and also from different milk options. I went for the yogurt flavor, soy milk, and added chunks of mango and pineapple. Perfect treat. The people that work here are soooo nice and really understand customer service. I love how they chop up the fruit into your ice cream and mix the liquid until it solidifies. Its like eating a science experiment! The ONLY thing that is keeping me from coming back is the location. I\""m a local, and hate going on the strip let alone going inside the Harrahs. Its really unaccessible. The owner however did tell us that they were planning on moving inside the Rio within the next few years so I guess I'll just have to keep waiting longer."
0,"First visit 3 stars, second visit 2 stars unfortunately.  I don't doubt the pasta is still A-OK, but I have to knock them down for their entree-sized salads.  \n\nI ordered a Caesar with chicken.  The addition of the chicken bumped the price of this jewel up to $12.95.  While plentiful, the romaine was so drenched in dressing, the crispness of the lettuce was lost.  The chicken was mediocre at best, certainly not worth the 5 bucks to add it.  A shame because the dressing was pretty good.\n\nMy husband ordered the Antipasto per Due.  With back olives, artichokes, ham, salami, provolone, and anchovies, it should have been a hit.  But again, drenched in vinaigrette.  Also the meats and cheese were just thin slices, nothing of exceptional quality.  At $14.95, this was a miss.\n\nWe also ordered bruschetta, but I had forgotten all their bread is sesame seed \""sub rolls.\""  Better bread is a must.  While I might consider Lo Cascio again, I'll stick with pasta.  If you see me carry a duffel bag inside, I brought my own baguette, too."
1,After moving here from out of state it was nerve racking to find a nail place after 4 years w/same person..Yelp didn't fail me! After reading the reviews I tried Pink & this is my new place!

0,"The BF and I are rarely in the area and I had to make sure we try to hit up points of interests, with this place at the top of the list. \n\nWe got some butter cookies and snickerdoodles which were pretty good, but standard as far as cookies go.\n\nWe also got half a dozen cake truffles and these were pretty to look at with cute flowers and leaves on them, but that was about it. The icing was thick, too sweet and fell off the cake when you bite. I took off the icing entirely off the pieces I got and some cake are too sticky and wet. I left 3 untouched and put it to the trash. Now I see Shari S. review and I wish I saw it earlier and avoided these all together or wish I only got one and tried something else.\n\nI'm not understanding the hype or I ordered things that were average and then  their worst desserts. They should maybe reformulate the recipe of or scratch it out all together. \n\nSo far, first impression was really disappointing."
1,"Wonderful little shop that packs in a whole lot of jewellery, scarves, paper products, and more.  Great place to find unique gift items or a little treat for yourself.  I went in looking for a birthday present and left with luscious soap and lotion, plus inspiration for many upcoming Christmas gifts.  The shop clerk was very friendly and was really enthusiastic about the soap/lotion line.  I like it when employees LIKE the products they sell!  It's easier to buy something from a happy person than a surly one.  :)"
0,"This is your typical wanna be Phoenix version of the Irish Bar.  The food was ok.  Typical sports bar fare.  I will say the service was pretty good except for the ditzy hostesses.  Do they really need three 16 year olds manning the front of the restaunt texting and pretending to be listening?  \n\nThe happy hour on Friday is great, lasting till 9:00 pm which is unheard of.  But dont stick around much longer after that unless you are  into the club scene. Because out come the lazer beams and smoke machines.... Hahaha no not really but they bust out the dance floor and make you move your seat so Glendales finest underage drinkers can shake their groove things.  It is funny how this bar resembles the cheesy old town bars that westsiders always seem to bag on."
1,"Been here a few times now and it is turning in to one of my favorite Japanese restaurants. I just love everything about this place.\n\nSo let's start with what matters: THE FOOD. Well, of course by now you should know I already think it's great. Ramen is superb, sushi is fresh, selection is GREAT, their menu is very user-friendly (they have small pics of each numbered dish), AND it is one of the few places I have come to find that serves OKONOMIYAKI -- one of my favorites. \n\nService is always very friendly and courteous, though sometimes a liiiitle slow (and it's not busy) . I have never seen it busy in here so that's good for no wait time for a table and the establishment is fairly large so it's nice and roomy. The dim lighting is nice and intimate so it makes for a great date setting or a night out with friends.\n\nWhat can I say? I just love this place. (Quadruple points for the okonomiyaki)."
0,"I never thought I'd be reviewing a McDonald's, because I do not support McDonald's and am ashamed of myself every time I go, but I just have to say...I have been going to this McDonald's since it was first built. While their inside is pretty clean and nicely renovated, I never go inside, so my review is in regards to their drive through. I would say that 9 out of the 10 times that I go there, they mess up my order. I have just grown to expect that I won't get what I ordered. Ask for grilled chicken? You'll get crispy. Ask for coffee with no sugar? It will be sweet as hell. Oh, and also, over the past couple of months I have noticed that they NEVER fill up their fries all the way anymore! Good grief."
0,"This place is a nightmare. YOU ARE SERVING CHICKEN WINGS, NOT GOLD NUGGETS. The price is outrageous. 2 people, no alcohol, dinner menu. With tip- $60. What are you people thinking???? I hear you can get some good deals on the lunch menu. Will not be finding out. Need to take a second mortgage to eat here. Not worth the expense. Go anywhere else."
0,"After having our first date at Akai Hana Sushi we were amazingly pleased with our service and the quality of our food.  Being creatures of habit we chose to revisit the restaurant for our Anniversary yesterday and the service was much less than what we had come to expect from Akai Hana.  Our server, Kevin, was polite and forgot to bring us plates, napkins and our drink refills.  After canceling our second round of beverages we left.  I attempted to call and speak with a manager or owner and was hung up on.  I am sad to say that we will not be revisiting the location of our FIRST DATE and truly hope they can work out the details to make their restaurant as good as it was before."
1,My only complaint I had before was the service. Not anymore!! They are going to open early just for my son's graduation celebration! Now that's service! Great service to go along with fabulous food at reasonable prices. Can't beat that!!
0,This might have been the worst Thai food I've ever eaten. I thought I'd be safe by ordering a salad and satay chicken delivery. I literally took one bite of chicken spit it out and threw the whole thing away. I would not recommend the Thai - haven't tried the Chinese dishes definitely won't
1,"I have been to crackers and company over 17 times. The service is always outstanding especially Byron. He knows the menu and he tells you exactly what you need to know to make sure your meal is fabulous. The food is always prepared perfectly and I'm very very picky about my breakfast. I would recommend crackers and company to everyone. Would I come back here, of course it's my favorite place to go in the Mesa area for breakfast or lunch"
1,"I LOVE The Loft. I've been going to my hair dresser, Kristine Forner, for the past 4 years and she ended up here a couple years ago. Everyone is friendly and they offer my favorite hair products. Bumble and Bumble! I would definitely recommend coming here to get your hair did. I also had Dawna Buckroff do my hair in a pin up style and she did an awesome job.  Two thumbs up!"
1,"This a great hole in the wall Vietnamese place. The pho is consistently good and so are the spring rolls. The prices are a bit higher than other places I've been, but still low enough to keep me coming back when I'm in the area."
1,They sell Cirepil wax!
1,"I am a fan....\n\nWe went here for happy hour last night... Got there around 945pm...... By 1015pm, it was completely filled....\n\nThey have 4 dollar beers and 4 to 9 dollar apps...\n\nWe tried the fries, really good and you get a lot...\n\nWe tried the beef sliders, which were solid...\n\nWe also tried the lobster rolls.... Tasty.....\n\nThe drinks were made right in front of us and were overall a ok....\n\nWe would go back on our next trip to Vegas...."
1,"They've jumped a to a stellar 5 stars... not because the food rose to another level as I really don't think it possible, being top of the Indian taste ladder as they are, but because...wait for it, I managed a joke with the guy behind the counter!!! Finally! \n\nWonders never cease and the Delta Indian Takeaway is No.1!!!"
1,"Absolutely Amazing Hot Dog! As a matter of fact, calling it simply a hot dog is an understatement. I had the Beer Hot- Aiko Style and was really happy with my choice. I would've never thought to put that combination of ingredients together on a hot dog but it works! The warm Naan bread was so good, I'm suck a sucker for warm bread. I visited them at Food Truck Friday's in Phoenix and the whole time I was there they consistently had the longest line of all the other food trucks yet their service was relatively fast. I'd say to go out of your way to hunt them down at least once because they are worth it! As far as a food truck is concerned I don't think they could've done any better! They have great food, an eclectic drink selection and friendly service."
1,"Everytime I go to Vegas I make sure that I make a trip to this lounge.  The ambience is very nice and the setting is very chique. I love how the owner has been innovative enough to come up with his own spices. He also makes sure a live dj us always playing.  This is something I havnt seen in many hooka lounges. Food is dead on and very healthy... something that I care about. Only criticism I have is for Vegas, this place closes too early at 1am! Check this place out next time u are in Vegas."
1,They have great food! Always clean in the store and you can even call ahead your order so you don't have to wait while they cook it fresh! Its not to long of a wait but at times it can be so to have this option available I love! This location is VERY hard to find though! More signs!!!!
1,Great Happy Hour Specials
0,"Hmm, what to say about Hakkasan... Well can't really tell you much about the inside due to the fact I couldn't get in; however, I do have some advice for my fellow yelpers and here it goes.\n\n1) As expected for a Vegas club be prepared to wait in line wether it be prepaid, guest list, or general admission \n2) If there is a big DJ spinning purchase pre sale tickets (guy tickets sell out before girl tickets)\n3) Guest list does not guarantee admission, we were on a guest list after being unable to purchase pre sale male tickets, waited over 2 hours, still had a bit of a line in front of us and were told \""you may get in on time to see Calvin Harris\""\n4) If you see a long line on general admission proceed to the nearest exit and find another club to go to\n5) If you just so happen to be a baller, this is one of those times it would be worth throwing down some extra dough to save yourself the headache\n\nAs for my night at Hakkasan, I was really looking forward to seeing Calvin Harris here on my first night in Vegas, as a matter of fact I was planning on proposing to him just because I love him that much haha. However, my dreams where ruined after waiting over 2 hours and deciding to go somewhere where we could enjoy a party from the inside instead of the line. As per many Yelpers recommendations my friends and I went to XS, end up seeing Rusko and had a blast!"
0,"Our pool isn't even 4 years old yet & we were told we need all new plaster!  Of course this is after both valves on the pumps went bad and had to be replaced in the first year.  But hey, its only $4400!!   The re barb & ties keep poking through, talk about shotty work.  And I agree with the other bad reviews, trying to get them to come out to fix their crappy work is like trying to part the sea.  Shame on you Desert Springs!"
1,"I recently had my hair done by Suzanne, and I couldn't be happier!! Most of my family and I have been going to her for 10+ years. She always does an amazing job for both men and women. I got my hair dyed this time. I sent her a picture of what I wanted ahead of time, and she went out her way to track down the perfect colors for the job. She really cares about her work and making sure it is perfect. Again, I couldn't be happier about my hair. So glad she's at a salon right around the corner from my house!"
0,"The Kitchener Delta is a classic case of bait n' switch. Their web site shows you pictures of their updated lobby, their bar area and their neon-blue swimming pool housed under a brightly lit atrium. All of this is true, but once you get past the lobby your experience goes steadily downward. \n\nWhile the bathroom of my room had been remodeled and was clean, the room hadn't been updated in ages. To be fair, the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable, but the finishings like the furniture and the carpets were well worn. The lamp shades are faded yellow and the televisions are older, small tube units.\n\nAlso, my room on the second floor was very, very loud. You can hear the traffic below through the double-paned windows. \n\nThe restaurant in the hotel is pretty run down. Even though their \""buffet\"" breakfast is free, it's well worth paying for something nicer on your own at a local restaurant. \n\nDon't be fooled by their \""fitness center\"" either. It's a bunch of run down equipment in a basement that smells pretty funky/musty. \n\nThe price was reasonable, but you really do get what you pay for. If you can afford $25-$50 more a night, I'm sure there are better places to stay. I hear the Radisson in Kitchener isn't so bad. Maybe that'll be my next stay/review."
0,When we walked in we were the only ones there and the person working didn't have a  great understanding of the menu. Our food took a long time to come out and when we got it the food didn't seem to the highest quality and was overly sweet like we were eating syrup or dessert I wouldn't recommend it.
0,"There's a reason they are only getting one star and that's because I can't give them NONE. ABSOLUTELY THE WORST, MOST UNPROFESSIONAL COMPANY I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH. I simply called to ask questions about a vehicle because I'm out of state and I was met with rude snide people who didn't even seem to want to answer any of my very simple questions. The final straw was when I asked if it had a clean car fax and was put on hold for over 8 minutes. Simple questions folks ! Selling a car isn't brain surgery. ALLOW ME TO WARN THE PUBLIC, IF YOU BUY A VEHICLE FROM THIS DEALERSHIP YOUR BUYING AT YOUR (OWN) risk. There are to many hungry dealers out there for you to have to deal with these horrible people."
0,"The pad see ew can be described in three words: Eww eeww ewww! I hate to say it, but I'd give this place zero stars if I could. I was in the area and since this Thai restaurant had 4 out of 5 stars, I thought I'd give it a try. Seemed like a sure bet...I mean 4/5 stars on yelp, can't go wrong with that right?! Wrong! \n\nI've had my fair share of Thai food and this has to be the absolute worst. I ordered pad see ew to go since I was headed to the airport but decided to taste my order while in the car (what can I say, my hunger got the best of me). I opened the box and the smell was just horrid. This \""fresh\"" meal smelled so spoiled my stomach turned!\n\n\nSide note for those of you who still want to give this establishment a try (even though I don't recommend it): they only take credit card on orders of $15 or more"
1,"Good choice if you are looking for a pricier Italian menu. They feature veal entrees and a pretty good assortment of Italian seafood dishes. Their homemade gnocchi and cavatelli are wonderful as well. The service is typically so-so, but the great food keeps me coming back."
0,I have been here for 40 minutes and still waiting to be seen while the employees are just chatting away up front. I guess they only have one doctor? Probably will not come back again.
0,"I had a very high hopes for Olives. It is a beautiful place and the fountains certainly add a lot of drama. The Bellagio is a lovely if somewhat dated hotel. \n\nI'm not sure why I tried the free range chicken but it was as extremely dry with very little flavor.  Michael had some kind of steak but it looked frightening to me so I decided against trying it. \n\nThey were busy and maybe it was an off night. Not on my list of places to revisit. \n\nFor the price of this meal, I expected something wonderful. Palatable would also have been acceptable."
1,"I've now made three trips to Lobby's.  The first was an enormous disappointment, the last two have been exceptional.\n\nOn my first trip, I made the mistake of ordering the Italian beef sandwich.  What I received could best be described as a thinly-sliced beef sandwich on a baguette that some jerk spilled soup on.  My sandwich was soggy to the point of disintegration from the moment I received it.  I tend to be a very neat eater, but felt I needed a bib that day.  In addition to the mess, the whole assemblage was bland and unremarkable.  \n\nHowever...\n\nI'd happily recommend Lobby's to anyone who wants a burger.  Upon hearing great things about their hamburgers, I returned to Lobby on two more occcasions.  On both days, I got a ridiculously large, juicy burger with great quality beef and fresh ingredients for a price around half of their competitors (I'm looking at you, Smashburger and Five Guys).  \n\nSo, go for the burgers and read the menu carefully: the single patty burger is 1/3 pound.  If you order the double, you're ordering more than a half-pound of beef and you will need a nap."
1,"Great place for tourist or locals, families or a night out with friends. Located in downtown but felt modern & hip, also clean and very secure (didn't run into a single pan handler) Cool art work, cute shops, good unique food & drink venues. I recommend pinches tacos authentic Mexican food, taquitos were delish and everyone around us had the taco plates which looked good too. Awesome  playground with tree house and mega slides (3 story high). At the entrance is a fire spitting pray mantis at the very back is a stage and open lawn for live entertainment, they even include big foam blocks to keep kids busy and cozy couches and heaters to keep adults comfy. Just go check it out for yourself. If you want close parking it's $1 per hr metered, or u can park in the free parking near main st/California hotel and walk a couple blocks."
0,"BORING...It's one of those \""very chic\"" shopping venues that is  sterile and dull with all the same shops you can see at any high end mall.  I'd rather walk around the TL in San Francisco. It's more interesting."
0,"Was very quiet for a Saturday night. Food ok, staff lovely."
0,"You know that feeling when you go to a restaurant and you don't want to give it a bad review? Well, today is one of those days. The food was sub par. We had ordered the guacamole which was pretty good. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the carne asada tacos which were better than the al pastor tacos I ordered. Mine were bland and dry. \n\nOur waitress however was on another planet. She was one of those waitresses who tried to impress you by taking your order but not writing it down. I have to admit, I do get impressed when waitresses do that, but I'm not impressed when they swing by 15 minutes after taking our order to make sure she remembered it correctly (this was done throughout the night). I also got annoyed how they would offer to bring chips but never did and we also waited forever for our food that should have only taken 10 to 15 minutes to make. FYI: the restaurant wasn't even busy, 8 people were there max on a Monday night at 7:15pm. \n\nBeing a foodie, I really dislike writing bad reviews but if I hadn't had such crappy service, or didn't have to wait forever for food that I had ordered, I think I would have had a better experience."
0,"Went there last night in hopes of finding some decent Mexican Food. Unfortunately, this was not the case. First of all, the service was lacking. It took us asking twice to just get a container of salt to the table. Also, the waitress was less than interested in helping us with anything more than taking our order. \n\nSecond, the food was atrocious. You know you have an issue if you need to add salt to Mexican food. The rice was dry (almost hard and old) and completely tasteless. The beans were bland and tasted like paste. There was barely any cheese in the enchilada I had. My husband's tacos wee haphazardly put together, falling over and impossible to pick up, and needless to say did not taste good. \n\nThe only saving grace was the shredded beef burrito and the Tomatillo-Avocado salsa. No, I will not be going back, even with the Yelp offer."
0,"For a restaurant with murals of Shamu and Flipper on the wall, Lahaina is suprisingly good.  Well, it was.   There was a time, back in ye olde early 2011, that Lahaina had a Chinese Menu and semi-extensive sushi menu.  Those days are over.  The Chinese menu is gone and the sushi menu has been whittled down to one page.  I guess it's to implement the new all-you-can-eat service?  Sometimes, change is bad, very bad.\n\nLahaina never was that great, slightly overpriced with mediocre sushi.  But you could get said sushi at 3 am! And you could get decent Chinese food (their house sizzing noodle plate was crazy good) and play video poker SIMULATEOUSLY.  The changes basically got rid of the restaurant element of Lahaina, making it a pub that serves california rolls.  I'll miss you Shamu and weird, sparkly ceiling!"
0,"the only cool part of this place is the gold fish tanks and the interior of the restaurant. the decor is the only reason this place gets stars.. \n\nthe food: gross... i mean seriously. they make only one type of noodle here and there is no way to have it any other way then the way it is on the menu. the portions are pretty small, so if you like noodles its going to suck for you, I love noodles and it was quite sad for me. the hainan chicken rice was decent. the dim sum shrimp \""har gow\"" was good and very shrimpy. but for 9 bucks you better hope so.  the soy milk was okay a little bland, the watermelon juice was good. o the vietnamese coffee, dont get it. its not good at all... \n\noverall the noodles are good. i just wish it was flavored better. the tomato based sauce noodles was good and the mushroom one was kinda too grocery store frozen food for my taste. o yea.. the dumplings both fried and steamed sucked so do without those. \n\nhaha.. good thing i didnt pay for anything. LOL i would have been annoyed even more."
1,"We went here last night for the first time and had a fantastic dinner. My husband ordered a spicy vegetable soup and we got two orders of chicken tikka masala. He didn't like his soup and said it tasted like spicy water with some spices, so we will try something different next time. The chicken tikka masala was AWESOME, but the rice it came with was pretty bland. Although I felt it was fine when paired with the masala. The garlic butter naan we ordered was seriously amazing! And dipping it in the tikka masala sauce was the best part of the meal. Our server was very sweet and very efficient, however they were definitely understaffed for the amount of people dining. I think she may have been serving most of the tables in the place. So it took a little longer to get everything than it probably should have but it was never so long that it was ridiculous. The restaurant itself is beautiful, very clean and well designed. You would never be able to know such a nice place is hidden in the shopping mall. There was plenty of open parking and it seemed like the place didn't get busy until 8:30ish; definitely a later crowd. Our price for the soup, two dinners, naan and 20% tip was $45; which was very reasonable. We will absolutely be back soon!"
0,"Overpriced, salty and overrated!!! Why this place is so popular I will never understand."
1,"YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!!  \n\nThis is one of the best sandwich place ever because everything tastes so fresh and great!  I love the fact that they have something for everyone here and what makes it so awesome is that it's cheap compared to all the other places around the Strip.  \n\nThe last time I went I had to wait for an hour to get my sandwich because of the long lines.  However, my friends and I went around 2-3 pm on a Saturday this past weekend and we got our food fairly quickly.  \n\nI had originally asked for the Tomato soup to go with my sandwich, but they gave me loaded potato instead.  I love soups and the loaded potato soup was really good, not too creamy, and it had this comfort feeling when I was devouring it.  Since this was my second time, I had the Montague again, it just hits the spot when you're hungry.  \n\nLove Earl of Sandwich!!!"
1,"The staff here is so friendly, I'd come even if the coffee was terrible.  Fortunately, the coffee is awesome too!  If you haven't tried it, get out of the Starbucks line and get to Dutch Bros."
1,To little dark in here but I love this place is very much but every time I leave I leave with my tummy so stuffed that I'm actually kind of cashed out for the night.  I hate that feeling but the food is so good I kind I have no self-control I usually always start with the rabbit confiiet as an appetizer and then I usually get the beef cheek ravioli with the duck liver and then I let Chef Doug surprise me with dessert... Perfecto!
1,"The food here is amazing; I love the innovation in the menu items.  However, we were there with a party of 10 and we were not served at the same time.  I think the problem is everyone was on a separate ticket and the kitchen staff had no way of knowing we were all together.  There were 6 pizzas, 1 burger, fish and chips and 2 salads.  The chicken Caesar came out first but my Brussels sprouts salad with chicken was the last entree served."
1,"Southside isn't normally the neighborhood you think to go for date night, but Dish is the perfect spot with its intimate seating, romantic lighting, and extensive wine list. \n\nWe split the charcuterie board to start and I ordered the linguine di mare. My dish was good, but because the sauce wasn't flavorful enough, even the seafood lover in me wouldn't jump to order it again. I tried my date's gnocchi - much better flavor. On my next visit, I may even consider just splitting a few appetizers. \n\nBased on the ambiance and excellent service, I would definitely return for a date or 2-4 person dinner out"
1,"Wow!! This place is great. Guy serving you the beer super friendly. Prices are average. Not a huge selection of beer, but not bad. Watermelon ale is yummy. Relaxed atmosphere. No food, but you can bring your own. Tours of the brewery available."
0,"Would have gave it a 3 star for a typical world burger chain restaurant, if it was not for the horrible service. We were walking down the main strip of Las Vegas Blvd. My friend Steve wanted to eat at Denny's, I said Hell no. Let go somewhere it's happening. Well we came up to Fat Burgers, right off the main drag. It was not to busy. I was not to hungry, but I ordered anyway. \n\nHere what I ordered, a large chocolate shake with whip cream on top, which it was really good. My sister ordered to Fry's, which it tasted like Burger King Fry's. It was not to bad. She also ordered the strawberry shake. She liked it. I drank the rest of it. My friend Steve ordered the chili, he said it was ok. \n\nNow to the service. We were #62, 63,64,65,66 and 67 were all waited on before we got our food. I sat and watch and stared at this guy making our shake. He took his sweet Ass time. I never in my life seen a human being take so long to make 2 simple shakes. Our waiter was horrid. I think litteredly  think he was stone. I had to ask him where is our food? He said\""ah i don't know\"". We finally got our food 45 minutes later. Remember this is a popular burger joint, the burgers and food are prepped. They suppose to cook the burgers quickly. \n\nBAD BAD BAD SERVICE for a renowned burger joint, we should have gone to DENNY's, at least we would have got better service. Hope to God the CEO of FAT BURGERS reads this YELP!"
0,"Interesting concept, ended up being pretty much what I expected and nothing more. Mainly Mexican style dishes with Korean style meats and flavorings. It wasn't bad, but nothing about it stood out, and the flavors weren't particularly exciting. It's a lot of food, which is nice, but quantity doesn't always mean quality. \n\nPlus, like pretty much all Mexican food in Las Vegas, it didn't hold a candle to Mexican food in Southern California. I'd rather hit up a taco truck in LA than anything I've had in Vegas."
1,Been here off and on but never for this long. I've been working here today for 5 hours so far because I was nearby when they opened. I had a drip coffee and loved it. So tasty and made cup by cup. Then a black mango tea that was the perfect aroma and need nothing. Later in the morning a friend came in and purchased a cappuccino. OMG it was the prettiest thing I've seen so I had to buy one. I have NEVER had a better one in my life. I am serious. Come here. Drink here. I love their iPad cash register & art. Late Sunday mornings the wifi gets a little clogged from the number of people but it's a cool joint. \n\nPS. I know Jeff M. had issues with their customer service but the two ladies working today rock.
0,The cupcakes are super expensive and I've had much better. The carrot cake cupcake had a strong after taste of nutmeg and cinnamon that overpowered the taste. The red velvet were just off... Can't really explain why... I was super excited to finally try this shop and was very disappointed.
0,"Closed! Took the money for camp knowing that it was closed! Gate locked July 21, 2014.  Neighbor said it has been closed for a year. Horses were seized"
1,"This place is pretty rad.  They recently finish a 2000sf + expansion and patio expansion.  The food is inconsistently good.  Really good during the days when the daytime bartender is cooking... I know for a fact they use Kraft Ranch.  \n\nMonday night trash talk poker is a blast.  \n\nTues is an awesome trivia night with a funny big guy hosting to a quality crowd.  \n\nWed is college night.  They start off with volleyball at the park across the street then real cheap drinks w college id and karaoke.\n\nThurs night is my favorite.  Beer Olympics!  a Coed tournament with 5 games, pool, darts, shuffle board, beer pong, bags and Gift Certificates for Gold, Silver and Bronze followed by their resident DJ Bon Joke.  He's pretty good. He mixes Karaoke with his videos and  DJ tracks and makes you wanna sing.   \n\nDJ Bon Joke is also the featured entertainment on Friday and Sat.  \n\nFinal Round is probably the only bar in Tempe I'd give 5 stars to."
0,"I don't like leaving negative feedback for anyone and always try to give the benefit of the doubt.  I understand it's a busy time but there is no excuse for bad manners.  That being said... Worst customer service ever!  Over they years I've used many different car service companies for business travel and this one has the worst service.  I was booking travel for a week out for my boss and submitted a request online; 24 hours later still hadn't heard a peep from them.  Next day I called to make sure they had received the request and get a confirmation number.  They guy basically told be he'd get to when he'd get to me and that there was time.  I gave him the benefit of the doubt and waited for a return call... nothing.  One and half days later  (today) I call again. I needed a confirmation number for my boss who was leaving this afternoon for other portions of his travel.  The same guy basically yelled at me and said he'd get back to me.  I tried to tell him I need the number today due to other travel.  Finally I just said \""Forget it, if your customer service is this bad I don't want to use you.\""  He could have politely said he's super busy but promised to get back to me.  If this company can't return a phone call in a deceit time frame, how can I rely on them to actually be reliable for a pickup? Not to mention that I wasn't even sure they could accommodate my request.  To bad for him... I work for a CEO of a major company and my boss will be traveling to Phoenix a lot over the next year and beyond.  He just lost a big chunk of change."
0,How sad after all these years they open a second restaurant and let the quality of their food totally tank!!! We live in mesa and have been going to Vito's for pizza for 17 years ! we are originally from Chicago and this was the best pizza we could find in arizona and after the last 2 visits this month it is clear they have changed the way they make their pizza ! Sad it tasted like a store bought one you throw in the oven I am sorry to say we will never eat at Vito's again...
1,"This was our first trip here and our initial impression was favorable. The location is not great as it is in North Scottsdale and is therefore a long way from downtown Phoenix or even downtown Scottsdale. We made reservations for 6:30 p.m. on  Friday night and so they had a booth ready for us when we arrived a few minutes early. The waiter (Tomas) was very attentive and polite and had water then drinks on the table very quickly. Because we checked in as Yelpers we were given a special coupon (on our phone) for a free appetizer (the lettuce wraps-yum). After we had finished our appetizer, the waiter asked if he could see our coupon again so he could show it to his manager. As we had already clicked \""Use it Now\"" we could not show it to him so he borrowed our phone and showed the manager that we really did have a Yelp account and so we were given the special deal (did the manager not know about the coupon?). For our main course we had the Bamboo Beijing Duck and the Pad Thai Rice Noodles. Both were very tasty, but not the tastiest (4 star). I think that the dipping sauce for both the lettuce wraps and the duck came straight out of a bottle and was not a prepared sauce. If the Bamboo Club wants to compete with P.F. Chang's then it may want to upgrade its dipping sauce presentation. Overall a very pleasant dining experience, however, if you are staying in Phoenix, it is at least a 30-minute drive to get here so plan your time accordingly."
0,Too expensive for very very average food.... Outback steak is probably better .... No ambiance.... Old cliental...\nGood bar & great employees ... Concept poor ... Many better choices in area.
1,"Thank God for their $25 3 course late night menu!\nI'm a night owl to begin with, so this is perfect for me.\n\nI had heard grumbles before that the clientele was snobby and looked down on certain others, I can definitely imagine this is the kind of place that gentlemen were asked to wear a suit and tie to dine here in the olden days.\n\nThe cheap menu is going to bring a different clientele i can kind of blend into, so it works on so many levels.\n\nTheir regular steaks are in the $40-50 range, chicken and fish is slightly below, the sides are an extra $5.\n\nFirst nice touch: complementary pickles and coleslaw, normally not a fan of slaw, but this one was the best I've ever had. The baguette was also quite good. \n\nI had the chopped liver, tiny scoop with fried onions, very delicious but small in size.\n\nOnto the rib steak, the fat is so succulent you will eat it up, do not leave it on the plate, that would be a tragedy. The piece was about10oz in size, so decent, it comes with a decadent Monte Carlo Potato.\n\nMy friend got the Kobe Burger, it was good, but M:Brgr does it better, \nOur meal comes with coffee or tea, but no dessert.\n\nDessert was the main drawback, No Millefeuille, no Cheesecake, No Tarte Tatin,\nso our fourth choice was Panna Cota and Chocolate Cake ($12 each)\nThe price is just too high and the desserts were just ok, but i guess they need to make their money back somehow.\n\n\nThe setting is very upscale masculine, people are loud, but that's OK, I like the fact we had a nice table by the window. The service is curt, competent but not overly polite.\n\nTheir late night menu is tantalizing, and I would love to try every item on there."
1,"This, along with DCR \""Downtown Cocktail Room\"", are my favorite bars in Vegas. Stop by and try a drink. The bartender, Dan, won't do you wrong. \n\nI've been to a bunch of mixologist bars and Dan knows his stuff. Note the following:\n\n1. Make a reservation via text.\n2. The bar is located inside Commonwealth. Tell the guy at the door and they'll let you right in.\n3. Text the bar as soon as they enter. They'll guide you from there\n4. No photos and no talking on cell phones.\n5. Sit back and enjoy!!!\n\nCheers!!"
1,"Not that far off the strip rests one of the greatest breakfasts you've ever had. We went at about 10:30 and had to wait for about 45 minutes, but it was worth it. Ordered the Andy's sage fried chicken. It was amazing. \n\nStarts off with mashed potatoes, then two great biscuits on top of that. Then comes the delicious crispy fried chicken with tons of scrambled eggs on top, a grilled piece of cheese, and then the chipotle hollandaise sauce. I left the place being one of the most food-drunks I've ever been."
1,Food is really good and they serve an extensive menu without any omissions after a certain hour which to me is amazing.\n\nAll the food servers and the waitresses are incredibly friendly and sweet.
0,"Mew?  Hello? Where is my rental car?\n\nStopped by the desk the day before to see if they had any SUV type vehicles available.  The lovely woman at the desk said not at the moment, BUT they would be bringing in an SUV from the airport location for the next day that could be ours.  Hooray!\n\nCut to the next morning at 11.  The indifferent man behind the desk was indifferently indifferent as to the whereabouts of said SUV.  It took him a good 10 minutes to master the computer and locate it at the Encore lot.  He sends a man over to get it.  We are told to wait.  So wait we did..... and wait.... and wait....\n\nA half hour later? we are on the road.\n\nThe vehicles come with a GPS for no extra charge, which is wonderful.  It is also discounted to let them fill up the vehicle with gas instead of doing it yourself.  Jackpot! Our ride was nice, but the price seemed high for a day rental."
0,"I am surprised at how many positive reviews this place has received.  I was so excited to try this place because others had talked up how good it was. I live in Phoenix and the selection of sushi restaurants there is phenomenal!  I went here for lunch with my sister and ordered a lunch special.  I tried to force it down, but was unable to.  Maybe they were having an off day or the sushi was old...either way I will not be back to find out."
1,"I was shocked to see the lower ratings for this restaurant. I found it interesting and refreshing. \n\nThe live music is a nice touch to the delicious food that they serve. I do think that the band is in an awkward place, because its blaring at you the minute you walk in the door, and people are standing around to watch them while making it very crowded and difficult to enter. \n\nI have gotten the seafood, which is seasoned and very good. The macoroni is really good, and the collard greens are amazing! \n\nThe decor is very modern, and cool. I love this place, and will be a regular, BUT, (there is always a but) - the service is very average. The wait staff seems nice enough, but they often disappear and leave a feeling of abandonment. \n\nOtherwise, the food and the entertainment is worth it!"
0,"So I went on Priceline which btw is another serious issue because when you buy package deals from them; they don't let you pick the time or day you want to come in. Anyways back to the crappy hotel that is the Excalibur. It wasn't just the fact it was cheap looking and smelled like your Grandmas house that has 20 cats and smoke a pack a day; it was the customer service, the lack of housekeeping and the overly priced rooms that are not worth your money. My sister and I stayed for four days and not once did our room get cleaned. My sister left a mark on the sheets to see if they would be switched the next day and sure enough they were never switched. On top of that the lights went out and they wanted to charge me $130 to extend my check out for 2 hours. The customer service is horrific, especially for a Vegas hotel. I get the hotel is old and everything but come on people, have some pride. My sister lost her phone and asked customer service and the lady was SO RUDE to her and just said \""im sorry but I didn't see a phone\"", without even looking. So my sister goes to the manager and complains about the rudeness and also about her phone Sure enough the phone was in lost and found!\n\nPeople even if your looking for a cheap reasonable hotel...don't even waste your money. Stay at the Luxor which is nicer and reasonable and actually give a shit about their guests!"
1,"My sister and I got lost and we ended up finding Crepe Expectations. I love crepes and convinced my sis to go. We got the Sonora (carne asada, roasted tomato salsa, guacamole, and jack cheese) and split it because we weren't really hungry. But it was so delicious!! The crepe also came with some fruit on the side. I like how they are specialized in crepes and not 10 different things and their menu may be short but from our Sonora crepe; I bet all the crepes on the menu are good too.\nThe decorations inside gave you a chic feel to it. The atmosphere was quiet and peaceful but the owners told us we came after the rush hour. We both talked to the owners and they were really nice. We found out that they make everything in the kitchen fresh every day. They're trying to make their own hummus. Outside they have some food and water so it's good if you want to bring your dog or cat with you. Although in the heat, I think the water would be boiling. We live on the other side of the town but we are definitely going back the next chance we get. Especially when we did get to try the dessert crepes."

0,"I had a pair of judo pants repaired by Hanna and was very disappointed in both the repair and the service I received.  She said on the phone that she was totally comfortable taking on the job, and when I dropped them off, she said it would be no problem and we discussed exactly what she would do.  When I picked them up a week later, I found that she had repaired the knee with a weak, stretchy fabric.  When I said I didn't think it would hold, she said, \""I don't even do repairs, I do alterations!\""  I would have liked to have known that in advance.  \n\nWhen I got home and inspected the job more closely, I found crooked stitching, extra threads hanging off everywhere, and a generally very rushed, slipshop quality of work.  They tore again less than three weeks later.  When I brought them back in, she refunded my money but didn't even apologize for my wasted time and had nothing to say about the poor quality of her work.  She then made a rude comment as I was walking out the door.  When I called later to say that I hated to leave things on a bad note, she hung up on me.\n\nNow I'll have to pay someone else to fix the job she did, and the pants have been further damaged by tearing out again.  I found her outright rude throughout the experience when I just wanted to have a civil conversation.  I'm very, very unhappy with the whole experience.  Take your money elsewhere to someone who takes pride in their work and knows how to be civil to customers."
1,"Pretty Good.  Pretty Good!\n\nNormally Gyros, falafel, and tzatziki give me indigestion.  But this time, it did not.  \n\nThe spanakopita was alright.  But the Falafel, gyro, and fries were tasty!  And I swear, the guys behind the couner were actually Greek!"
0,"I first experienced Ian's at the Chicago location.  Now granted the alcohol may have created a biased opinion, but after realizing there was an Ian's in Madison, I was immediately enthused.  The idea of putting delicious dishes onto pizza which is almost always delicious in and of itself is mind boggling for sure.\n\nUpon our arrival, we ordered 4 differnt slices to share and sample.  We took our treasures nearby lakeside to watch the sunset over bbq chicken, pesto alfredo, philly cheesesteak, and some other flavor I can't recall.  If it weren't for the scenery, the whole experience was wholly disappointing.  All four flavors were lacking in well, flavor.  The bbq chicken was the only decent of the four and the pesto was a far second.  Overall, it was quite the disappointment.\n\nI don't recommend eating at Ian's unless you've had a few, but I do encourage you to stray half a mile near the school's campus to partake in the live music and summer scene."
1,"I've been a fan of Sardine for both brunch and dinner for awhile, and just ended up there twice in quick succession. One time out of the recent two, I needed a reservation for 12 that happened to change twice. Everyone I talked to was great, no problems with the changes, and the hostess set our table a bit apart from the Saturday night holiday madness. While I wouldn't say that the food tends to arrive quickly, I've always had good service (even with the group of 12), nice recommendations, and good advice on ingredients or substitutions when I've asked. I don't eat red meat, so that's always appreciated.\n\nWhile it gets loud at busy times (and it does get busy), I like the industrial/bistro atmosphere, and especially the view over the lake. Ask for a table near the lake windows (or, when it's warm, the outside tables!) for a bit more intimacy. There's a wide selection of beers and wines, including reasonably priced and quite good house wines, and some lovely specialty cocktails.\n\nFor appetizers, I've recently ordered the picollo fritto and the cheese plate. Recent unexpected favorites among the picollo fritto items have been fennel and lemon. The cheese plate had a nice variety of cheeses, many of them local -- cheddar, blue, chevre, etc -- as well as fruit and a unexpectedly delish vegan \""salami\"" made out of figs and nuts. I had salad and fish for dinner on both of my recent visits (the salmon once and the mahi mahi once), and both were fresh, grilled nicely, and clearly served quickly. Well marinated, hot, moist, and flaky. The lentils that came with the salmon were a bit on the salty side, but the bok choy & fennel with the mahi were a lovely sweet-and-sour complement. Yum. My husband is a fan of their cassoulet and their steak (although, warning, the steak does come with both frites and butter). Overall, their fish seems reliably great, but I haven't been thrilled with their pastas when I've tried them in the past. The orechiette sauce, for instance, is oily and a bit too heavy on the garlic and olives, which overwhelms the broccoli rabe and tomatoes. Sad, because I adore a good broccoli rabe. As far as desserts, I've tried a bunch of different items, all good. The chocolate cake and the sorbets (rotating, often in unusual flavors like olive oil or buttermilk) are favorites.\n\nSo: while I wouldn't say that everything is fabulous at Sardine (hence the 4 stars), there are a lot of very good options. It's a nice place with a good vibe, accommodating of large or small groups, and definitely on my Madison favorites list. It's worth the trip (or a few!)."
1,"AZ 88 is a cool bar / restaurant in Scottsdale.\n\nThey have a good selection burgers, sandwiches, appetizers, and salads. They serve food till pretty late, so this is a great place to go after a night of drinking.\n\nThe highlights of the food menu are \""Galettes\"", which is crispy flat bread topped with cheese, bacon, olives, and onions.  The other winners are the \""Burger Alfredo\"", and the \""Hot Pepper Chicken\"" sandwich. The \""Burger Alfredo\"" is topped with alfredo sauce, tomato slices, and fresh spinach. The \""Hot Pepper Chicken\"" sandwich has a chicken breast that is marinated in lime juice, and is topped with jalapenos and honey.\n\nCool bar along with a good food menu gives AZ 88 four stars."
1,"I've been to this place twice and enjoyed myself both times for brunch. The first time I had french toast and potatoes, which were really delicious. And then of course we had bottomless mimosas and they were fabulous.The second time was more recent and I had bananas foster. It was SO GOOD. I wish they put a little more banana on top, but I still loved it all the same. Both times the place was crowded and we ate upstairs. The mimosas were great again and we had a nice waitress who didn't take forever and ever with our orders and checks. I would definitely come back."
0,"Never even got to try nor did I care to try. Rude owners and daughter or counter girl, and waited in line for a while. When we were next in line w were completely skipped over for obvious family or friends because they went past us to them directly never even said hi or anything started chatting them up about what cupcake they were telling they should try and about other issues. Completely rude after waiting a couple minutes of them chatting it up and choosing a cupcake we left without choosing ours just surprised at the lack of customer service. Hopefully you get better service than we did. I would not go back just a huge turn off."
0,"They once were good...not any more. Charged me $17 to do a full wash and interior dressing. They did a half a$$ed job, never put the interior dressing on, left my antenna on through the wash and lost my cupholder ashtray. They must be too cheap to run the A/C in the waiting room, it was hotter in there than it was outside. Lousy place, poor service. Pass them by."
0,"Ok so I'll start by saying I used to work for JM at other locations (FL,NV). For the longest time I wouldn't go near another franchise (Subway, Quiznos, etc). Lately however, I find the prices at JM to be rediculous for some of their sandwiches. $10 for a giant?! Seriously? They used to be 8 bucks. For someone like me who gets their philly steak with just cheese and onions it makes for a pretty measly sandwich. We used to throw in a little extra meat if someone didn't want any other toppings otherwise the meat gets lost in the bread.\n\nThis location is by far the worst I have ever been to. The employees at McDonalds and Taco Bell have a higher IQ and a better attitude. Ordered a philly steak with just onions. How easy is that? Not easy enough I guess. Luckily I was watching and noticed her throw on peppers instead of onions. I would understand if it was a busy day and there was a line of people with lots of orders how it can get mixed up but the store was empty and I was the only person there. There were other employees hanging out on one side of the store talking loudly with either friends or co-workers cursing, making out, etc.\n\nOne of the girls even mentioned loudly how she had to go pick up her mom from prison bc she just got released. (lol)\n\nAnyway- the food is still good quality but make sure if you are going to go to any JM find a coupon first. Lots of BOGO coupons and stuff out there. Def worth it if you get a BOGO."
1,Had my hair colored by Bradley. I'm very picky about my hair and I loved this place...will definitely go back.
0,"Sunglasses were stolen out of the glovebox. The onsite manager and KIDS that washed my car gave me attitude about it afterwards. Cops came. Still no sunglasses. Best part, their Corporate VP offered me free car washes as the \""best they could do\"" even after admitting to me he'd never go back to a place that stole from him! AVOID FULL CIRCLE CAR WASH AT ALL COSTS!!!"
1,Was in town for the weekend and needed a quick lunch. I had the Arizona burger and the rosemary garlic fries. All around a good burger and fries at a good price. I'm a fan.
1,"Review #50 of a place befitting such a milestone!\n\nMy friend and I headed over here last weekend and as I was sure this place had to be more hype than substance, I was a little trepidatous about the visit. Seriously I couldn't have been more wrong!!! So much so, that since we were there on a Sunday, or visit extended from the Brunch specials, right through to the beginning of FEZ Foodies (in other words I had to leave a HUMONGO tip because we took up real-estate for so long!).\n\nAs there have been a bazillion reviews already, let me just say a few things:\n1)   Fabulous service\n2)   One of the best burgers I've ever eaten\n3)   Hot Brownie topped with the perfect Vanilla scoop - served so hot and steamy that if I weren't afraid of burning my skin, I would have covered my body with the stuff just to be closer to its goodness!\n\nCan't wait to check out their nightly drink specials (I'm already anticipating having to introduce myself as... \""hi my name is Julie and I'm a half price margarita addict\"")."
0,after the sixth time that they screwed up the telephone call I finally gave up.  They must not want my business.  They had my pnone number but no call back. FORGET ABOUT IT !
1,"I have 2 cats, and I love this place.  I buy them things like Innova Evo (dry and canned) and Nature's Variety frozen raw meat medallions, which are difficult to find.  I can get the Evo at the Tempe Feed & Tack, but they don't have a freezer for the other food.  Sunflower even has the canned duck, which one of my cats inhales.  Previously, I was going all the way out to In the Raw in Gilbert for the frozen stuff, ugh!  I'm so thrilled this little place opened!  It's not too far from my house, and the owner is awesome.  Great product selection.  Closed on Sunday."
0,"My daughter has been coming here since birth. She's 6 months now. It's frequent hour long waits, even when booking first appt of morning. Walking in and they don't have the appt I made booked, or when calling after hours for a nurse call, no return phone call. I've given them Atleast 5 chances to redeem themselves and am done at this appt. I stayed because we loved dr Krishen, but she is repeatedly late. My time is just as valuable as hers!!"
1,Thank you for having a nice place for the kids to play soccer!  The coaches are engaged with the kids and are very active.  Our 3 1/2 year old daughter learns to listen to Coach; play well with others; listen to detailed instructions; dribble down the field; and to have a lot of fun.  I'm looking forward to watching her develop the age appropriate skills as she advances in each class and hope that she continues enjoying the game for years.  It's a great program and an awesome alternative to scorching heat and blustery winds outside.
0,"I wasn't really all that impressed with this place. It seems pretty popular given that it seems to be full whenever I walk by, and acquaintances have said they loved it. \n\nI wanted to like it, as I am all for their \""locally sourced\"" ethos.\n\nIt's designed as a small plates kind of joint, maybe something like \""midwest tapas?\""  Many dishes are served family style for sharing, but limited entrees are offered.\n\nOur group of 4 went on a weeknight at about 7:30. It wasn't packed and there were a few tables open. We waited for about 20 minutes for them to prep a table. Not sure why it took that long. After we were seated it took another 10 minutes for water to be delivered by a runner. Then another 5 minutes for our server to finally arrive. We had been mulling over the menu over those 15 minutes so we were ready to get a drink order in, and our first round of plates. We all noted the slow service.\n\nThe atmophere is pretty cool though. It's mostly windows so you get a great view of the capital building and the square. It is a bit loud, but certainly not as loud as the Old Fashioned can get.\n\nWe ordered our beers along with the mac & cheese, the plate of house pickles, and the charcuterie. \n\nOur beers took  at least 10 minutes to arrive. Then another 15 minutes for the first plates. We asked the server to point out the offerings on the charcuterie plate, but the server could only point out the salame and mortadella, the only ones I recognized immediately. Not much help there. The mac & cheese was merely OK, I like my own better. The pickles, while pretty good, were nothing to brag about. Though I will say the pickled squash was pretty memorable.\n\nOur server didn't come check on us for quite a while, though I'm not sure how long it was because we were contently conversing. We had to flag her down to order more beers and the next round of plates. Not cool. A couple of us also decided to order entrees along with the additional plates. \n\nThis round we ordered the fresh bread basket, cheese board, and deviled eggs. For entrees, we ordered the asparagus/frisee salad, the seafood stew, the market steak, and I ordered the Graze burger, it's touted $19 burger. Yes, a $19 burger. I couldn't NOT try it. Once.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later and our small plates arrived. These are all good, but how do you screw up bread and cheese? The deviled eggs were pretty good but nothing to come back for. 20 minutes later, the entrees arrived. And actually, everyone loved their entrees but me. Like any good midwestern man, I do like me some burgers. Plus I've got an open mind when if comes to them. This burger is a mix of sirloin, ribeye & short rib meat served on a brioche bun. This sounded fantastic to me, but it didn't deliver. The brioche bun arrived with a completely soggy bottom, and the combined flavors of the caramelized onions and the bun was sweet. Yes, sweet. I do know that brioche can be a sweet kind of bread, but maybe I was expecting something else. Anyway, the sweetness ruined the burger for me. I just don't get down with sweet burgers, even though the meat was high quality and perfectly done. I didn't finish it. The fries that came with the burger were also overly soggy with grease, only the very tips were crispy.\n\nWhile everyone in our party knew this place was a little expensive going in, we didn't feel we got our money's worth. If I'm with a group that decides to go, I'd probably try it again. There were a couple other menu items that looked good, after all. But I'd rather go elsewhere.\n\nMy rating is based on -2 points for the slow, crap service, and -1 point for the lack of value."
1,I went in to get my diamond earings new backs since I keep loosing them and while I waited I looked at new settings for my diamond ring. With the help of Michael I found an awesome and I mean awesome setting. \nThe next day my diamond was reset into the new setting while I watched and waited. \nA wonderful experience. The ONLY place to go for great jewelry. Just love you guys!

0,"Meaty wings, bland sauces. I don't like a whole lot of spice on my wings, so ordered the mild and the garlic parm, but still expected SOME flavor...not so much. I made my own sauce and tossed the wings in them- much better. Good quality chicken. Avoid the fries."
0,"I hate to rain on the parade of 5 stars, but I was not impressed with my pizza.\n\nI ordered for delivery through foodie call and had a custom pizza made of goat cheese, proscuitto, and arugula - my go to. The pizza came within the expected time frame (45 minutes) and I was excited to give it a try.\n\nThe first red flag (you can see by the picture) is all the toppings were plopped in the center. Who likes eating their pizza with no toppings on the outside and then mounds of it on the other side? I spent the next 5 minutes redistributing the toppings so it was evenly dispersed throughout the pie. Second, where was the proscuitto?! There were tiny cut up bits of what tasted like ham sprinkled on top, but definitely not the thin slices of salty, savory proscuitto deliciousness I was expecting.\n\nThe ancient grain crust, however, was very good and I also enjoyed the brown sugar cinnamon dipping sauce that came with it. I'm willing to give Pure Pizza another try...but I'll surely be there in person to voice my criticisms."
1,Red Rock is one of my favorite.. Well it's my only favorite locals casino! Prior to Aliante no longer being my favorite stations casino RED ROCK has now defaulted to being the only! This is a great hotel for locals to play that live around the Summerlin Area! Very conveniently located off of Charleston/ 215! I have gambled as well as played here and every experience including the movie theaters have been very pleasant! Always a plus to have such great hospitality as well as a clean facility to go to just to hang out!
1,"21 Dec 2013\n\nThis was my first time going there, and I took my girlfriend around 4:30pm on a Saturday. It was already packed, so I had a good feeling! We got seated immediately since it was just the two of us. We looked at the menu and was surprised to see that they had half off selected sushi for 1/3 of the menu--maybe more.\n\nWe ordered a salmon nigiri and seared white tuna nigiri. Hands down these were the best in the area. We also got the Gordon Gecko, Eating Nemo and Chuck Norris rolls. Eating Nemo was a glorified california roll--I wouldn't get it a second time. Gordon Gecko was okay. Chuck Norris tasted like a Doritos. Even though we didn't really like the rolls, all of the fish served was fresh!"
1,"I had lunch at Bon Chef Cafe on a Friday around 12:45.  There were only about 5 tables seated, so service was very quick.  One of the soups of the day was clam chowder, which the server spoke highly of, but I had to try the lobster bisque with the crust baked on top, as many yelpers noted it's fantastic.  It took over 10 minutes, but that's understandable since it has to bake.  I was not overly impressed with this dish, I would give it 3 or maybe even 2.5 stars.  It had about a half dozen chunks of lobster in it.  But, the crust was gooey around the side of the bowl where it came in contact with the soup.  This made it difficult to eat, you had to use your spoon as a knife in spots.  And, it was HOT.  Incredibly hot when it was brought out, and it hardly cooled throughout the meal.  Even at the end it had barely cooled enough to the point I could take a bite without blowing on it.  It had a nice broth to it and good flavor, but the temperature and gooey crust were hard to overcome.\n\nThe chicken quesadilla, on the other hand, was just about perfect.  It was a large serving, 4 good size pieces.  It comes with sour cream, quac, and pico.  I wish they sold the pico, it was perfect.  It was chunky, but the pieces of tomato and onion were VERY small.  The person that chopped the veggies is very talented, or the machine they used somehow didn't pulverize them.  The quesadillas had a nice crust on them, and the cheese was melted nicely.  They are packed with filling.  Definitely will order this again.\n\nThere is a small play area for kids that I saw some families enjoying, so that's nice if you have young children with you.\n\nLooks like they have a nice tapas happy hour on weekday afternoons.  I'll give it a shot some day..."
1,"Ahhhhh the irony! The gf and I woke up Labor Day, and we were gonna go for it. We were going for the Dick's!  Arrived at 11am, and it was busy, but we still got 2 seats right at the bar. sweet. Ordered Bloody Marys and our bartender gave us 2 little sidecars of DosXX. Wha? \""It's all about you, today,\"" and he smiled. So cool. We were tired, hungover, and this was such a nice bright touch to start our day.  \n\nTenderloin Benedict (medium rare) for me, Adovada for the lady. Clean plates: indeed!  I'm really a bitch about a good hollandaise and man, I have got to hand it to them, they do it proper. The adovada was saucy and totally hump-worthy.\n\nWhat a fantastic way to start off my Fall. This Kitty is a-purring!"

Perhaps most important, he was a good listener and was truly interested in learning and knowing what was important to us.\"" ~ Marty Moore"
0,This place is VERY messy and unorganized. The guy at front was often talking on the phone when I was standing at the front desk waiting for assistance. Lots of advertisement that he will make you a deal but in all reality he won't. Just about all his items are over priced. Maybe if he would make a deal with someone the prices would be reasonable. Also advertised items on Craigslist that he never had in the first place.  Overall not impressed or satisfied.
1,"We stayed here for two weeks in late March and early April 2014. We had a timeshare swap, that gave us a two bedroom unit, the second bedroom provided as a lock off or separate room. We had friends of ours staying with us as guests and this gave them plenty of privacy.\n\nFacilities here are good with a small but pleasant swimming pool. \n\nRoom was well equipped with a bath and shower in the main unit and a combined bath shower in the lock off. Kitchen was well equipped and everything worked and in good condition.\n\nLocation reasonably handy with a car and mono rail is within 5-10 minutes walk within the main LVH hotel. Good parking nothin the parking building and lot in front."
0,"I'm spoiled by the old location we had here in Surprise where the staff was fun, friendly, and on point. This location, the staff is indifferent, in a rush, and don't even make eye contact with you when you order. I really hate that. \n\nThe menu is the same and the food is good. But the staff is what really makes this location a 2 star joint. They really need to get a personality!"
1,"I took my mom with me to Carrabba's to celebrate a new job because it is her favorite restaurant. We were not disappointed.\n\nWhen I started to realize that we had been sitting for a few minutes without seeing a server, a manager walked over, apologized for the delay and took our appetizer and drink order. \n\nWe started with the delicious bread and then had crab cakes, that were oh-so-yummy. The drinks were delicious and the waiters were amusing. The atmosphere is casually Euro-hip and the open kitchen is always bustling with excitement. \n\nWhen my Spiedino Di Mare (shrimp, scallops and asparagus) arrived, I was a bit put off by the look of the plate. For about $20, I received a bland plate with soggy yellowing spears of asparagus, 4 medium sized scallops and 4 pieces of stuffed shrimp. Nevertheless, it smelled GREAT. \n\nI dove into the scallops immediately and they seemed to melt deliciously away on my tongue. The stuffed shrimp were had the same basic components - breaded and grilled with a generous lemon butter sauce to swim in.\n\nThe manager came over to check on us and I decided the asparagus wasn't too foul of a move since everything else was pleasant, so I didn't tell him. I'm surprised he didn't ask why I hadn't eaten any of the pitiful looking vegetable on the plate, however.\n\nThat being said, I love Carrabba's and will definitely be back!"
1,"I rarely come here, but its not my first or my last time. All the food here is a very reasonable price for a good portion. The pho got me full, but I will say that the banh mi is not exactly a filling meal, delicious though. Definitely coming back to try more!"
0,"I've been here twice, and the service sucked both times. The food is worse than the food. I really can't recommend this place at all, for the price, I would expect much better."
1,"As I've said before, I typically  don't  bother writing a review when there is already a voluminous set of other reviews stating everything I'd want to, and more concisely than I could... but Sakana is my favorite sushi bar in the valley, so I'm still going to add my two cents.\n\nI've never had a bad meal at Sakana. Even when busy, which seems to be more often than not as of late, the service is good, the prices are decent and the portions huge.\n\nRecently, they started having a Monday night happy hour-ish menu offering discounted maki rolls that include lettuce in the place of avocado. I've also seen promotions offering appetizers for 0.50 when you buy a Kirin or Kirin Light. Oh yeah, last but not least, you get orange slices with your bill... which is a nice touch."
0,Why does this place have 4 stars????? It's so slow!!! Are u kidding u took 15 mins for a Carmel frap?? And it taste like sh***t
0,Waited over 30 minutes to be seated. Ordered steaks. Not very good. Tough and chewy. Salad and bread were the best part of the meal. Will not be back.
0,"I have had this place bookmarked for a few months and we decided to do takeout last night.  I had high hopes based on a majority of reviews but was so disappointed.\n\nWe ordered;\n the White Pizza ( mozzarella, ricotta, and parmesan cheeses with fresh saut\u00e9ed spinach and garlic).  It looked very appetizing but to me it had no distinctive flavor and seemed bland.  The crust was nice.\n\nFresh Tomato, Basil and Garlic  Pizza  (Fresh sliced Roma tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fresh garlic and basil, topped with parmesan cheese).  Once again, the presentation was great but it was also on the bland side.  The crust was good.\n\nEggplant Parmigiana Dinner- (Layered eggplant with mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce).  It also came with a generous portion  of Fettuccine Alfredo (although there were other choices) and hot Italian bread.  The alfredo sauce had a weird (not bad-just weird) aroma but it was tasty.  \n\nMy husband liked the alfredo & Eggplant Parm much better then the pizza. He thought the pizza was good but nowhere near Amore's (his fave). \n\nThere is too many other places to get pizza and Italian food in our area so I doubt we would return but I think the potential is there.  Maybe it was just an off night."
0,"I have come to the fright dome event in the past and had an excellent time, so this year we decided to go once again. Fright Dome has unfortunately become an overcrowded money scheme. \n\nGeneral admission is $32-37 and almost double for a \""fast pass\"". Without a \""fast pass\"" we were unable to go in to the latest haunted house and waited over an hour and a half for the roller coaster. From 7pm to midnight we made it on a total of 3 rides and 1 haunted house. In previous years I was able to enjoy more than double that.\n\nThe quality of the environment, exhibits and actors took a dive this year. Fog machines were over used and actors were under rehearsed. In previous years I would have considered this a must go to in October and given a 4 to 5 star rating. This year it was not worth going to and was frustrating with how over crowded it was. \n\nThe value was not there this year. Purchasing a \""fast pass\"" would have left me feeling even more cheated. It seemed like the general admission allure was there only to up sell guests to a \""fast pass\"", which was a lackluster value with how many guests had bought one. All the vendors were overpriced and offered less selection than previous years.\n\nThe crowds were unorganized and the staff did not seem to have any control. This event seemed like a no rules apply high school public groping session. No supervision, which was to be expected, but no security or staff to monitor the fights.\n\nOverall, extremely disappointed this year. I'm going to pass on this event in the future. I would not recommend going to Fright Dome this year."
0,"RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION RATHER THAN GET INTO A NELLIS TAXI. Especially operator 585-middle aged white male.  After spending a memorable three day stay at Mandalay Bay-2 or 3 blocks from the airport, we stepped into a Nellis taxi. The first clue was he headed North up the strip, Mandalay is at the South end and we only needed to go East about two blocks. He said that he didn't know the street by the Tropicana was closed and he had to travel to the end of the strip. We explained that our flight was leaving at 6 am and we needed to be at Terminal 3 for United by 5:15am. He picked us up at 4:45am. He circled through Terminal 1 twice, pulling up behind cars that were unloading. Again, we explained that we had only minutes to get to Terminal 3 and to get into the far left lane to pass through Terminal 1. We had to get out and ask someone at luggage check in to find out where Terminal 3 was. At this point we sat behind the driver rather than the back of the van so we could  read the traffic signs. On the third pass he bypassed the Terminal 3 sign and we were leaving the grounds of the airport. We asked why are you doing this to us. We didn't offend him... we were going to miss our flight. He said that he was going to turn off his meter, but he didn't.  Finally, I saw a sign that said take a left to rental car drop off. I said to take us there because a shuttle could get us to the airport. Again, instead of making the turn to the rental car drop off he went straight down a deserted road. Now, I am not one to drop the F bomb especially directing it to someone but clearly OPERATOR 585 was effen us. Not only was he racking up charges we were going to miss our flight back to the East Coast. After screaming and demanding that he back up and make the turn to the  rental car depot he did so. Security came over and we explained what he did to us. At this point it was 5:30am, we knew that we had to call the police but we needed to make this flight. OPERATOR 585 was going to pull away with our luggage still in his cab. We got our luggage and got into another cab. We arrived at 5:40 am to the airport. The United staff assisted us through the airport and we made our flight. When we made it home I called Nellis and spoke to Dave. He explained that the driver was new. REALLY. I am not from Las Vegas and could read traffic signs and could have made it to Terminal 3. He asked if we paid the driver. We did, we threw $20. on the ground. Dave said that's good because the driver will have to make up the difference. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? That is not what I am looking for. I was told to call the transit authority and am pressing charges.  I called Mandalay Bay to forewarn them of our experience and protect their guests from stepping into this taxi. Hopefully I will meet others that care enough and will help me stop Operator 585 Nellis Taxi from picking up any customers"
0,"THE PHARMACY IS HORRIBLE!!!\nI've been there twice in the last week and a half and I don't know why I even try anymore. I brought a rx to be filled at 6:30 and was told it wouldn't be filled until the next day because they're too backed up. This happened both times. The Wal-Mart on Ocotillo can fill them in less than an hour, it's a long drive for me, but worth it. Even better yet, GO TO WALGREEN'S instead!"
0,"I had a terrible experience here! The bouncers were extremely rude and disrespectful in every possible way. They physically & verbally harassed a friend of mine for being \""too ugly\"" to be let in & then escorted her out by carrying her and passing her along to other body guards then dropped on the street! SO UNPROFESSIONAL. Perhaps the shows are great and the building is an artsy lit up warehouse, but this establishment has no respect for their customers and is in a sketchy area of time. Honestly don't waste your money here!"
0,We just had dinner and had the chicken cranberry salad....... a regular for us and very good. Decided to try a different panini...usually get the chipotle chicken. I wanted to try something new...the chicken mushroom on french. The only problem was they had no MUSHROOMS. This in turn eliminated about all the sandwiches. I decided to try the flat bread tomato basil which is a pizza. This had to be the worst pizza I had ever tasted. Awful tomato paste instead of sauce and no basil. Stick with the salads and I hear the coffee is good too
1,"From the minute I walked in, this place was amazing.  I had a sinus infection, and it was getting worse by the minute.  I really needed medicine fast.  They got me in and out with medicine in a little under 45 minutes.  Service was fantastic.  I wish I could remember the name of the P.A., but I can not.  She was so helpful:) Thank you!!!"
1,"First I would like to thank Ian who helped with our reservation at the Best Western Plus in Goodyear AZ. He was EXCEPTIONAL!!!!  And very caring!!  We had a very bad experience at the Holiday Inn express in Goodyear AZ. And decided to cancel our reservation and go else where. But when we stayed at the Best Western Plus, It was the Best hospitality I have ever experienced. The staff was so friendly and caring. The rooms were great and the bed was so comfy, I slept in. I'm usually a morning person. They offer a hot breakfast in the morning. I didn't get to experience cuz I slept in. But I'm sure it was great.  I travel alot and rate my stays and I gave this a 5 star.  I will be back and I recommend this place. Also,  the girls at the front desk was so nice and caring. One was a trainee and the other was training her and still demonstrated great hospitality.  Thank you Kylie and Desiree! Because of your caring personality we will be back."
1,"I went to the zoo this fall and really enjoyed it. The tiger enclosure, with the window where the tiger can walk right up to you, is fantastic. \n\nI also really love the penguins. They swim right up to the glass, which seems to really thrill the kids, as well. And I swear, the penguins can see out and will play with you, chasing your hand around if you waggle your fingers at them a bit.\n\nThe zoo is a nice size--large without being totally unwalkable--and makes a good day trip. The aquarium is also really nicely done and quite enjoyable."
0,"I didn't think this place was particularly healthy and was just trying to imitate burgers, tacos, etc. with vegetables and fruit. I was hoping for something a little more interesting and different."
1,"It had been years since I'd had Charley's, and up until recently, I'd thought the only Charley's was across the street from Paradise Valley Mall. \n\nAnywho, they're known for being the anti-Subway. If you want healthy food, go elsewhere. Preferably far away from me. Charley's brings the meat and cheese, and all of the accompanying grease and future heart trouble that accompanies it. Those like myself who possess the metabolism of a hummingbird on crystal meth will eat it all the same. \n\nI have to confess to having only tried two of their sandwiches. I have a routine going whereby I resolve to 'try something new'.. only to be immediately distracted by how utterly delicious the Philly Cheese Steak looks and ultimately going with that. \n\nOne day I did manage to shake myself out of that beef-fueled stupor long enough to get their buffalo chicken sandwich and I must say.. it was absolutely delicious. They're just good on every level, if a bit pricey. Their fries, though, are nice and cheap. You can buy chicken bacon ranch fries (if that's your thing) for a little under 2 dollars. \n\nThe negative? Their drinks are microscopic. They might as well not even give you one. I've seen sippy cups larger than their 'regular' drinks. All the same, it really is surprising to see such a high quality sandwich shop inside Chris Town. Just one of many welcome surprises I discovered during my recent visit there."
0,"Ugh, after seeing this place on Tanked I had decided to check it out, bleh what a waste of time and money, the food was horrible and the service was worse. Our waiter kept checking on the table next to us and we were forgotten. The person who brought us our food just slammed it down and walked off as if we were bothering him from doing something more important. Then we had asked to speak to the manager and he didn't give a rats ass either. I do not recommend this place at all. We went on Saturday the 25th."
0,"Inconsistent.  I ate there two nights in a row last week, and there couldn't have been a greater difference in food quality and service.  Friday night was great, a party of 6 taking advantage of the free corkage policy, and having multiple courses per person.  The service was so good, you really didn't notice it after placing your order.  T-bone steak was delicious.\n\nSaturday was a train wreck.  Service was poor and neglectful, with some personnel poorly groomed.  Cadaveric managers hovered around the tables, but did little to help staff.  The corkage policy abruptly changed, costing us more.  Lamb chops were unseasoned as far as I could tell.\n\nMy advice, look elsewhere.  For this amount of money, you should be sure you are going to have a good experience."
1,Great place!  Check in online or on your phone for quicker service!  Wait times listed when u check in so you know before u go! Staff is friendly and nice.  Will definitely come back.
0,If I could give this less than 1 star I would. Service was terrible. They were out of a bunch of different foods. How do you run out of rice?! The waiter couldn't care less. Dirty silverware. Total lack of caring by any of the employees. Took forever to get bread. Didn't get our drink order right...4 waters. Really? Avoid this place. Worst dining experience I've had in Madison...
1,It was wonderful.  It's not cheap but they are not cheap on the serving sizes and quality.  I think I was over served with some great food.
0,"They should call this place Yuppies Cove. The eating area is dark and unwelcoming, both times I went the woman behind the counter was extremely unfriendly,  the prices are way to high even for Mill and to top it off, the food sucks. Also, no one working there seemed to care about the fly that was buzzing around  the open food containers, helping himself to a free lunch. No one except me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not a snob, I eat at crusty looking establishments and as long as the food is good and the place appears to be marginally clean I am a happy camper! But  the food doesn't lie. \n\nIf you want fake mexican, you would be better off going to a chain like Chipotle. At least they have vegetarian options.\n\nALSO, the2nd and last time I went I witnessed a man who works there snatch a cup of beer out of another persons hand and in the process dump said cup all over another patron. My vote is stay away."
0,"BARF BARF BARF\n\nQuite possibly the grossest food I have ever eaten.  The chicken lo mien was made with spam-ish meat product-- Does that make is Spamish meat product lo mien? I ended up eating just white rice and soy sauce with egg rolls--- can't mess up fried egg rolls right?  I did have to salt them though, they were pretty taste-less. \n\nThe ambiance is less than desirable as well, our plates never got cleared and the amount of unshowered people sitting near me made me want to go home and take a hot bath with all the soap in the world.  \n\nI will not return to Lim's and I suggest you not go either."
1,"Faith and her staff are friendly and professional! They explained every product they used and why they were using it. I loved that Faith was excited to do my color and even had some of her own ideas too. My color is beautiful, the cut is exactly what I wanted. I left with a complimentary hand massage, confidence and beautiful hair! What more can you ask for?"
1,"Yay for good skin exams!\n\nI admit I was a slacker for the past few years and didn't go for my annual full body check at the dermatologist.  Therefore, I was a little nervous about my appointment.  Not only did I have a few freckles / sun spots / moles that popped up over the years, but I had a baby too... and god knows what happens to your skin during a pregnancy and beyond!\n\nAnyways, I knew it was time for a visit, but I didn't have time to trek to North Phoenix to the sister office of Scottsdale Dermatology Ltd (see my review for that office here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenix-dermatology-ltd-phoenix#hrid:XPNvqTMH5MP_ME0Fem3Yrg), where I'd been before, so I trusted my husband on this one and called this location instead.  The woman that answered the phone was super friendly and scheduled an appointment for me to see Kendall Jenson, PA-C the following week.  \n\nWhen the time came for my appointment, I followed the directions to this office on my Yelp app, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how close it was to where I live and work, and there was plenty of shaded street parking when I arrived... bonus!\n\nI didn't have to wait too long once I arrived, and I had a good experience.  Luckily, Kendall was not too concerned about any of my freckles/sun spots/ moles, and he answered all of the questions I had for him.  Before I left, they had me self address a post card that they will send to me for my annual visit next year... hopefully, I'll keep up with my annual appointments going forward.  Now that I have a dermatologist nearby, I really have no excuses.  What's yours?!"
0,"Walking down Fremont street I spot a sign .....\nCabo Wabo margarita with a shot of tequila in a commemorative glass - keep the shot glass\nSounds like it is right up my alley\nFound out it was only available during happy hour - so I happily planned to enjoy happy hour the next day.\n\nI show up at the appointed hour and wait for some service at my table.\nThe area is not overcrowded with the other 7 people in the place.\nAfter no service shows, I go up to the bar ... ready to drink.\n\nI am informed that they now longer have the shot glass for the special, but would I be interested in another of their fine margaritas.\n\"" We sold more than 1200 of the specials.\""\nLooking around at the emptiness I thought perhaps the special actually brought some real business here.\n\nDo they not think it might be a good idea to order some additional glasses to enhance the number of customers ????\n\nI asked why is the sign still up - if you can't get the special ....\nI'm not sure I got an answer, but I did find out once again that they sold more than 1200 of the specials.\nI informed the bartender that that did not do much for me.\n\nAll in all - poor service and a classic bait and switch -  \n\""we don't have that ....  but can I interest you in .....\"" \n\nI think they specialize in \""Sad hours\"" ... not \""Happy Hours.\""\nEnter at your own risk."
0,"Not thrilled and not going back.  Met a fellow church member there to discuss an upcoming event and decided we'd meet over breakfast.\n\nWaitress came by for drink orders.  I ordered iced tea and water, my friend ordered coffee and water.  Drinks came quick but no ice in the water.  They provided a full carafe for my friend though.\n\nNow, for the food.  The toast was good.  But that's it.  The two strips of bacon were cheap.  Bottom of the barrel type bacon.  Not the good, thick cut bacon.  The hashbrowns were off as well.  Too much butter or oil made them soggy.  But the worst part was the scrambled eggs.  They are obviously not made to order.  This tells me they make them up dozens at a time and let them sit.  The coloring was horrible and the eggs were filled with very hard chunks of \""egg\"".  Couldn't even eat them."
1,"I'm stupid when it comes cupid.  I love this place.   I bought some candles, soaps and a cool magnet for my refrigerator.  Excellent Service!  I'LL BE BACK!"
1,"I love this place and I go here A LOT but that doesn't mean it is good, it is just comforting I suppose. I don't generally go late night or when I am drunk. Mostly lunch dates.\nService: I have been coming here since 2008ish and it has slowly just gotten worse over time. The wait staff is always rushing you. I think it is ridiculous to be asked 4 times by the same time if you are ready to order within a 7 minute span. It makes you feel like \""Hey we don't want to satisfy you, we just want your money and for you to leave.\"" We got our food and halfway through our meal a lady came over and gave us our check, said thank you, and asked us are we done? My friend and I were both literally sitting with utensils in hand and half eaten plates of food. \""No... We aren't\"" I commented to my friend under my breath about how rude that was and she must've heard because she came back and took the check away. It has been feeling this rushed since they underwent their makeover a while ago.\nFood: the pho is delicious, all the rice noodle/egg roll combination dishes are amazing. I mean I would walk on hot coals if their egg rolls were waiting for me on the other side. I have never had an issue with any food being bad. But I love their calamari and sometimes it is amazing and sometimes, well, it is just deep fried squid.\nCheck it out and decide for yourself.\nThe egg rolls are the only thing that stop me from giving it 3 stars."
1,"I have been taking my cat Jarvis to this emergency hospital for every emergency visit he has had. The first one was a bleach poisoning, he had gotten into some clothes my sister had soaking in her bathroom.\n\nI was in hysterics when I got him to the ER. He had thrown up a little in the car ride over, and was okay otherwise. I explained I was really low on money, and the managed to check him over and decided he could be seen as a non emergency to help me out. The whole visit cost 75.00 including medications. Reasonably priced. The second visit he had broken a tone nail. They price was about 180.00, by the time we where done but the doctors where really nice, and answered all of my questions, ( I HAD ALOT LOL ) and he was fine after coming home. They trimmed the nail up, got him some pain medications, and antibiotics. The nail had been broken for about two days and I had been trying to treat it at home - which was not working. He likes to ruffhouse with the other cat and kept splitting the nail worse. :(\n\nThey where awesome and I would recommend them to anyone! They also have a regular vet on site. :)"
0,"This place was horrid, what was to be 2-3 hrs was 5-6hrs & when you're on vacation, time is of the essence. We had a sales guy who understood that we had to get going after breakfast, could we please look at place and go? He said \""too bad, there are procedures to follow and you have to expect this\"". We explained that we had family event, still nothing. He had us sitting to meet his manager, said he would try to hurry it along. My daughter went near them & listened, they were discussing sports! He knew we were in a hurry and purposefully delayed us. \n\nWhen I refused to shake the manager's hand - he called ME rude & the salesguy said \""Well you aren't buying anyway, so whatever\"" - um, I had enough money to buy a suite OUTRIGHT, but they were suck dicks that I would NEVER recommend dealing with them, nevermind buying anything from them. \n\nBAD BAD BAD!"
0,"RUN FAR FAR AWAY! TERRIBLE!  If I could give negative stars, I would. I ordered a pizza, the BOY answers the phone in a hurry, didn't ask how I was going to pay, didn't take my credit card info, didn't verify my phone number, told me it would be 15-20 minutes, I asked if he needed further directions for the driver b/c its in an apt- he said no, AND told me it would be $15.90-something. The delivery driver ended up getting lost b/c the guy had the wrong address, 42 minutes later the driver arrives after I gave him directions, he expected cash which I did not have. I wanted to pay with my card. The driver left the pizza with me and goes back to the store. The \""manager\"" calls and wants payment; I have no problem with that, BUT when I told him what all happened, he TOTALLY froze stuttered his words and was completely USELESS! Its absolutely pathetic that this KID is a manager. Its like Fisher Price opened a pizza shop and hired him. He has NO idea how to talk to someone.  OH! and he gave me the wrong # to corporate... coincidence? --- and my pizza was cold. ugh. \nHarold, the delivery guy, was super awesome guy. He owned up to the mistake, apologized, offered excellent customer service even though it wasn't his mistake. Nice job Harold! \nNow waiting on a call back from corporate and the district manager. \nDear Donavan, Your management skills, or lack they're of, are some of the worst I've ever experienced. I would almost rather pay your college tuition than for you to ever handle an adult situation again. Don't ever EVER lie to a customer. You will always get caught... sorry had to call your corporate on ya. Shouldn't have done that, sir. CHEERS."

1,"Offering a sizable length of rope is a dangerous thing, especially when a high percentage of your clientele will hang themselves with it. At Burger Bar, the rope is a massive number of options for each and every component of your burger. That's thousands of burger permutations, many of which are truly awful. \n\nVegas is great for people watching and Burger Bar is great for burger watching: take note as Lance from Des Moines constructs his demon spawn burger and then complains about the resulting assault on his palette. \n\nYou'll also notice those deer-in-the-headlights expressions when patrons first get a look at the number of menu offerings. The Burger Bar staff will not jump-in with recommendations. Do not be surprised by this. They don't eat there. It is just not possible. They're all amazing fit. \n\nAnyway, 5 stars for this combo:\n*  1/2 pound Angus Beef, medium rare\n* Whole Wheat bun\n* Saut\u00e9ed Mushrooms\n* Caramelized Onions\n* Blue Cheese\n\nThe Burger Bar beer menu is huge with many beers on tap, so pair your burger with a cold one and some thick cut fries."
1,"Dining at Hyde Park, overall, was a great experience! We came on Sunday when they have less expensive meal options. We had bacon wrapped scallops for and app which I would highly recommend.  For my dinner portion, I had the salmon which was delicious and a huge portion.  All the men in our party order steaks and they all raved over them.  Dessert we order keylime pie and carrot cake.  The keylime pie was delicious and meant for 1 person.  The carrot cake on the other hand was huge more like a half of carrot cake. The menu said good for 2-4 people but we shared it was 5 and still had left overs!"
1,"Yep - I'm a fan. Any place that sends me a daily email with a new SALE for the day/week gets my vote. Is it a custom suit or Nordstroms quality? No. But it doesn't try to be either. Good quality and a great price...period. My favorites are the Signature suits; travelers non-iron shirt; cuff links and their sweaters. Great place to shop for the following...yourself; husband or Dad/Grandpa. It's a chain, some better than others. Sales people aren't that knowledgable, but better than Mens Warehouse IMO. They're located across the country and the odds that one is located withing 15 miles of wherever you are is high!"
1,"I went for brunch for two times, and really enjoyed their food and seating.  Omelets are so good. If the weather is not so hot, you can just sit outside chilling with your friends by the street side. Now whenever i feel like a brunch, Ncounter just pops up in my head. Love it!"
1,"Pros: walking distance from the crib. One of the few places you can get Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar. And in 24 oz big-boy bottles, too. w00t! Unparalleled beer selection. Barstaff that is just this side of surly. Local art that is (usually) pretty good.\n\nCons: Umm, not open for breakfast? Can't really think of any.\n\nNow go drink some beer."
1,"Without a doubt, Bartolotta was an experience but you MUST be a seafood lover! I came here with a client and opted for the Top Chef tasting menu, which we enjoyed tremendously. Our table had a nice water view that added nicely to the ambiance. \n\nUnlike some expensive restaurants which give you tiny portions, the multiple courses were extremely filling and the fresh seafood did not disappoint. The presentation was flawless, service was impressive, and the overall meal was memorable. \n\nWe got to try the famous langoustine, which apparently only 12 restaurants in the world have flown in live (and Bartolotta is obviously one of them). They were sweet and well cooked. \n\nThe Top Chef tasting menu had a variety of pasta, seafood, risotto, and ended with the biggest pesce al sale profumato (fish course) I've ever seen! It was truly an impressive speciman of fish, coated in salt and lemon seasonings. They de-boned it table side and serve just the moist filet. We were all so full, but still managed to eat a fair amount. \n\nIt was a pricey meal ($750 for 3 of us) but we did choose the most expensive tasting menu and overall, I would say it was worth it for the elegant presentation and wonderful meal!"
0,"Visited today for lunch... there were 7 of us.  The food was just okay.  I had a truffle burger and we all shared side items including French Fries (shoestring fries that are HORRIBLE and cold), a house pickle plate that includes a variety of pickled items (carrots, mushrooms, beets, etc., also YUCK), and were supposed to share a plate of fried pickles which were forgotten and never brought to the table.  Aside from the crappy food, soda is served by the bottle (so be prepared to shell out $3 for each 12 oz bottle you drink).... and the real clincher: on top of the 20% gratuity they automatically added to the bill, they added AN EXTRA 20% SERVICE CHARGE simply for being a party of 6 or more.  Nope, sorry... never again!  Good luck surviving in SLS where the hotel smell alone made me want to vomit!"
0,I tried the coupon from groupon for $42 for two persons. The food was not that good there tempura was small and the tempura sauce is lacking of taste. The choices is limited in the coupon but it a good saving because the price is a bit high.\n\nWe went around 6pm and you can see the chairs are dusty maybe its best to go at night when its dark so you can appreciate the place. Hibachi might be their specialty because the regular food wasn't that good for an expensive price. I like their cold green tea though!
0,Everything is just okay--no great shakes.  the worst overwhelming smell of tobacco ever!!  the apathy and lack of customer service ethic of the front desk staff--never saw concierge on duty--contribute to my unwillingness to rate this higher than a 2.
1,"Eating here was the gastronomic highlight of our family Vegas trip, and Bouchon did not disappoint.  \n\nThe opening bread was warm, soft, and crunchy and the butter was sweet.  For starters, we had the special pork belly and the salmon rillette.  The pork belly melted in your mouth.  The rillette was served in a jar; the waiter scooped out the clarified butter off the top that sealed in the flavor of the salmon.  It was served with some toasted bread and went well with the tableside pot of mustard that is typical of a classic French bistro.\n\nFor entrees, we enjoyed the Beef Bourguignon and the Leg of Lamb.  The Bourguignon smelled and tasted great and was fork tender.  The Leg of Lamb was sliced thin and delivered a perfect medium rare and had a delicious au jus.\n\nFor dessert, we enjoyed the three Bouchon brownies with ice cream.  \n\nService and atmosphere were excellent.  The room had mirrors and tiled floors to remind you of Paris.  We came with our 2 daughters (ages 7 and 10) and they enjoyed the Macaroni au Gratin (mild cheese and good for the young pallet) and the Croque Madame, which had a fried egg on top of buttery toasted bread that sandwiched in tasty ham and cheese.\n\nOverall, a great experience.  I love bistro food and always seek it out whenever I travel.  This is as close as I'll get to Thomas Keller's French Laundry or Per Se for a few years, and it lived up to my expectations."
1,This boutique was one of my absolute favorites! I used to always shop here when I was trying to find a cute outfit for a special night out.  I was so sad to see the actual store front close.  Although I guess they are still online- that seems to be the direction many clothing stores are headed right now.  \n\nI think the Hilton Village is doing a complete remodel because many of the stores there are all closed right now.  \n\nI did find out that their other location Sherre's up in Cave Creek is still open so I will continue shopping there!
0,"This salon is a hit or miss.\nI recieved a *Full Set for the price of $22. Not bad, a reasonable price as well.\nBut upon my visit I felt rushed. Being a customer I feel it's not right to feel rushed because it then makes me think you are not going to get the job right or care about my service. \nAlso the Acrylic she used did not meet all the way to my cuticle, which made my new full set look like my nails were already growing out. I especially hated this.\nThe woman also charged me an extra $2.00 for glitter nailpolish. It was only nailpolish nothing fancy at all.\nThey also charge *$10.00 extra for gel. Wow.\n\nI'd come here again. But I'll definetly tell the woman to put the Acrylic all the way to my cuticle. And I'll make sure to bring my own glitter nailpolish.\n\nOther than that, I'd wish they were also aware of many of the Nail Trends out here today. If anyone knows of any Salons that are aware of this please feel free to inform me."
0,"I really, really tried to like this place but it's just not consistent. This morning was the straw that broke the camels back... Let me paint you a picture.\n\n It's 6 am, your two year old woke up hungry and, you'll never guess, demanding. Buzzberry is a quick option. You order oatmeal for the boy & soy latte for you, but make a point to have it CHILDS HOT. Both come out steaming like it was cooked in a crematory. After 5 minutes of blowing on it, you ask for ice. 6 ice cubes later you assume it's ok. Your little one tries it and all hell breaks lose; oatmeal spit everywhere, crying, screaming, trying to do everything to keep it from burning his tongue. (Keep in mind you did test it but underneath was still hot.) Frustrated, you ask for a bag and voice the fact nothing was what you specifically asked for... You get a blank look. Not we'll fix it or I'm sorry. So, your kids bent out of shape in tears & your $6 latte is watered down in ice with generic sugar... Awesome start of the day!\n\nYou only hope the look that you gave the guy who said \""have a good day\"" as leaving will haunt him in his sleep. \n\nNow that being said, there are two pleasant girls that work drive-thru mid day. I appreciate their genuine hospitality. One is a younger brunette & a blonde (I really need to work on my name remembering skills) \n\nDon't recommend the shakes, go to one-stop nutrition\nDo recommend the coffee cake or blueberry muffins. But sad to say I'll never be back."
1,"Hit this place up on a weekend trip to PA. First off, let me explain that up until 1996, this place was a church and a beautiful one at that. Even though they brew their own been on the former alter, store their liquor in the old confessionals, and make their pizza pies where the old organ used to play, they kept all the stained glass, high ceilings, and rose window from this place. While I did feel somewhat sinful eating and drinking there, my experience here was excellent. \n\nWe had been drinking all day, so that did not stop there. Nice mix of homemade beers from pilsner to stout. GF ordered a french onion soup that was delicious. Table ordered a white pizza with chicken and spinach which was decent. Customer service was excellent here. I joked with the server that for working at a place like this, her penance would be that she had to carry around the extra heavy menus. She agreed on commented how it was tough with 10 toppers. The mgr, Phil, saw I was wearing a Chicago Bears shirt and start making fun of it with another employee. Of course, I started jawing back and forth with him. He came over to the table and was very friendly. He comped a round of drinks and I asked him where I could buy some of their pint glasses (see photo, glass says on the 8th day man created beer). He came back with 4 glasses for our table on the house. Saved me the trouble of having to steal them. haha. \n\nIf you can get past the place that this place used to be a church, you are in for a treat at this place. I would recommend it to all."
0,"This was my first time eating here. The food was delicious, but it was a very small serving size for a 1/2 sandwich. I got the 1/2 turkey and Brie sandwich and cup of asparagus, leek and spinach soup. The 1/2 sandwich was smaller than my phone at about 3 inches long.  The price was $6.59 for such a small serving. While delicious, it was not worth it. I won't be back."
0,"Pros\n- Tasty appetizers\n- Creative and balance martinis\n\nCons\n- Way too pricey\n- Snooty wait staff\n\nMy waiter acted like he was doing me a favour serving me. Everything came with a sigh and a face. Regardless of the food and drink, I won't go back because I simply didn't feel welcomed there. My friends and I wanted to continue our night so we just crossed the parking lot to Jack Astor's, where we felt the staff were happy to have our business."
1,"Located inside the Shops at the Forum/Caesar's Palace, a beautiful place to shop, window shop, or just walk around for the ambience.  Spago Las Vegas is a lot more fun and less \""stuffy\"" than Spago Beverly Hills.  Helpful, friendly, attentive staff from the moment you walk in the doors.  Great wine selection.  Beautiful culinary presentation.  Delicious food."
1,Right down the street.  I needed a fast battery for my car and they were quick and friendly.  Great job.
0,"My husband and I made dinner reservations for Gordon Ramsay's Pub with high expectations.  My God, after watching KN & HK, you'd expect nothing but the best.  Unfortunately, we were sadly disappointed.  We were there at 6:00 on a Monday night for dinner.  The place was nearly empty.  So whom do they sit next to us, when there are dozens of open seats everywhere?  A table of 4 loud drunks.  The server came up to us immediately, but that was the high point of the evening.\n\nWe ordered fish & chips and prime rib, both of which also came to us immediately.  My fish was cold, my fries were cold and greasy, my husband's prime rib was nothing special.  His vegetables were cold and mushy; his mashed potatoes cold and tasteless.  When we questioned the server, he said that the fish & chips were made \""only\"" 5-10 minutes before our order.  If he admits to 5-10 minutes, I bet on at least 30.  I thought that Gordon's restaurants always made dinners to order -- at least something as traditional and simple as fish & chips.  How can you screw that up?\n\nBesides that, the place just doesn't feel and look clean.  The silverware is put right on the table, which in our case was covered with sprinkled salt, a sure sign that the table had not been cleaned between diners.  The uniforms of the servers were wrinkled and mismatched.  I'm not sure what look Gordon was seeking, but the servers clearly do not have the same \""vision\"".\n\nWhen we complained to the manager, he was dismissive and condescending, making sure to inform us that \""Gordon had just been there last week and everything was great\"".  Well maybe great when the boss is around, but with zero or no quality standards when he is not.\n\nBottom Line: Save your money for fish fries at your local Catholic church during Lent.  Gordon's made enough money from hard-working \""no counts\"" like us."
1,Great experience here with a speedy tire rotation!! Manager today also got everyone in the waiting room bottled water. Thanks for getting me in and out to pick up my daughter on time. Been coming here for years! Thank You!!!
0,"The first time I came here it was great. The last time I came here the staff made me feel like crap. The manager was persistent I order food, even after I bought a drink. He asked me to order something or I would be kicked out. He even shoved a menu onto my table even after I told him I did not want to order food. I was just hanging out enjoying my drink. It's definitely not a place to hangout unless you are going to buy food apparently. Not cool. I will never go to Hob Nobs again. It should change its name to Hob Snobs. \n\nP.S. Their music sucks."
0,"We turned to Greyhound to get from Phoenix to Tucson. We were going to rent a car, but picking up in Phoenix and dropping off in Tucson for 5 days was over $600 at one of the cheaper rental car agencies. That seemed crazy, so we bought one-way tickets on Greyhound for 3 passengers for about $40. \n\nWas there a better deal online? Interestingly enough, the internet special costs more. \n\nWould we save money on our tickets if we purchased ahead? No, but Mr. L bought our tickets a week ahead anyway, since the 2:30pm Sunday bus was the only time that actually worked for us. He printed out our tickets, which said we were confirmed. That Sunday would be Daylight Savings, but it was Arizona, which didn't have a time change.\n\nThat Sunday when we showed up at 2pm for our 2:30pm bus, we learned that they'd changed the time to 1:30pm. The Daylight Savings in other states affected the schedule. We should have confirmed our \""confirmed\"" tickets. The station agent changed us to a 5:30pm bus, and we were bummed that we'd have a few hours to kill and miss out on time with Mr. L's parents. And they'd have to find the bus station in the dark - shoot.\n\nLesson learned? Buying tickets ahead with Greyhound isn't the best idea. If you do, confirm them, as the schedule may change.\n\nWith hours to kill in the Greyhound Station, my son started playing video games at $1 a pop, and Mr. L and I gathered our thoughts. There was some scary looking food sitting under heat lamps in the Cactus Caf\u00e9. We rented two lockers to stow our luggage for $3 each for 3 hours and split in a cab for a while to go anywhere but the bus station.\n\nWhen we returned closer to our new departure time, the lines for the buses were confusing. The line for Tucson was not the line for our bus. It seemed like everything was backwards here. Luckily we asked, or we might've missed our bus again. By the time we boarded our bus, many seats were taken. Ichabod headed to the back of the bus, and a kind gentleman cleared the 3-seat rear spot for us. \n\nThere was a bathroom near the back, which Mr. L suggested I avoid entering. He said it was a basic hole (outhouse style) with an empty jar of hand-sanitizer. Good to have the bare-bones bathroom if you really need it, but ick.\n\nThe driver made a bunch of announcements in English, then in Spanish. He meant business. I was glad when he told passengers to use headsets for their music, since initially a nearby passenger graced us with his music. Now we only got to see his seated dance moves, which were actually pretty good. \n\n+2 affordable prices\n+2 capable driver\n-2 changing the schedule after had a \""confirmed\"" ticket\n-1 for only one agent working the line \n+2 having a bathroom on bus\n-1 condition of bathroom\n+1 lockers in Greyhound station\n-1 for the clusterf*ck of confusion of lines to get on buses - advanced degrees don't help here, be ready to ask questions\n\nGrand total: 2 stars\n\nOverall, we were glad not to spend over $600 on a rental car or inconvenience our friends or family by asking for a very long ride. We learned that we need to confirm or buy tickets last-minute like most Greyhound riders. Hanging out in a Greyhound station is not my idea of fun. We would ride Greyhound again, but proceed with caution."
1,"Originally I rated this club 5 stars but now it's a 4. I asked one of their promoters to place me on the guestlist a week in advance for a major event/weekend (not going to blast her name even though I should). I confirmed with her more than once leading up to the day to assure that we would be good to go. We waited in the guestlist line and when we went to check in with the guestlist moderator, she said they were only accepting names from the corporate guestlist and that I wasn't on it. I called my promoter and she did not answer the phone. It would've been nice for the promoters to have informed us of this beforehand as well as the line moderators. Had I known they were only doing corporate when we first entered the line, it would've still been early enough in the evening to find somewhere else to go. There were hundreds on guestlist and even guests who had reserved TABLES that were turned away. I was so, so disappointed! This is still my favorite club for right now but I'll definitely never come here on an event night again. Nobody seemed to know what they were talking about. I honestly believe I was turned away because of a ratio situation."
1,Best in the business! Vic was very professional and did a great job with a very difficult install! Thanks Vic and Mobile Masters!!
0,"Simple Pros & Cons:\n\nPros:\nGood Location if you're close\n\nCons:\nExtremely unprofessional and rude staff (3 of 3 times I went)\nBy appt were behind in schedule even in the morning - attendance?\n\nPlace was like mid 60s or below, people were staring at each other with fear when AC woudl turn on, while it's 100 outside. \n\nWithout appointment I waited for over an hour then asked staff when might I be finally taken in approximately and was told, \""I don't know\"", so I finally left. \n\nIn Sum - Unless you want mental abuse from the staff, waste of time for the wait, and flu from other people and mid-low 60s freeze, go to the \""normal\"" Summerlin Labcorp, if even a little drive more."
0,"Under-humidified, outrageously overpriced; dried out cigars, and a ditzy blond helper trying to push 12 dollar Padrons on me for about 45 bucks.  I can handle an exorbitant price for a stogy every once in a while, and I can handle weirdo store help in almost any fashion, but to try to enjoy a cigar or two that is as dry as the Nevada desert, that will subjugate this place to single star category.\n\nBy the way, when a customer inquires how you measure (and regulate!) your humidity levels when your humidistat (humidity gauge) wasn't working, please come up with a better answer than \""I have no idea\"".  You work there so you should have a reasonably good idea when you're selling 5 dollar Romeo & Juliets for 17 dollars.  Horrible little shop on first visit, I can not recommend."
0,"It's was 12:00am in the morning, there was about 4 tables seated and one server. We waited about 20 minute before being seated, then about another 40 minute before the waitress came and ask for our order. \n\nThen my sister's boyfriend had a question about something on the menu,then the waitress said she didn't have time to answer his question as she was busy serving other diners and left us.\n\nAfter about another 10 minute of waiting for her to come back, we decided to do her a favor and leave as she was indeed busy.\n\nWhether or not the food is good we wouldn't know, it's not really the waitress fault but, the restaurant should consider hiring another person to help out as well. : /"
0,"Oh god, where to begin...\n\nEveryone else here has been complaining about the room reservation system. It's utterly stupid. They don't guarantee you getting 2 queens if you ask for them, even though we made reservations over a month ago. They also treat you like shit when you try to express your dissatisfaction with THEIR utter lack of service. We were unable to reach the front desk with our phones for 3 entire days. We got fed up with being on hold for over 30 minutes each time so we just went downstairs to (attempt to) get some service. \n\nThis place is totally uninspired and the service was just atrocious. I wish I stayed at Planet Hollywood instead, they actually treat you like they want you there."
0,"this place used to be fun, now all you get us over priced drinks that are watered down and poor service. I definitely won't be back."
1,"What begins in chaos usually ends in chaos.. I'm pretty sure that quote was referring to spicy food but I digress.\n\nI personally enjoy any opportunity to find my way downtown and more importantly to try new eateries.  Le Thai has been on my list for a while.\n\nEnthusiastic and hungry we approached the hostess stand only to be told there was a 60-minute wait *insert pouty face here*. No problem, we killed time next door until our seats were ready.\n\nI must have looked unusually disappointed or totally starving because not even 15 minutes later we were being paged that our seats were ready! SCORE!\n\nAmbiance can be best described as a hole-in-the-wall reminiscent of most restaurants in NYC (or Chicago).  It's cool without being smug about it.  \n\nMost importantly the food: excellent portion sizes, bold flavors, spice level was right on point. Their spice chart is 1-4 and we went with 2's all across the board. My friend was sweating, my nose was running but man oh man was it worth it. \n\nI can recall Le Thai not taking reservations in the past, but since they do currently, I highly recommend taking that extra step in securing your seating. The hostess took pity on us THIS time, but to ensure you are seated in a reasonable fashion, make a res.\n\nLe Thai is something that should be on your list of \""to try\""."
1,"This is another great show to watch in las vegas. I had front row seats, I got wet.... Oh well. I think the highlight of the show is this machine that spins and its like doing dance breaking moves pretty cool.my eyes start to trip when I look at it for awhile. Its a must see show if you go to vegas..."
1,"Excellent in every aspect.  Had the White Fish platter, comes with 2 bagels, cream cheese,choice of salads,6 sliced tomatoes, capers, green and black olives, lettuce, pickle, etc.  Too much.. will be back without a doubt.  $16.95"
1,If you are reading the yelp for this place there is a significant chance you are drunk and coming here anyway. So what's left to say? \n\nAs difficult to find as delicious NY style pizza in the West. But you will find both and all will be golden. Best of luck on your quest!
1,"Our first time to the Orange Table was this morning.  We had a party of four with two children under 12 years of age.\n\nThe Buttermilk Pancakes were almost culinary perfection and we truly enjoyed the Green Flannel.  The chocolate chip pancakes were too sweet for my palette, though perfect for our young attendees.\n\nI enjoyed the lemonade, though it ran empty early in the meal; and was never refilled.  The service was typical of these \""alternative\"" styled restaurants; with their young, and aloof staffing.  In the morning, I sometimes like the fact that I'm left alone, and not rushed out-the-door.\n\nFood gets a 4...service gets a 4, given the style of the establishment.  Polished service may actually ruin the feel of the place..."
1,"I had very high expectations before watching this show because all my friends highly praised it. AND the show did not fail me! I loved the choreography, the stage and the costumes. My favorites are always the clowns, too adorable and funny. A must watch show in Vegas!"
0,"Underwhelming.\n\nThe M is a sleek place and everything is so beautifully done.  All of their eateries are so promising, but unfortunately always fail to deliver.  The layout and design of Terzetto is gorgeous and looks like something you'd find further North on the Strip.  Their menu is not uber creative, but it has the steakhouse staples.  \n\nI went with a party of seven and the service was fantastic.  Our server was timely, attentive and helpful (granted, the place wasn't exactly packed).  The service was the best part of the night.\n\nThe food, however, was merely underwhelming.  The steaks were cooked appropriately, but lacked any real beef flavor and the all-important char.  Sure, I'm not paying $50+ for a bone-in rib eye (like at Prime or Carnevino), but in order to compete in this economy and market, it should still taste as good.  The sides were good, but not very memorable.\n\nTerzetto is a value, in that prices are below what you'd find at the better steakhouses.  Unfortunately, you get what you pay for and this place is underwhelming."
0,"Not really impressed with the actual Hotel part of Hooters. I stayed here one night under a comp from work, probably wouldn't go back on my own dime though to stay here. \n\nThe front desk staff was pretty nice and quick about getting us our rooms, but once i got up the room i was not impressed at all. The room is outdated (expected it from pictures online). I do like that, for the most part, it was clean. I found the bed to be decent at best, definitely not anything to rave about, but it wasn't disgusting by any means\n\nDownstairs in the casino area is pretty fun though. They still had the $1.50 Bud Light special i heard some friends talking about when i got there so i had a couple of those and then some fries to snack on downstairs. Not the best place to grab food i must say, but you can't beat $1.50 beer! The bar tenders are always nice too, very quick and efficient and they don't screw up anything. Always checking up to make sure my group didn't need anything as well. \n\nLooked like lots of people were enjoying the pool, which did look pretty cool, especially at night. It wasn't a bunch of rowdy drunks either, most of the people seemed to just be relaxing and having a good time poolside with some drinks. \n\nThe location of the hotel isn't that great. It's just slightly off the strip, the MGM is right across if you want to take the monorail, but you'll probably need a Taxi to go to any of the bigger hotels. But then again, that's why this hotel is by no means pricey. \n\nAll in all, i think the Hooters hotel is a better place to hang out, gamble and have drinks than it is to stay. If you want a budget room than this hotel isn't bad, you'll get a decent room at a really good price. But this is definitely more of a party and bar place then it is a hotel to me."
0,"This is a restaurant with great beers on tap plus bar and frequent promo nights. Definitely go when there is one - the reps are great to talk to and swag is often generous. It's far for me, I don't go often, but I'm giving this a somewhat mixed review with a downward turn.\nBeer selection is decent, but I hate the chalice glasses for the higher alcohol beers. Just give me a snifter. I guess they break too often, too many rookies,so they go with the dollar store chalice for durability. Yes I've seen them at Dollar Tree.\nI'm mainly addressing the food.\nI ordered the fish n chips. I knew it wasn't gonna be British style, but I still have my complaints - the fish was 3 small pieces rather than 2 large ones, and the batter was RUBBERY!! I could literally stretch the fish pieces apart. I hated that! So annoying! I think my fish was pre-cooked and then microwaved, that's why the batter was rubbery. GRRRRRRR!!! I STRONGLY SUSPECT THIS!!! I hope whoever reads this who works there, that they feel royally BUSTED! You make me ANGRY AS F*&%!!! Learn how to do crispy fish the British way!\nAlso not much fish volume. Again, I was expecting two decently sized fish pieces. The fries were good, no complaints there. I sampled my friend's sweet potato fries from his pork sandwich, they were good too, good texture. \nI glanced at my friend's BBQ pork sandwich, it had bacon on it, and came with BBQ sauce on the side. I tasted the sauce. Spicy and delicious! ZING! My friend pulled off some bacon from the sandwich. Not like him to do that, he's a bacon FREAK like I am. I look closer. The bacon wasn't cooked all the way, it was rubbery and fatty. COME ON!!\nMy other friend ordered a gyro and fries. The meat was barely represented. CHINSE!\nOne amazing thing I will note however, was that even though the place was full (not packed), the food came out LIGHTNING FAST. Maybe too fast, not enough time to cook the bacon all the way or do decent fish.\nThe good service keeps you from getting ONE star.\n\nI should've eaten at Angels Trumpet instead."
0,"DONT EVER GET RX HERE!!!\n\nMy doctor sent in a prescription for my daughter, and it was a sedative because she was undergoing a procedure. I picked up the prescription, and noticed immediately that the amount of dosage was very high for a small child. \n\nI talked to the actual pharmacist and he said that the amount of dose could put my daughter to sleep - forever. He had us take the prescription anyway. \n\nI immediately called my pediatrician on the way to the hospital, who had to inform the nurse of the CORRECT dose to give. Never again."
0,Never again!!! I called they said waiting time 45minutes I said okay I called again and they said they already sent someone guess what??! 2hrs nobody came I called to cancel and he said oh we just sent someone? Really so why the hell was i waiting for so long if u didn't send anybody? I'm never gonna use their services again... And the customer service is even worst... They don't deserve any stars.
1,"I have a flat garage roof, which has been troublesome for years. In 2010, I had Trades Unlimited repair it. They tore out the old roof, down to the plywood, and rebuilt it. Then they foamed it. That was three years ago, and I've had no trouble with that roof since. \n\nFlat roofs are really a problem, in my experience. Trades Unlimited did a great job for me. I recommend them."
1,"Ok, so by now - anyone who's read several of my reviews knows i can't figure out the 1/2 star click, hence many ratings are leaning toward 4 stars!   \n\nThis place would really go 3 1/2 stars but I like it just cuz I LIKE it - so I bumped them up to 4 stars!! \n\nI stopped in there on Sunday (I eat out WAY too much!!).  \nI didn't realize it when I got in there ... and it wasn't until the bill came that, much to my surprise, it was 1/2 off day!!  1/2 off the ENTIRE food menu!!   NIIIIIICE!!   Looks like Sundays are 1/2 off days.....\n\nMy 'weight watching' was out the window and on my table was a great skillet of the garlic / fetta fries!  ohhh they are sooo good! Tangy and saucy but the fries are golden and crisp on the outside, soft on the inside!!\n\nI had the Mediterranean wrap ... it's very good!! I couldn't finish it all - it's a good size wrap (and note the garlic cheese fries mentioned above? yah, i think i ate most of them!!) \nRegardless, the wrap was fully loaded, a good amount of chicken and sauce inside, but not crazy amounts. \n\nMy date had a burger, which upon the first two bites, he said 'wow! this is a really good burger!'  So i take that as his complete and full review!!  The bun looked like a real 'bakery' type roll - which even if it wasn't, it looked and tasted that way!  The burger itself was cooked nicely and very juicy - good qualities in a burger! \n\nSo  - one side of the garlic/cheese fries, a wrap, a burger and an ice tea and water  ....total was $11 (and change) ....that's a freakin GREAT DEAL!   Good food, half the price!\n\nIt really wasn't busy and i've been in there another time and it was the same - not busy. \n\nOn the somewhat odd side, both times it had a very 'clean' smell to the place.  Although I do appreciate they take their cleanliness seriously, maybe backdown on the pine sol just a tad!  \n\nGo check 'em out ... good stuff!!"
0,"Lunch special only  till 4 pm . $7.99. Okay food nothing special that would make me want to come back. Service was just OK. Overall, I have had way better thai food else where ."
0,"Decent food. We were greeted by a very nice hostess, but our waitress seemed bothered to by our presence. We were seated next to patrons who gushed over how good the food was. When our waitress came we had some questions and she was very curt. She never asked if wanted anything to drink and we ordered wings as an appetizer and she put the wings on the plate with our entree. We would probably come back for the food but wanted this establishment to know that service is part of the eating experience."
1,"All chicken dinners should start out with a side of waffle, don't you think?\n\nA group of us went to Lo Lo's on Saturday night before the opening of Arizona Theatre Company's AIN'T MISBEHAVIN'. We figured dining on soul food would be a great precursor to the amazing music of \""Fats\"" Waller. \n\nThe service was super-quick (although, it WAS quite early. We were there at 5:30 PM). Our friends who are regulars recommended spouses sharing the Soul Food Platter. I thought that was a good idea, but my husband said, \""Next time, I'm getting my own!\"" \n\nWe started off with a waffle - yum - and then got our fried chicken (which I never, ever have, so that was a real treat), grits, cornbread, and mac & cheese. \n\nOK, this is bad ... I'm getting hungry thinking about our food from last night. I think that's a sign that we will need to return sometime soon. \n\nA note about credit cards: They informed us that they would not accept more than 2 transactions per party, which was good to know. Luckily, most people had cash, so we only had to have them run one card. Just be aware, as people are so used to handing over multiple credit/debit cards these days."
1,"Delicious!  Went here before a nearby show and the only problem I had with it was how much garlic hummus I ate beforehand... but that's not their problem.  I wasn't exactly adventurous in my burger choice,  I got the American burger with bacon added but it was absolutely delicious.  My party also got the kisra and hummus which as a garlic lover I couldn't get enough of.  I took a bite of my friends Fez burger (they offered!) and I really enjoyed it even though I didn't think I would.  The high reviews for this place are completely justified."
1,"we tried the carrot cake cupcake and the cosmo cupcake.  The cupcakes are denser than you would expect, more like a muffin.  The frosting was wonderful.  Worth a stop."
0,"If I could give zero stars, I would. This company is so unprofessional! I scheduled a three hour cleaning, left work early to be home when the cleaners arrived, and no one ever showed up. No phone call, nothing. In fact, it took an hour to reach someone at the office (during business hours). The man I spoke with told me he'd find out what happened and call right back. But did he call? No. I finally called back an hour after that, and after a few tries, he finally answered and said the cleaners' car had broken down and that they would come the next day instead. However, he had forgotten to ask them what time they'd be there and so promised he'd call me right back with the time. I didn't hear from him. I called the following day and a woman answered the phone. I explained what happened, she apologized, and promised to have someone come that day. She said she'd call in ten minutes to let me know when they would arrive. That was three days ago. I still haven't heard back. \n\nIn short, don't waste your time or your money."
0,I have always liked Filibertos. When this one opened I was pretty excited. Sadly it has gone downhill. The machaca burrito is now a little bit of machaca and more onion and green pepper. Also Bertos was known for its complimentary salsa bar including carrots and jalapenos. Now the carrots are extra and they are horrible. Go across the street  for better food. Also the girl at the counter was about a surly as could be.
1,"Best Vietnamese in town! I used to live in Laos, and visited Vietnam a number of times. This place is a great memory lane for me. Really quick service, cozy feeling dining hall. I have never done the buffet, I always order strictly Viet food from the menu and have never been let down."
0,I have been to this location a handful of times but idk if I will be coming back mainly because of the oscars...so this is what happened:\n\nMy bf and I ask our waiter if he can turn one of the tv to abc so we can watch the Oscars while we eat. The waiter goes n the back and says yes they will change it. So we get our appetizer of oxtail fries and the channel still hasn't changed. \n\nWe basically finish the platter and still haven't seen our waiter 2 remind him about the channel so we flag down another waiter. This waiter says something like we don't change the channel and y would u want 2 watch it with out volume but I will see what we can do.\n\nBy this time our burgers come out. I am semi enjoying my Kiki burger when our first waiter approaches. He remembers that he was going 2 change the channel and ask us y the channel hasn't changed. OMG @ this point we just ask for our check and leave.\n\nIdk what the big deal was it was 530 on a Sunday with 3 other people in the restaurant and they were not even facing the tv.\n\nI doubt we will return.
1,"Terrific. The pizza is close enough to when I lived in Philly, and the flavored crust is great. The chicken is great, I tried the hot."
1,"Bill's is a great place to come and crash if you're shell-shocked by the prices on the Strip.  I walked in with three other friends after we ran from Caesar's high table minimums and beer prices.  $8 for two pitchers of beer?  $1 margaritas?  $5 table minimums?  Lounge singers?  Old people dancing?  I'm sold, baby.\n\nIn terms of decor, quality of the bands, friendliness of the dealers, etc.. you'll definitely get exactly what you pay for.  But at least you aren't paying a lot."
0,"I have to add my own one star review for Honda West.  If I could give negative stars I would.  I'll just describe their dishonesty and won't mention their aggressive and surly behavior they demonstrated when I was ripped off by them.  \n\nSkip this place and take your car somewhere else.  They sneakily charge for estimates.  Shouldn't it be free for someone to tell you how much they will charge to fix a simple problem?  Yes is the answer.  I brought my car in for a simple fix not motor related.  They told me to sign the paper and they would get back to me.  They told the repair would be in excess of $400.00.  My car is barely worth that much.  Before I can get my car back, they tell me it will be $100.00 to get my keys.  That is their estimate fee that  I signed for.  \n\nI would have never thought of them charging me for that.  Shame on me for signing their dishonest papers without looking, but who would have thought I would be charged for an estimate.  And shame on them for not telling me they charge for an estimate.  \n\nNEVER GO HERE!"
0,"SCAM ALERT!! I wish I could put zero stars. My wife was told at her free consultation that she was an ideal candidate for laser hair removal, so she signed up for the full Brazilian treatment. Originally it was supposed to cost over $200. We got it down to $100 a month, but over three years. Six months into her contract she was told that she has a lot of blonde hairs that they wouldn't be able to do anything about. So basically our $3600 is being put towards nothing. When she talked to Ideal Image about it, they just said \""A contract is a contract.\"" Unbelievable. They have been reported to the Better Business Bureau and hopefully will clean up their act soon or shut their doors forever. Either one. Ideal Ripoff."
0,"I would like to give it more stars but I was simply aggravated by the service here that I really don't see myself going back! My sister and I went in a couple of Saturdays ago for lunch and we were seated away from the door they had maybe 6 tables in there so not crazy. We were approached by a server and she got us water, then another server came over to ask if we've heard the specials, then another server came over to see if we had any questions, and then finally another server came over to see if we were ready, all in the meantime i never got my iced tea i ordered but the table next to me did and they ordered it after me. Then i asked for sweetener and that finally came after i asked again for it. WHO IS MY SERVER!!! \n\nI was sooo annoyed at this point so we go to order a few of things that everyone has been yelping about- Squash Blossoms and the Bruscetta the server says oh were out of the squash blossoms-um hi we've had 10 servers and not one of you could tell us the things you were out of....then i order my gnocchi-were out of that too, no apology but yet the server staring at me like what else do you want. \n\nWe started off with the Artichoke- lacked so much flavor but we couldn't figure out how because the garlic sauce it was sitting in was good. Then we had the Asparagus Bruscetta- very good and so nice and fresh. We both ended up with the Vegetable Pannini it was ok lacked flavor again and too much bread. So we finish our lunch and i notice the manager fighting with the servers to start cleaning up the dining room and getting it reset- I honestly could not believe this women was serious like take it to the kitchen not in the middle of your dining room!! so unprofessional so its almost like you cant blame the servers because they are being lead by this woman!! \n\nOne last thing- this is not the Penguin/Diamond you really cant do the tag team service in a place like this because of your prices and at least at the Diamond they're good servers and aren't so intrusive!! I live in the neighborhood and I cant say that I want to return or recommend anyone to try it. Good concept could be better once you work out the front of the house situation and you will be ten times better!!"
1,"I love this place but the line is always so long no matter when I go! AHHH! But, it does move pretty quickly. Some of the staff is great, others not so much, but I don't really care... I just go for the gelato! :)\n\nHaven't tried the Gelattes yet but I'm sure they are amazing.\n\n**Espresso Chip/Dark Chocolate is my favorite flavor combination."
1,Located in the food court at the Boulevard mall. I love this place! The have the most amazing terriyaki bowls. The bowls cost $5.89 and are plenty to fill even those with a pretty big appetite. I haven't really tasted any of the combos but they are priced between $6-$7. The only thing I don't like about it is the location. Must eat when at the mall! We even drive there once in a blue moon just for the food.
1,"We went to the Green Mango for the first time last week and it was excellent. The curry was exceptionally tasty (and spicy!) and the food was  fresh and delicious. We got quick service and plenty of rice, which is key when the curry is so rich. And It was still warm enough to sit outside on the sidewalk where we could watch the Regents Square crowd go by, which is fun.  Highly recommended - it's our new favorite thai spot in town."
1,"What to say about this place? Great food, great service and the location is great if you like to hike North Mountain a lot :-)\n\nI'm no expert with Tortas but this place has some amazing ones which will fill you up with lunch and dinner! Being a long time fan of Travel Channel's \""Man vs Food\"" I've been meaning to try this place for some time now. Glad I did. Sure you will too."
0,"Horrible security! Just went here last weekend on a Saturday night for the Snoopadelic  theme party and it was horrible! Our friend spent A LOT of money for a VIP booth (2 bottles of Dom perignon,  two bottles of grey goose and Crown, all the fixings and mixtures) and we had to leave early because of the craziness of the crowd and lack of security. We were in a bottom booth with one rope to try to reserve our section but after the club was packed it was impossible to keep strangers out of the booth. There was seriously pushing and shoving, drinks thrown when asked for people to get out of the section and we were forced to do all of this ourselves because there was no security in sight! It got to the point where I was actually scared thinking we could get trampled on! The staff was unprofessional, and did not acknowledge our initial concern of our safety when the rope continued to be pulled away due to  the crowd trying to walk through.  They allow way too many people in the club, there is no room to even dance anywhere, and the total ambiance that night was just negative to me. The girl  swimming in the huge glass was cool, but that was about it. I feel bad for anyone not in a VIP booth because I don't even know how you would get a drink. Never returning, very disappointed...and that's hard to do in Vegas."
1,"I go to Murray Avenue Kosher quite often to pick up fish, bread and on occasion the prepared deli foods which are usually high quality.  The service especially at the checkout counter is not customer friendly but not intentionally rude.  I really like the kosher wine section as well as the large selection of smoked fish and kosher cheeses. Be prepared to pay higher prices than at the general supermarkets ( kosher is generally more costly everywhere).  While the service may not be over friendly (although I have never really had a problem) I have always found the other customers to be both polite and often friendly."
1,"3.5 rounded up. \n\nI can say I have been going to Fuji Buffet since they opened. I am a frequent customer that is becoming a little less frequent. \n\nThis place used to be amazing and I'm afraid that its losing it freshness. My last 2 visits have only been OK at best. The place is always clean and service is good. What has been lacking is the buffet itself. Only about half the dishes are fresh the last couple visits and when asked to bring out fresh on some older dishes that need to be switched up ...they never seem to show up. Unless they did after I had left. \n\nOn a side note: The food that is Fresh is Very good, flavorful. I enjoy the crab puffs and alot of the chicken and seafood dishes. Also the Crab legs. \n\nI'm guessing this is why the customer base is slowly getting smaller. In the past when I went here the place was always packed. Now not so much. I hope the owner or Manager takes care of the issues. Would still like to have a good buffet close to the house."
1,I found This Old Vape Shop on the recommendation of a FB friend. I was instantly drawn in with the friendly people and the enormous juice selection. They had a juice I'd been looking for and many others I was introduced to. You guys rock. Definitely be returning and hanging out again. Thanks guys.
1,"Love, love....love this place!\n\nEVERYTIME and I mean every time, I am happy I came.\n\nThey make my sushi order quickly even though the place is usually busy.\n\nI have brought friends that have ordered from the full menu and they, too, like the food. \n\nBroccoli is always done right: green and slightly crispy...I love it!"
1,"I am not usually a fan of buffets but before heading to Las Vegas I took some time\nto read about several places that were of note, especially within my hotel.\nWicked Spoon was apparently one of them.\n\n\nNot your traditional buffet, the portions were individual and of fantastic quality. No spooning your eggs out of a mass vat here or harsh heat lamps. For example; look at the above mini eggs benny!?\n\n Each table was given a large glass bottle of Aquahealth water and of course unlimited coffee, juices etc and if you paid a bit extra, unlimited mimosas, bloody mary's or champs!\n\nI am a sucker for miniature versions of things..the takeout boxes they put the asian cuisine in were no exception. Also offered: korean bbq, miniature fried chicken drumsticks that come in your own little fryer basket, prosciutto pizza, duck confit ravioli with sage (sweet and savory perfection) beet and arugula salad and so much more.\n\nI loved that even though it was morning there were excellent lunch options\nwhich I sampled without holding back (it was for research!)\n\nOther dishes of note: the chicken apple sausage was heavenly, mini croissants, hash, fruit/cheese bar, sausage station in general, asian fusion area and a carving station.\n\nI had read that Wicked Spoon previously did not have labels on everything to\nencourage conversation about the food. That has since changed which made\nthings pretty convenient.\n\nThe service was impeccable - I would return indefinitely and recommend\nit highly if and when you return to Vegas next!"
0,"I'm waiting for return calls on an issue with their survey, that (AMC) asked me to do. They want your $$$$, but don't want your opinion!"
0,"It's a shame, but after each visit, I've become less and less impressed. My first visit was phenomenal and my second visit was still pretty great (as evidenced in my previous review). The Wood-Fired Beef was a bit dry during my third visit, but I brushed it aside attributing it to a fluke or bad timing. However, my last visit has solidified my disappointment and necessity to write an updated review.\n\nSince I've had five of their arepa options, I decided it was time for another one, so I chose the Vegetarian (avocado, black beans, tomato, peppers, onion) for $5. I was confused at first because all I saw were black beans with a little bit of avocado barely surfacing (reference photo). Maybe they got my order wrong? I searched for vegetables through the beans with no success. It wasn't until I took a few bites that I finally located a very sad tomato piece. I figured that was just how they made the \""Vegetarian\"" arepa. The beans were nicely seasoned, but their overwhelming quantity made it incredibly difficult to eat in an arepa. The arepa itself was delicious, as always. I was already disappointed by my selection because of the lack of vegetables, then I saw photos of what the Vegetarian Arepa should look like or have looked like and now I'm upset. It costs the same as or more than their meat options and they can't include a heap of vegetables? Not cool!\n\nAlso, after four visits, it doesn't seem like a coincidence that my table is consistently ignored. No one ever checks on us (it's usually me and Ruben), while they seem more than happy to visit and chat with several other customers. It has made us feel unwelcome. I'm really sad to say this, but I will be getting my arepas elsewhere from now on."
0,"This place is great for last minute things when going out for a weekend adventure but it's not the size of the store or the selection they offer that bothers me about this location...it's the lack of customer service. I've been into this store multiple times and have never been acknowledged. No \""hello\"" or \""can I help you find something?\"" I've been in, looked for what I wanted, waited for assistance, and have walked out every time without making a purchase or speaking to an employee. That's not good customer service....anywhere."
0,WTF this place has really gone downhill.\n\nI ate here twice last week and neither time was impressive. \n\nMeal one: My turkey burger was so dry and yucky that I only ate the avocado off the top. The burger was like hockey puck. The bun was a little stale. The fries were okay. The waitress did not notice my disdain. \n\nMeal two: Seriously the worst grilled cheese Panini I ever had. The sweet potato fries were okay but didn't hold a candle to Fez fries. \n\nI do like purse hooks at the bar. \n\nI remember a time when Delux served delicious food that was well prepared and um..actually tasted good. Now two sucky sandwiches later I long for the yesteryear of Delux.\n\nEven the a la care fries lost their charm.\n\nStep it up Delux you are losing me!
0,"Beware!  I bought a pet from them and was not told that I was being charged 96% interest.  I didn't even know that was legal.  I even called the company doing the financing Duvera and they were misleading when I asked about the interest in the beginning.  They said it would be $150 in interest, but that was really just the first month of interest!  Petland definitely did not tell me it would be 96% interest or I would have never signed up!  And when I called to complain the manager just told me that I was told.  There is no way I would have signed up for something at 96% interest ever.  Make sure you read everything before you buy your pet here if you are doing financing. I'm an astute person and very careful about my money.  I feel duped and taken advantage of by both Petland and Duvera and there's no recourse whatsoever.  I'm just out $1,200. \n\nIf I had to do this over again I would definitely go through a breeder.  My dog was very difficult to potty train because of the crate situation in pet stores.  They assured me at Petland that the dog didn't come from a puppy mill and that I could look up her parents on the internet, which I did when I came home.  And she did come from a puppy mill.  I googled Top Notch Breeders and it turns out they are a puppy mill.\n\nI love my dog, and I'm glad I have her, but be very careful if you choose to deal with this company.  There's nothing I can do now but hopefully help someone else."
0,"Got served WARM wine and asked for a chilled glass and was defined as \""high maintenance.\"" (My friend told me after we walked away) When I order a nice glass of wine, especially for the prices in these Scottsdale establishments, I expect it to be served at the proper temperature. The wine was boiling hot and when we asked for a chilled glass or a cooler bottle, we got attitude. The manager did come over and apologize - offered a round which we declined. We saw him talking with the bar-staff a few minutes later. We go to this place often because Chris Parker's band plays here, but not for long if we encounter this again."
0,"am i the only one who thinks pottery barn has gone down hill? pottery barn has never been my style to begin with, every now and then i find things i like but there's something country about it and i don't like country. \n\nanyway. \n\nthe quality is not what it used to be. and the service is farrrr from good. \n\njust today i was accused of being dishonest because i wanted to return some crappy plates that were falling apart. \n\n\""are you sure it's not just normal wear and tear? we have a lot of people trying to return stuff so they can have brand new dishes before the holidays.\""\n\n\""um, that most certainly is not me and im offended you would insinuate i'm trying to do that\""\n\n\""im not insinuating anything ma'am.\"" \n\n\""really? then why say it?\""\n\ni expect this sorta crap from target but im totally shocked pottery barn is hopping on the crappy customer service wagon. \n\nlet me get this straight:\nyou sell me borderline expensive crap, i complain about the crap and want to return it, instead of standing behind your product and taking care of your customer, you suggest that a lot of people are dishonest when they return stuff but i shouldn't take offense? \n\nthe problem is not me, its you and your crappy dishes.\n\n i won't be returning."
0,"I've stayed here for two weeks so I figured out the place pretty well.\nPros: Customer service was good. Airport shuttles also take you to nearby locations within 4 miles of the hotel for free. The employees are friendly. The pool is great. The water is on the warm side.\nCons: The key cards here are INCREDIBLY BAD QUALITY. I had to get a new one almost every single day (for fourteen days, yes). They get demagnitized very easily and the door locks ALL seem to be barely in working order. I would have to always put my card in 3-5 times before they would work. One of the only two elevators doesn't have the floor number signal working and they both make weird noises. I got over my fear of slow strange sounding elevators quick. I guess I can thank them for that. WIFI IS EXPENSIVE. Hotels this bad really should have wifi to try to lure customers in that way. Why would someone pay so much for wifi if they had budget constraints leading them to settle to this hotel?\n\nNot worth it. Look elsewhere."
0,"Gave bar louie  a tried this past veteran day weekend because the que  for the surrounding  restaurants were long.  Worst mistake ever! It was self seating so we scanned for a table that were most visible.  Waited there for 20 min while the staffs walked pass our tables a dozen times.  We managed to make eye contact with a few of them,  however they acted as if we were wearing the cloak of invisibility.  We ended up walking out at the end without trying their food.  I'm surprise that place is still open."
1,"Their technicianwas atmy housewithin 45 minutes ofmy callin SanTan Valley.  Jeremy was friendly,  quick and efficient.  He knew the problem in minutes and the repairs were completed quickly. I had a cold house Weirton 1.5 hours from my call for repairs.  I got five star service, but gave them for stats because it was a bit pricey,  but for me it was worth it to not have to wait and have friendly service."
0,"We went to Autofit in Tempe to buy a NEW bumper.  The company stated they could indeed find a new bumper for our car but that it would need to be painted to match my vehicle.  Additionally, they kept my original bumper to use parts from that were intact and not needed to be repurchased.  After they finished installing the \""new\"" bumper we drove away and noticed it seemed to be acting strange.  Upon investigation we noticed they had actually put back on my original bumper and glued to to make it work and fit back to the car.  We promptly returned to show them and demand our money back.  they quickly started to back track, even stating that they usually use used part (although they priced us and sold us a NEW bumper) and that they couldn't find one.  This business is a scam and they are trying to abuse the consumer.  We received our money back but have wasted 4 days of our time and still do not have our bumper.  If we had not noticed they would have scammed us.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY."
0,"This place is awful! I ordered a table and chairs, when I purchased them they told me 2-3 weeks, but most likely 2. They said they would call on Monday for a more accurate date. I had to call them, they said early next week. I called early the following week and got the same story, them again another time. Finally I went in with my husband and got to talk to the manager. He actually did call me and promised a discount when it was delivered (this is the only reason I have it one star, as if you could give it less).  Then I had to call them to set up a delivery time, they never called. When they delivered my furniture, they didn't have the money refund, I was told I had to go back into the store to get it. I got some attitude, and very disrespectful comments. But at least I got the money. 5 weeks in my new house with a 2 year old and no kitchen table. I'm just glad I don't have to work with that guy ever again!"
0,"I do not understand the rating this place gets. Although you get your food quickly, everything was cold within minutes. The asada is decent, but nothing great. Being from SoCal, this place has nothing on King Taco. The tortillas are fresh, so that is the reason for the 2 stars. I will not pay this place another visit. Maybe I got a bad batch of tacos. The guy that took my order also forgot two of the tacos, but after taking one bite, I was actually glad he did."
1,"It has been a good year or two since I have eaten here last and I'm not sure why. Today reinforced how much I like this place. To me, Qdoba falls into the Chipotle category although I feel the portions are definitely more generous than Chipotle. I like to get the Naked Chicken Burrito which is essentially a burrito with no tortilla. So, basically the Chipotle burrito bowl. It is just under $6 and enough for two meals. I'll instantly halve it when I get home to prevent me from overeating. It is very good. Their guacamole is very good, too. They also have a pick 2 combo for $6 and gives you smaller portions of your choice of the naked burrito, mexican soup, tacos, cheese quesadilla, etc. The other thing I like about this place is the rewards program and also how nice the employees always are. Like I said, it has been a long time since I have been back and I always comment on how friendly the employees are. Good sign."
1,"Best adobada tacos I've had in Vegas.The workers are friendly,the place is clean & open late.Their radishes are huge by the way lol"
0,The customer service here is good but I was not impressed with my miso salmon with brown rice. The presentation was ugly and tasted ugly too. I had plenty of leftovers and left unfulfilled. The chicken broth soup it came with was at least good. I didn't see anything on the menu that stood out so I won't be returnig here ever.
0,"I always wanted to kick back at a bar made of ice. It didn't feel like a winter wonderland at all though. Met a lot of super nice people and had great conversation but also drank some very average cocktails and left feeling cheated. It would have been awesome if we could freely use our phones and if there was something to do inside in addition to ordering a drink, standing, dancing, and sitting down. People weren't really in a dancing mood. I won't come back."

0,"Carl's senior may have been on to something, but Carl's Jr. has messed up the family tradition. If anyone asks you if you'd like to go for a Hot Carl's, they probably don't mean this place, but either way, the answer is NO. Remember that.\n\nThis place is basically just Hardee's, but on the West Coast. It's not the worst fast food place ever, but it's an evil chain (like all other corporate chains) and so I don't suggest trying it. I came to this location in Phoenix, back in 2011 and it was just like all the others. It wasn't my idea to come.\n\nI should mention, I only rate national and global chains on a scale of 1-2. I rate family businesses on a scale of 3-5. Here is why:\n\nWould you rather support the local family, or the multi national corporations and the rich men on yachts in the Carribbean? Why are the parking lots of the awesome local places usually half empty (or completely empty)? Why are the fast food chains always so busy? Why can they afford to open so late and get all the TV advertising and all the prime intersection locations? Why are they taking over all the airports, stations, and rest stops? Why go and support McDonalds, Taco Bell, Burger King, KFC, Wendys, Cold Stone, Subway, and so on? These places have systematically and coldly taken over the national food scene by using the cheapest ingredients, pre-packaged frozen systematic meals that are identical across the nation, ridiculously cheap prices for the polystyrene food on dollar menus, overpricing for everything else, rude underpaid servers on way less than minimum wage, and a ridiculously expensive mass brand advertising campaign that gets inside the heads of all the kids and the 20somethings and keeps them under the illusion that if it's not a brand name, it's not worth visiting. They spend all the money they should be investing in food and service, in advertising and cornering the market - the local places can't compete - and someday all we will be left with is the same chains serving the same food all over the world. That is our future. It's the way we're heading and you know it. Every time you eat at a bland national chain, you buy into that, you support that. Boycott chains. Support your local eateries. It's an embarrassment that generic brand national chains are even listed on a proper foodie website like Yelp, let alone getting 4 and 5 stars from so called foodies. Wake up, America, before we're all just batteries in the matrix."
1,"Sometimes referred to as C4, this is an excellent place to come hang out day or night.  I happen to be enjoying the comfortable oversized leather couch as I type at this very moment.  I'm on the coffee house side but the wine bar is a nice contrast - My BF and I spent one of our fist dates on that side and after a few glasses and a nice buzz, we found ourselves out front making out!\n\nFree Wi-FI can be hard to find, so props to C4 for that alone... cool music, artwork, and a warm cozy atmosphere all add to my loving it here!  I have yet to experience the live entertainment, but the outdoor area is a really cool venue and I will be back!  \n\nIt's worth the commute up north to get out of strip mall hell and experience C4.  Thank you, C4, for free Wi-Fi and a great cup of coffee on this Sunday afternoon - I'll be back soon for sure!"
1,Good company. Fair prices and quality work. Enough said!
1,"Clean, affordable, and friendly. What else can you ask for? After being driven out of my boyfriend's apartment by bed bugs, we needed a place to stay for the night. Although there were less expensive places to grab a room for the night, I always come to Hawthorn. The front desk is respectful and friendly (take notes, Extended Stay on University!), the beds are comfortable, and the AC is cold!! Consistency of service is rare these days, but you can find it here."
0,"I'm glad I'm not the only one that has observed sub-standard flair from this location, management is piss poor and doesn't get it, now they won't get my business. \n\nI ate there in December with family and the experience was that of a very \""OFF\"" operation, nobody to sit you, the front was totally bare, 2 members of the wait staff walked around and served their customers while my party and several others just waited around, a manager that was no where to be found who should have been observing what was going on but was in the back room probably surfing the internet. \n\nFood was overcooked, 3 orders of Eggs Benedict may have well been hard boiled and the sauce had turned, the one order they got right or got it close to being right was the simplest, eggs scrambled with cheese, whomever came up with the idea that you cook it, drop it on a plate and sprinkle the cheese over it and hope that it melts needs to have their cooking spoons taken away but it was tolerable. \n\nMade a few comments to the manager at that time, she was apologetic, I gave them another chance, they blew it again, Sunday morning, busier restaurant, staff met us at the door, sat us and we waited, and waited and waited, watching the waiter from our section walking around the parking lot was a lot of fun while we waited. Finally a waitress came over and got our drink order, could have shown up with water then taken our drink order but it didn't go that way, a few minutes later and we're still waiting, finally some coffee, water, other drinks and she walks away, HEY WE'RE READY TO ORDER, I know she hears it, I'm boisterous at that point, no difference, we wait some more. \n\nFast forward to the food, everything cooked wrong or entire orders are wrong or in one case it has to go back and before finally throwing in the towel and telling the waitress cancel the re-order, everyone is done but one person who didn't end up eating because for some reason it takes longer to cook a medium rare steak than the well done one they delivered or maybe the eggs were still being scrambled. \n\nI called the manager over, advised her of everything that transpired, pointed out her employee was back in the parking lot walking around, talking on the phone and smoking to which her response was oh he's on break, 3 times in the last 30 minutes... wow I wanna work here you don't have to do anything! \n\nFood = Crap\nService = Crap \n\nThis is not indicative of the chain but this location = CRAP !!! \n\nHope they manage to turn it around or there will be another closed food location in Litchfield Park!"
1,"I used to be an In-N-Out fan but Five Guys is now my new favorite new fast food burger joint.  I think Five Guys gives you a good value for its price. The food is fresh and you can choose from a variety of toppings (from mushrooms to peppers) to add on your burger. Also, their fries are pretty good, though they are not as unique as In-N-Out's or McDonald's; I recommend ordering the seasoned ones.\n\nBe sure to tell them you want a \""little\"" hamburger or cheeseburger or they will give you a double patty burger."
1,"Beautiful inside, Friendlu service very very clean fresh fresh food. awesome a must go again."
0,"Yuck! I don't know how this buffet got any good ratings.Food was bland,dry,and over cooked.The worst prime rib in Vegas I have tried so far.The service was great and the price was reasonable,but honestly I would have been happier eating at  the micro brewery next door.The food looked good there.And we got there as soon as it opened for dinner,so there was no excuse for not having fresh food"
1,I've had sushi from all over and Blue Wasabi is my favorite spot. Wish I had one close to where I live now. Any of the rolls are great and service is always top notch. \n\nSmall recommendation - sit outside. The lighting is a bit dark inside.
0,"I heartily agree with Whitney H.  Stubhub is a ripoff.  I paid $150 for a $32 Trans-Siberian Orchestra ticket.  This is \""reasonable,\"" Anthony Z.?  Stubhub promotes usury.  I will never use them again.  Also beware of Steve Jana, the seller."
0,I wouldn't recommend this place - it is WAY overpriced for what it provides. The food is decent but not excellent but everything is about twice the standard price.
1,Nice Staff...Nice Tatt. Thanks guys for making my last one a good one.
1,"This is one of our fav spots!  So much goodness on the menu, our mouth orgazms come from: brown wheat bread, tex mex rolls, and chargrilled coulotte steak.  Perfect size to split between 2 peeps!  Ambiance is always nice and elegant, and service is consistent. \n\nI would offer 2 improvements: 1) don't like my silverware set on the table. 2) ability to make reservation."
1,"Visited for dinner and while it was not very busy on a Saturday evening.  We ordered a Pizza and a Strumboli and gosh we were pleasantly surprised.  \n\nThe personal pizza was wonderfully presented, excellent thin crust that was well done and with topping that were both fresh and bursting with flavor.  The size of the pizza was more in ines of a Personal Plizza Plus :).  \n\nThe  Strumboii was a piece of art.  Never have I seen such a thin crust hold a plethora of sausage.  Most Strumboli's are quite hollow inside and lack much of a meat, but this was certainly one for the history books.\n\nGotta end on a sweet note and tis been ages since I have tasted a cannoli that is so fresh and so flavorful.\n\nI will surely visit again when I am in the area as it truly a hidden gem."
1,"It was time once again for my friend to come into vegas to visit me.\nAnd like tradition we had dinner at our favorite place.\n\nThis time I decided to try something new, the blackened chicken pasta.\nAn excellent dish that i really loved eating.\nChicken was moist, not dry and blackened just right.\nThe creamy Cajun alfredaux was just perfect.\n\nI also went with my traditional side of asparagus which this time around was cooked to my usual liking.\n(It's so hard to find restaurants that can cook asparagus correctly)\n\nWe also had the same friendly waiter from our last visit.\n\nAnother pleasant experience."
0,Food is mediochre at best. Service is slow even by geologic time. The micro brew is typical and unimaginitive. On the good side the patio is dog friendly. One star just for that.
1,Awesome church full of the spirit of God!
1,"Ok, so I'm not going to say they are better than NYC bagels. Why? Because these Montreal bagels are a different beast than their cousins in the States. These are slightly smaller and thinner. St. Viateur's come in a variety of flavors. At this shop you can come and get them hot out of the oven at all times. I recommend immediately tearing into one while it's still warm and soft. Then you'll realize how heavenly light and fluffy they are. I walked down the street devouring one. This location sells only bagels and has a cooler full of cream cheeses, assorted bagel toppings, and cold beverages. I wish I had a bagel joint like this in L.A. to walk to on a lazy weekend morning. \n\nOh, and they are AS good as NYC bagels. Yum!"
1,Super bomb huge pizza slices. Authentic Italian history lessons accompany each meal. Very good times.
0,"Good prices, but I won't go there again.  I dropped a shirt off that I needed for New Years Eve.  I went in Dec 30 but it wasn't ready.  When I came to pick it up NYE at 4, the place was closed.   No sign, no warning.  They closed at 2.\n\nWhen I talked to the owner after, he said they were trying to tell people about closing early.  HOW ABOUT A SIGN DUMBASS!!     I told him they didn't tell me that and asked for a credit but he just didn't care that I had to spend $27 on a new dress shirt because they decided to close early and not tell anyone.\n\nVERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
0,"The only reason I took the time to write this review is to prevent others from having a similar experience we did. We were craving some good Vietnamese food and after reading all the 4 and 5 star reviews of this restaurant, decided to give it a try. The place itself has a lot to be desired, but not even the dirty floor and a filthy door handle scared us off. After all, the other 30+ people loved the food. So was the food worth the experience? Not at all! I am still trying to figure out what is so special about the spring rolls the reviewers are raving about. This place made Pei Wei seem like top of the line Asian cuisine."
1,First time here. They have the best chicken! it so flavorful and the grits is to die for! We met the owner she is nice. The place is small and they have only 10 tables. Nice and clean place. We have found a new place to go everytime we go to vegas.
1,"We have eaten at Jewel's twice in the past month for lunch and so far, we love it!  After learning of a gluten sensitivity I needed to cut it out of my diet for a while and it is so nice to have a restaurant where I don't have to search the menu for only a few items that I can eat.  The brownies, cinnamon rolls, and vegan cupcakes were delicious as well!  The kids meals for $5 are perfect and my son eats all the grilled cheese and fresh fruit that it comes with.  Great job, we will keep on coming in!"
0,"Good food, crappy service.  Been here before,  but the service tonight was unacceptable.  We ordered a pizza,  fries and waters.  Had to wait long after our glasses were Empy for refils, and after we finished eating,  we waited over 30 minutes for our server to check in and see if everything was okay. At that point we simply wanted to leave and asked for a box and our check,  but we ended up waiting an extra 15 minutes for that.\nthe place was not packed by any means.  The only positive was green olives on the pizza....."
1,"I don't get why so many people here say it's a bad place. Personally I think this is one of the best Chinese sit down restaurant walking distance from U Waterloo. The menu has many choices, taste is decent, and the dishes are fairly priced."
1,Hesitant to come here at first despite all the good reviews. It's just the concept of paying for a meal where the star attraction is the noodles and the dipping sauce it comes in just isn't that appealing. I'm used to a bowl of noodles where the broth is the highlight of the dish or the ingredients are and the noodles just complement as well as add some filling in the bowl.\n\nBeing this was my first time at I-Naba i opted to try the evening's tasting menu which was a 4 course dinner for 18. Portions were small which reflects traditional Japanese style. I didn't remember to take a picture of the tasting menu. With that in mind i'm going to describe what came out without knowing their proper names or the other option available.\n\n1st course - braised mackrel \nServed cold which was a surprise to me but still pretty good. The sauce they braised in it was light and refreshing and paired quite nicely with the mackrel \n\n2nd course - deep fried shrimp with a hunk of fish cake attached to it served with fried tofu and eggplant in sauce\nThe fish cake is very Japanese which is the only way i can describe it. Flavored with herbs and heavy with course cuts of vegetables. not exactly what i was expecting with it comes to fish cake but it was still nice. \n\n3rd course - Bowl of udon soup with slices of rib eye\nEven though this place is known for it's soba noodles the udon is excellent. The broth was light and refreshing as well as complemented the udon noodles quite well.\n\n4th course - shaved watermelon ice with sesame ice cream\nThe sesame ice cream had honey drizzled over it and was a small scoop but packed a very rich and pleasant sesame taste. They did an excellent job shaving the watermelon ice as it wasn't prone to melting quickly and had a rich watermelon taste.\n\nNot exactly what i was expecting at all when i came here but will gladly return.
0,"Well, here I go again in Vegas with Mexican Food. This place was recommended by a friend but it might have been go there and drink and I missed that part. As a bar it was happening but the food was unimpressive. I got fajitas and it was tasteless and totally forgettable. I knew I had to review it fast before I forgot the entire experience lol. It looks like as a bar this place might be cool. Its across from the Hard Rock so it seems to fill up. However, it felt like locals in there so I am not sure who is filling it up. I will have to hit it on the way home some night and check it out as a bar not a restaurant.\n\nOne thing I found annoying as well, as they charge $1 for chips and salsa?? So I thought wow it must be good, uh.. no.. It was nothing to even recall, in fact I cant remember what it tasted like. So no freebies in this joint."
0,"Pierre, you've said everything there is to say about this.  I can't wait to see it bulldozed.  Any day now."
1,"If you live in Tempe you know there is no shortage of bars in our blazing college town. What happens when you graduate from college and walking across that stage to get your diploma also means you grow into a need for local hangouts where everybody still knows your name...just without the fight song sing-alongs and the floor so sticky you can't make it to the bathroom without losing a shoe? \n\nMac's Broiler & Tap is a quiet neighborhood hangout that still has that ever-present Tempe college spirit...for grown ups. Delicious bar food is abundant, beer is flowing from the tap, great daily specials and the service makes you feel right at home. \n\nI stopped by on a Saturday night and found it crowded with enough room to move around and enjoy the place. We easily found two seats at the bar at cozied up for a few drinks and some good conversation. Drinks are reasonably priced and you will nearly always be greeted by a stranger with a friendly hello. \n\nWhat may be it's strongest selling point is Mac's phenomenal location. In what may very well be one of the best corners in Tempe, Mac's is nestled in between one of the state's most amazing independent book sellers, Changing Hands and Trader Joe's grocery store. With so much going for it, make a day out of it!"
1,"I'm weirded out by the bad reviews.\n\nI took my kids for lunch.  The dining room is clean and nicely decorated.  The staff was very attentive.\n\nThe value is amazing.  For just over $5  you pick your entree and it comes with lo mein (looks simple but tastes wonderful), fried rice (ok) or white rice and a chicken egg roll.\n\nMy son had the volcano beef.  He really liked it.  My girls shared the honey chicken.  It looked fabulous and they really enjoyed it.  I had the vegetable deluxe.  Likely the best veggies, tofu and sauce I have ever had.\n\nFor dessert we all shared a huge mango smoothie that was less than $2.  Yum!\n\nI look forward to going back.  So happy to have found a restaurant close to home that I like so much!"
0,"Let me preface this review with a couple of things:\n1. I went on a Monday at 3pm, so probably not the most ideal time to see the freshest foods and most attentive staff, but less people to fight with to get to the food\n2. I live in Manhattan so I am spoiled by knowing what good food and service are\n3. I understand that a buffet, even an expensive buffet will never meet the quality of a decent restaurant\n\nWith all that said, the variety and quality of food was JUST BARELY OK, after seeing several reviews I guess my expectations got a little too high.\n\nAlso of note I found a HAIR in my gravy, when I mentioned it to the waitress her extremely caviler response was some thing to the effect of \""OK, I let them know\"".  No \""I'm so sorry\"" or \""I really apologize\"", NOTHING.\n\nAll in all not a great experience, but if you want a large quantity of food you can't beat it for 20 bucks"
1,"Really good food, it's a bit pricey for the gluten free bruschetta because it comes on little sand dollar sized crostini. I had to order something else to eat. They also had s'mores that you could make at your table which was super cool, but I would have like the option of a better chocolate than Hershey's. I get that they are probably trying to resurrect childhood memories but if you are paying top dollar, might as well class it up a bit. \n\nI LOVE the cucumber water and the decor. And all the food tastes really fresh. My friend got a drink (grapefruit martini) and said it was tasty and strong."
0,"The biggest problem with this buffet is that the food isn't hot or even very warm.  You'd think with tiny portions they could at least serve the food at a decent temperature. My husband and I arrived soon after they opened for dinner yet the food didn't look fresh.\n\nWe were looking forward to a delicious anniversary dinner but left disgusted--bloody cold meat and icky seafood. Our waiter was nice and the coffee was rich and hot, other than that, it was a waste of money."
1,Very good food and fantastic service.  Great place to watch a game with lots of TVs.
1,"It's the Grand Luxe - I love this place.  It's basically like the grimy diner of vegas.  You're not their expecting amazing food.  You go there to get food energy to go back to pounding drinks and gambling like a degenerate.\n\nThe salads are surprisingly good, otherwise you get the fried crap that you eat at TGIF or a diner.  It's not great, but certainly not bad.\n\n++ It's open later than other places."
0,"The pizza was mediocre at best. I ordered a roasted veggie, and I honestly prefer the Kashi frozen pizza over Manolo's version, which was greasy and a bit too crunchy. It was also a bit too pricey considering the quality."
1,"Great old smokey hotel and casino. You never have to wait for a drink, even at nickle poker. The dollar breakfast or whatever the price is these days is good, everything is buttered, just the way I like it. Certainly not a high class joint and I would not want to stay here but for a low key slumming it is a fun place."
1,"They have a trojan horse, a great aquarium, live and anamatronic theater, two wolfgang puck restaurants, an Il Mulino, a chrome hearts, a Thomas Pink, a Nike town........and a friggin Cheescake Factory?  Please.\n\nLove the place, love the shopping, love the escalators......but one off for the Factory."
1,Nice and friendly staff... very clean inside. Folks ... the parking lot is fine.. Went there number of times. Always fresh donuts.... Krispy Kreme are the best. \nGreat location ..
0,"Waiting in line forever at deli, bakery, meat etc, apparently all employee's are cashiering! What about customers not at the checkout lanes Fry's? Bad management."
0,"First time I went to this location and I am never going back.  I ordered two smoothies and one of them wasn't filled all the way compared to the other one (the other one was filled to the brim)!   It was like ordering two sandwiches and receiving one sandwich with half a bun.  I felt like I did not get my money's worth as there was a 2.5-inch waste of volume they could have filled.  Also,  I was careless enough to not check that they correctly stamped enough spots on the stamp card (gives you a free item after the ninth stamp).  They only gave me one stamp even though I ordered three items.  My fault for not correcting them.  However, I felt screwed over from just one visit.  Not coming back to this location.  The one on 215 and Jones is better."
1,"For the price, four stars. If it were more expensive three stars. I had the calamari and veal parm. Both were good. The bread was also very good.  If I could give 3.5 stars I would."
1,"Was really really really busy on sunday for dim sum but still everything was sooooo good, expect the duck. If it wasn't for the duck I would have given the place 5 stars. I highly recommend the shrimp dumplings, noodles, and pork & corn dumplings. Great staff, friendly and reasonable price."
1,"I swear I was just going to have a bite.....I ended up eating more than my half of the ice cream sandwich goodness.  Home made cookies....about 8 or more different types.  We tried the white chocolate macadamia nut and chocolate chip with walnut....and both were good but I preferred the chocolate chip with walnut since it wasn't quite as sweet.  They serve Thrifty ice cream, which I've been told is the best....you'll have to try it out and judge for yourself.  Overall very simple but creative concept and you can't really beat the price of $3 for two cookies and a scoop of ice cream =)"
1,"Onion soup had delicious gruyere cheese.\n\nSteak was filling and the blue cheese dressing was great! \n\nThe servers were fast and very professional.\n\nA great choice for a classic restaurant. \nIf it's busy, don't expect to see the bellagio fountains from the outside patio...."
1,"Ok, This place is expensive. Like $50 bucks for 1 kid 2 adults and that's just to walk in.  Plus the planetarium and any extras.  \n\nOn the other hand, it was a full day worth of fun and exploration.  Totally worth it just make sure to bring the hand sanitizer."
1,"We had a wonderful 15 day tour to Turkey with Mill Avenue Travel. It was our first experience taking a tour, as we usually travel on our own. The group was small 7 including our 3. The hotels and meals exceeded our expectations. The tour guide and driver were super! We saw about 20+ sites museums, mosques, churches, archaeological. Overall, it was very good and we highly recommend Mill Avenue Travel."
0,"this place sucked ass!my ass would have tasted better.\n1)the false advertisement of late night dim sum\n2)they couldn't make a smoothie because it was apparently busy trust me it wasn't\n3)the lemonade wasn't fresh it was Brisk\n4)their credit card swipe machine didn't work\n\nThey were trying to sell lobster for $28/lb and the won ton soup tasted like the tea, the fried rice had a foul smell and the shrimp was chewy didn't taste fresh.\n\nWhat a waste of a $50 meal. It put me in such a foul mood that even though I was hungry after I couldn't be bothered eating after that I just didn't want to be disappointed.\n\nThe decor was cheesy.Don't go here!!!!!"
0,"The three hour tour. I vow to never shop at this store ever again as there customer service is on par with the Department of Motor Vehicles. \n\nLast Sunday I called to verify the price of an item, a iPod Touch 8GB, and to also verify that it had a $50 gift card. Specifically asked if it was a gift card or a Fry's card and the girl told me it was a Fry's Card. So I spent an hour loading up my cart with items to pay and pick up at the store.  Shopping cart won't work - I keep getting an error. Call the store and explain and the gal does it on her computer so I recite the 10 items and item numbers. She says \""Oh I got an error.\"" Yea...well just like me. She does it again from the beginning...error again. Goes to get a supervisor and we go through the whole dog and pony show again...twice. Same result error. They tell me that they will go and get all of the items together and put them on will call and I can come pay at the store. They will call me when ready. No one ever calls. \n\nI call the next morning to see what happened. Talked to the specific super from the day before, says sorry about the call, but yes all items are on will call. I ask if at same price and deals and am told yes. \n\nDrive my happy a$$ all the way across town and guess what...yea, nothing on will call. Wait 20 minutes and the box comes up. Agent tells me that not all items are on the same price. Ugghh..specifically asked that in my call. Goes to talk to someone and 10 minutes later comes back and says no. Fine leave that item out. Rings it up and I ask about the gift card...yea you guessed it \""What gift card.\"" Same fire drill and I explain it all again in detail to him and gave the guys name I talked to on the phone. 10 more minutes a supervisor comes over and asks. Have to repeat the same story AGAIN. \n\nGrowing impatient as this deal is narrowing on 2 3/4 hours in total plus a 25 minute drive here and back. 15 more minutes of waiting and I tell the Agent, \""Dude this is just taking too long. Just take out the iPod Touch and I'll pay for the rest and go. Guy gets nervous and says ok just a minute AND LEAVES. \n\nA \""manager\"" came over a few minutes later. This is when it goes over the top. This stocky bald headed white guy approaches me and get this...he puffs up and says to me \""Is there a problem here?\"" Are you friggin' kidding me! Well yea, with your arrogant and aggressive puff up and comment, well yea there was an issue and now it is a problem. This from a \""Manager\"" no less. I geared for a comment, but then bit my lip and just said, \""You know what, this process has been far too painful and I just want to go now, so take the item off so I can leave.\"" This arrogant tool, gives me the passive-aggressive mean spirited \""Just trying to help\"" line before turning away. His arrogance was almost like he was happy he won this apparent battle in his mind's eye. Ridiculous! Yea you won...you won me spending my $400.00 using Amazon Prime\"" you idiot. \n\nOne last SNAFU for me was when the supervisor comes back and hands me a VOID receipt...yea you guessed it again, he voided the entire order and not just the iPod Touch taken off as I requested (all in front of the \""Manager\"" too I might add). Walked out completely empty handed and drove home.  \n\nThe three hour tour. I vow to never shop at this store ever again as there customer service is on par with the Department of Motor Vehicles."
1,"Burgers are so trendy these days and you don't find me complaining! The hamburgurlar and I have one thing in common: we both love burgers! It's my cheat food any day of the week. Give me a burger, fries (and maybe even a milkshake) and I'm one happy girl. Granted, I don't eat my favorite meal every day of the week, which is why it's such a special treat when I do. Being a huge fan of Roaring Fork and Salty Sow, I was very excited to give Hopdoddy Burger Bar a try. The verdict? Folks, they did it again! \n\nHere's how it works: \n\nThere are three ways to enjoy a meal here. You can post up at the bar, you can dine in or you can get take out. Whichever option you chose, you will start by first going up the counter and ordering your meal. If you plan on dining in, once you order, the server shows you to a seat so you don't have to fight other patrons to score a table. The server will then bring the food out to you and you can enjoy your meal! \n\nNow on to the food. The burgers are why you come here, but they do have other delicious food as well! I especially love the Classic Cheeseburger and french fries, but the cous cous is delicious, as is the Kale Salad with Baby Kale Leaves, Arugula, Feta, Watermelon, Avocado, Sunflower Seeds, Pickled Red Onions and Pomegranate Vinaigrette. Actually, all of there salads looked delicious. While I love the Classic, they also have several funky burger options, such as the Buffalo Bill with Bison, Blue Cheese, Frank's Hot Sauce, Apple-Smoked Bacon, Sassy Sauce, the El Diablo with Angus Beef, Pepper Jack, Caramelized Onions, Habanero and Serrano Chiles, Salsa Roja, Chipotle Mayo, an Ahi tuna burger, turkey burger and veggie burger, etc, etc. There's a burger for all palettes here! \n\nNow let me talk about my other favorite part of the meal. Mmmmm....milkshakes! Oh yes, they have milkshakes here and a.m.a.z.i.n.g ones at that! I had the Nutella and Chocolate pretzel and yes my friends, it's as good if not better than it sounds. I might just stop in for a milkshake one of these days, but then I don't think I could resist a burger to go with it!"
1,"Fabulous food and AWESOME atmosphere. Perfect place to take your kids or have a little date. ;) The only thing that is upsetting is that once you fall in love with something on the menu, it always gets taken off. I have had probably 3 or 4 dishes that I have loved over the years that are just no longer available."
0,"just was trying to find a bite to eat for lunch, they're nearby, so I tried to check out the menu online to order something or at least see what they offer. Menu on their website was not working, so I figured I would try and run over there and take a peek to order something to go. The lady who I spoke to, who was all the way back in the bar as there was no greeter, was pretty rude when I asked about a menu. Let her know I was just wanting to check them out, and her demeanor totally ruined it. Guess I'll just look somewhere else :("
1,"Great sandwiches! Open late! \n\nI've been here a couple of times.  One time had to skip though because the line was five times as long as I had ever seen it.  But the sandwiches are totally worth it.  I got the Chipotle Chicken Avocado and it was amazing.  Ate half of it later and it was still good and flavorful.  \n\nAfter a late night, we called to see if they deliver. Sadly no.. they don't."
0,"if it weren't for the decent beer selection, (second visit here and i had S.T. Count Hopula and Stone Smoked [vanilla] Porter) this place would get 1 star. \nWe had dang near the worst service in all the 32 years i have lived in Phx. being that there were only 2 other customers besides our party, on a Saturday @ lunch hour, the service was unacceptable. all the time it took and hassle from the kitchen about fish and chips resulted in a $13 plate of food that was worth about $4. I would have seriously considered a Big Mac if foresight were applicable.. it was that bad. \n\nanyway, stop in to quaff a beer if you're on the way to another spot, but dont come here with the exclusive intention of having a good time. chances are, it will elude you. \nas one reviewer claimed, there are better English Pubs in BF Egypt. He could very well be right."
0,"Decided to drop by and give this place a shot and was somewhat disappointed.  Upon entering the establishment the \""cook\"" was outside taking a nap at lunch table and woke up 10 minutes later when other customers started walking in!! \n\nI originally wanted to order the chicken wings but after realizing i was paying $7 for 8 wings made me realize how frozen and processed they were and the gentlemen there ended up telling me that they were WING DINGS.   As I perused the menu more I finalized my decision to the fried catfish and got nothing more than a basic un-favorful corn meal breading, that I had to drown in salt and hot sauce.\n\nLast BUT FOR-SURE NOT LEAST\n\nAs another women and I ate our food, a friend of the guy behind the counter walks in and ask him why they changed locations. For the life of me he should've just texted him the answer because he went into a in depth conversation about how other people running the restaurant left meat and fish out and they received several violations.\n\nDoubt ill do round 2"
0,"With all the hype of Bobby Flay and Mesa Grill I had high hopes for this restaurant even though it is a chain and in the middle of touristy Las Vegas.  The food was priced like a Morton's Steakhouse but not up to the standards.  The side dishes were small, not very good, and not well executed.  The entrees were prepared well, however the price is not worth it.  In my opinion I would skip over this place and go off the strip to a non tourist trap that is much better food, and much nicer environment.  The decor of this place is that of a TGI Fridays with a slightly more classy twist.  I have dined in a lot of find dining establishments and this did not meet my expectations in the least.  The $13 margaritas on the rocks tasted like it came from mix not made from scratch.  \n\nAlso to make a reservation for a Saturday night party of 5 took 2 managers to approve and an act of congress."
1,"I've gone here a few times for waxes and they've always been very thorough and far less painful than other waxing experiences I've had. This would be my go-to place, if not for their prices. The wax I get is advertised at $55 and up. I assumed mine would be $55 or $60. When I walked up to the desk to pay afterwards, my total was $75, before tip. I may have let myself go a bit but this seemed a bit high. It would have been nice to receive a little warning from the esthetician. \""Hey, I had to use extra wax to get everything so this one will cost you a bit more,\"" would have sufficed. After tip, this service ended up costing near $100. Seems a bit high for 15 minutes of their time."
0,"I've been here two different times, Once for a haircut and shave, another time for a \""trim\"". The first time the haircut was great, however after the straight shave my neck bled for days on end and looked like I had been mauled by a bear. You would have thought that was warning enough to stay away but after a few months I decided to go get a neck trim. Bad Idea. Apparently when you tell someone your growing your hair out and to leave the top and sides alone, In Russian it mean to cut EVERYTHING and leave it a little longer than normal. Then when you do ask for it to be fixed they talk crap about you in Russian. Bad Business. I should have spend the extra time and gas driving to my regular barber at 19th and greenway."
1,"Pretty sure I've never seen a menu that is so unique, diverse, while being delicious. Do not go here expecting your \""run-of-the-mill\"" menu. It's all a new experience, and a delicious one. A lot of care and thought has gone into the menu, however, if the standard \""meat and potatoes\"" is your thing, you should probably hit McDonald's. The tots are not really tots and change every day. It's always a treat to go to the Pig & Pickle."
1,always good and delicous.  Love the outside sitting to watch the belagio water show while enjoying my meal..  Love the skirt steak and fries!
0,"I purchased the day spa access here and honestly, it was NOT worth it! My husband and I are staying at the Venetian so I only paid $20 but even that was waaaaaay too much. I will admit I might be a bit of a spa snob but I've experienced  better spas, which was a major let down considering this is Canyon Ranch. The Aquavana rooms were just average. There was no music playing in any of the spa areas and the shower and after shower products were terrible! No flat irons, the blowdryers were seriously lacking. Again, I know those things don't matter to a lot of people, but for me, I want the entire experience to be perfection.... this sadly was not. It was just a huge let down. I felt more like I was in the after room of a gym somewhere in the midwest than a SPA in Las Vegas. For me, not worth the time or money."
0,"Food was absolutely horrible! Service was mediocre. It all tasted like frozen or out of a can - nothing authentic. Spent about $100 on two adult meals, two kids meals, one beer and one frozen margarita. What a waste of time & money. Don't bother going, even the food court was better."
1,"So this place was pretty neat.  We met my folks there for lunch on Saturday.   I am a huge fan of Le Grande Orange, so when they suggested it, I was pretty stoked to try it.   The restaurant itself has a modern yet organic feel.  The outside patio is just beautiful.  I would love to go there on a date with my Hottie and have a glass of wine by the fire place!  But I'll wait until fall =).  \n\nAbout the food, it was very good, no complaints. I had a homemade veggie burger and fries with Gruyere cheese.   The boys both ordered burgers and devoured them, so I assume they were good.  My Mom had the Short rib tacos and she raved about them, the server said that was there specialty and her favorite.   She also tried their white sangria which was pretty tasty too.   \n\nFor dessert we had a chocolate flourless cake served with pistachio gelato and whip cream.... Um, can I say... YUM!"
1,This is my favorite place to eat!!!!  The food is amazing!  Such good flavor!  The Penang curry with the forbidden rice is my very favorite meal. The place is a little off the beaten path but so worth the stop!
0,"I was excited to try the Meatball Spot but came away pretty disappointed.  The prices seem decent until you see how small the portions are.  The \""full\"" size salads are a joke and the sides are ridiculously small.  The garlic fries cost $6 and aren't even enough for one person.  I had the classic meatballs with spicy meat sauce and they were good, but they don't come with enough sauce.  And the bread that comes with them is small, hard, and not very good.  A cool concept that fails in the execution."
1,"I stay right down the street and love this location. It is only 85 cents for a 32 ounce soda. There is no bathroom for general use unfortunately, but that is common in a lot of places. The employees are pretty friendly and seem to enjoy their job. I love their two for a dollar hot dogs!!! That cannot be beat!"
1,"I was really glad we drove down here...their selection is huge. Especially if your looking for a special or fancy dog food. Our pooch recently decided he didn't want to eat dry food anymore...I experimented with freeze dried dog food and he seemed to like it so I was out on a search for that or anything that he'd eat! The staff was great at answering our questions and making suggestions. All while showing our furry son some attention with treats and scratchings. Fyi...There are coupons in the Pet Scene magazine, so what else would stop me from returning? Nothing! Chaos loved the rabbit that was up for adoption, he so wanted to play! Prices were fair. Store was organized and clean. Staff was really nice. I'll definitely be back!"
0,"My impressions are lasting ones is all I can say.  I ventured off to try Mrs. Whites yesterday and was very disappointed.  The service was horrible, out of half the menu at 5pm, and just unprofessional.  \n\nThe only bright spot was my fried chicken and black eye peas which was delicious.  \n\nThat being said someone needs to take the lead and get restaurant back on track."
0,"Great place for cold fries and slow service. Fish and chips came with very good fish, nice and hot. Fries were cold and clammy and were obviously prepped earlier and/or sat around waiting for an order to come in.\n\nThe wings were good though the server never brought share plates or napkins. The food runner brought the share plates and one napkin each, which I think is a bit modest for such a messy finger food. When the entrees came, we were never brought utensils or additional napkins.\n\nMaybe we could have complained but the server did not come by for over thirty minutes to clear the dirty plates,  refill our beverages or check on the table. We were on a busy aisle yet not one other staff member thought to clear our dirty plates that had been pushed to the edge of the table or refill our empty water glasses.\n\nRather bothered that they opened the sliding doors to the patio and are allowing the patio table five feet from us to smoke.\n\nGood looking menu, okay prices but I just can't justify returning here after such a lousy experience. No manager bothered to stop by the table even after we complained to our server."
0,"Alway out of something and what moles it worse is the charge 39cents more to use my. Debit card , this place need to get with it ."
1,"pretty cool drinks and good food! Was craving breakfast, but got there a few minutes after 12pm and had to stick with their regular menu( breakfast is served 6am to 11am, which doesn't make any sense in Vegas, but oh well, i am not the one to judge:) and a candy store in front of the restaurant - amazing:))"
0,"I like Trader Joe's, just not a big fan of this location.  It's an extremely small store and someone always seems to be crawling up your arse.  They got a weird parking lot too.  I drive a few more miles and go to the Traders located on McKlintock & Gaudalupe."
1,"I had the opportunity to spend last weekend in Vegas for my friend's birthday. This was a special trip, first time to Vegas since having my baby who is now two. And first time leaving the baby overnight. We had one night on the town and we wanted it to be fabulous! There are so many options for things to do in Vegas, and after much discussion and many yelp searches, we decided to start our night out with a special dinner at Michael Mina. \nWe are so happy that we did! I have had some amazing meals, but this one stands out as best meal ever. When arriving at the restaurant we were greeted by Jorge, the Manager. When making the reservation we shared that it was my friend's birthday and Jorge went above and beyond to make sure that we enjoyed our night. All of the staff were exceptional. We especially enjoyed our server, Miguel. \nWe had the tasting menu with the wine pairing. The food and wine were paired to perfection. Every course was amazing. I can go on about each one, but I would suggest you experience Michael Mina's for yourself. It is hard to pick a favorite course, but the ahi tartar was amazing. If you are looking for a memorable dining experience when in Vegas I highly recommend a night at Michael Mina's. While I am sure everything on the menu is as delicious as what I had the opportunity to indulge in, the signature tasting with the wine pairing was perfection. Splurge and enjoy!"
1,"Ohana has to be the most customer-oriented salon in the valley.  They work so hard to please their customers by being both supremely professional and unstuffy-comfortable.  They're all just so darned nice!  I was a customer there for over a year, getting both great cuts and color until recently when my schedule forced me to find something closer to home.  Every interaction I had with every member of their staff was always like dealing with a longtime friend who also happens to be highly trained.  Their profession clearly isn't a game to them.  They take everything very seriously - from the design of the salon portraying the stylish yet casual feeling they want, to the classes they take and competitions they enter (and win) to stay on top of their game, to the inspections they submit themselves to from Aveda that scrutinize everything from how the merchandise is displayed to how the towels smell.  Most importantly, they know how to give you great hair every single time you walk out of their salon.  I can't think of a single stylist there I wouldn't trust my hair to.  I know that no salon closer to me will be able to fully replace them, but if 5th Ave isn't too far for you, maybe you can take advantage!"
1,"The interior is warm and bright, fairly busy on a Friday night. Our waitress was on the overly-friendly side of the spectrum, but not offensively or annoyingly. She helped clarify what is in the ambiguously title rolls. Offhand I cannot remember exactly what we ordered, but we made spicier   selections because I was hoping to overcome my deadened taste buds (due to a cold). Whatever we chose, it worked! Everything was really delicious, fresh, and full of flavor. It is moderately cheap, too. We sat enjoying our food for around 2 hours and it was very relaxing. \n\nOverall, this is the best sushi experience I've had here in Pittsburgh, in/around the city. I'm excited to go back and try out new things."
1,"This place is a little bit of a ways away from me, but I needed to take a break from Teharu, so we headed here for happy hour. They had some great specials, and it looked like they renovated the place since the last time I went there. Prices are good at $6.50 average per roll. My bf and I ordered 4 different rolls, an appetizer and spicy udon pasta and our bill was under $50. Any sushi dinner under $50, I'm a fan. (Blue Wasabi 2 drinks 2 appetizers 1 roll $70= not a fan)"
1,"My ablsolute favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  I love the rib eye w/ Creamed spinach & a baked potato.  De-Lish!!   I used to go in at least every other week, somewhat less often these days, money being what it is, but the gals at the bar are more than just eye candy (although we DO sit at the bar  ;-) ), they also make a killer Martini.  Off the strip and well wort the trip!!"
0,"Ate lunch there yesterday.  Prices are out of sight for this ole Texas boy.  Back home lunch usually costs us about $15 and we can hardly walk from being so full.  Here the bill was $27 and only one of us had a coke with lunch.   Meat was tough and had no favor what so ever.  Wife's platter was a little better but not up to Texas standards.\nIf you're going to call yourself a \""Tex-Mex\"" resturant you ought to know about real Tex-Mex food.  Service wasn't up to standard either.  Had to ask for more chips and salsa and didn't get a two coke until he delivered the bill.  He had walked past our table more than twice while my glass was empty.  I will stay home next time I'm in the mood for Tex-Mex and make it myself."
1,Been there many time and been a great experience every time. Last year I even celebrated my birthday there and I also got a sombrero that I got to take home.\n\nThe service is always fast even if they are super busy all the time and they are friendly. The DJ make the experience even better and they always play good music.\n\nThe food is great and my all time favorite is the salmon with the mango salsa it is to die for.\n\nThe Sunday specials are very good and I love the fact that you can buy the salsa they have on site.\n\nDrinks are ok but a few times I went there and they tasted a little like plastic nit sure why but I advise them and they made me another one right away.\n\nAnother downfall is that the bathroom is in the basement so if you're on the 2nd floor and u had a few drinks make sure to hang on to the railing.\n\nAll around food and service is awesome and I am super excited about the new one opening in Laval soon
0,"I bought new tires for two of my vehicles and figured I should get the alignment checked even though neither car was pulling or showing signs of needing an alignment. Network Automotive told me that both cars needed to be aligned. The first car now pulls to the right and the second car's steering wheel ended up 30 degrees off center when driving straight. I brought the second car back in and they fixed the misaligned steering wheel, but I had to wait over 2.5 hours again, with no apology from Network Automotive for not getting it right the first time. I feel like I need to take both vehicles somewhere else now and pay for a proper alignment."
1,"Whenever I'm in the Phoenix area I make it a point to come to Daily Dose.  The Green Chili Chicken Enchiladas are always great and the cilantro lime dressing is light and flavorful on salads.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"
1,This place is Amazing the owners are great the food is Amazing cold beer and all family oriented a matter of fact I'm watching football and eatting with one of the owners and his daughter doesn't get better than that
0,"Reasonable rates isn't enough to tempt me to return!\n\nI can forgive the screaming kids in the hallways; par for the course of a family lodging. I can forgive the nearly endless lines for check-ins; par for the course of attracting a lot customers with reasonable rates. I can forgive the dumpy condition of the rooms and hallways; par for course of high-volume, high traffic, and high usage.\n\nWhat I CANNOT forgive, at any rate I would pay, is the SCREAMING PARENTS during the day and middle of the night (there is just no excuse for that), CANNOT forgive NON-SMOKING ROOMS that are super smoky-smelly, and the terrible parking."
0,"This place came highly recommended to us by a waiter at another restaurant (thanks for the complete disappointment Eduardo!).  These are the dishes I tried:\n\n- Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - was spectacular!  The flavors of this dish were very fresh and enjoyable\n\n- New Style Sashimi Salmon - was basically thin slices of poached salmon drowning in sesame oil\n\n- Albacore Sushi - thin slice, nothing special...\n\n- Salmon Sushi- thin slice, nothing special...\n\n- Spicy Tuna Roll- wasn't spicy and the nori wrap was gummy\n\nOverpriced and completely not worth it.\n\nAnd my new pet peeve - DO NOT wipe the table down to prep for the next customer while I am still sitting at the table waiting for my check.  Clearing the table is fine, but seriously?  It's completely RUDE and I think after we dropped $200.00 and only took up about 45 minutes of their time, they could have waited- especially since there were plenty of empty tables around us.  Will never go back."
0,"This hotel is from the people who brought you the Artisan.  Club vibe.  Pool party with about 12 people and a DJ in the common pool area.\n\nRooms show a lot of wear and tear, but clean.  One of the two A/C units in the room only blew hot air.\n\nIn-Room amenities were scarce.  2 big towels, 1 hand towel, 1 washcloth.  Had to call front desk for drinking glasses.\n\nPlanes overhead every 4 minutes or so.\n\nStay here if you plan on spending most of your time at the pool.\n\nWouldn't stay again."

1,"I'm not sure where these pictures r from. That being said, went to Mad Town for Easter weekend 'cause the kids r all home with mommy & daddy, so mainly just those of us that actually love spring on the isthmus r still chillin.  I used to love going to this place, so i went back.  Nice move on my part. I stayed on the adult side since little man is with grandparents ;-)  To much fun, no more yankkie my.... wait. Food, pool tables, bars, TVs, floor, bathrooms, bartenders all updated.  Went back for Easter brunch, lunch? not sure what time i made it back to see if I had dreamed it all.  Did I mention the bartenders?  Cypress Hill on Juke, hits from the ..... wait. I love to eat things that once moved, went for veggie selection per super loverly bartenders suggestion.  Did I mention the Bartenders? They rivaled any Downtown supper hottie, with no attitude.  I totally over tipped them all, even the dude was cool"
1,We  had read some very positive reviews about this place in Yahoo Travel.  What a great place to visit!  The chicken fried steak was huge and delicious! Outrageous portions!  A perfect place to hit after a day of Spring Training baseball.
1,"Not only does the place feature the ability and experience of making your own wine, but the place also sells all products and equipment for the home brewer too. The staff has always been fabulous to me and offer great advice in case I've got a question about a certain process. I've also gone to one of their sangria challenge nights, quite a fun experience where you'll get to make a jug of sangria with some strangers and then sample each team's to judge on different factors.\n\nSuch a great add to the heart of Scottsdale!"
0,"Beautiful bar and hotel ... but skip it for happy hour and watch out for deceptive wait staff.\n\nProblem with the Blue Hound is there are too many choices nearby to make coming back a possibility. It may feel cool, but a lot of other places nearby feel cool, too. It's worth a visit just to check it out, but then ... it will never enter your mind again.\n\nThe Whoohoos!! - Beautifully decorated, great feeling and vibe, as another reviewer stated. It feels like a nice change of pace for Phoenix restaurants. The poolside bar is awesome and I'd go back there before this place.\n\nThe Sad Pandas - Happy hour SUCKS. I work nearby and go out at least one night a week and the Blue Hound will not be on our rotation list. \""But why?\"" you ask ...\n\nSet the scene ... four women out after work. Not looking for dinner, just some snacks while we have a drink or two and catch up.\n\nPopcorn - sounds nummy! Not if you want more than two handfuls. For $6, we were delivered a teeny, tiny wooden bowl that you'd expect salsa to come in. In it was two medium sized handfuls of this caramel popcorn (and a lot of kernels and broken pieces). This should be given to the table gratis, if you're going to give something so small.\n\nDeviled eggs - Wow, the presentation was beautiful I felt like Gordon Ramsey must have perfectly placed and spaced the eggs on the plate. And the four of us, now totally stuffed from our half a handful of popcorn stare down at three deviled eggs. Good thing Maria was on a diet, of else we'd have to arm wrestle for who got the eggs.\n\nDrinks - not the worse priced, not the best. Problem was our waiter didn't seem to have a Fing clue about their unique lineup of beers. I asked for something light and summery - to which he suggest a \""summer shandy.\""\n\nAssuming this summer shandy was the same as every other summer shandy I've had (beer mixed with lemonade), I agreed to try it on the waiter's \""It's amazing\""\n\nWhat I was given haunts me in my dreams. A oddly shaped beer glass was delivered with a light, almost water color and a GIANT FREAKING CUCUMBER stuck in it. \n\nWas I supposed to put this on my eyes? The drink smelled like a combination of facial moisturizer and salad ... both appealing combos in a drink.\n\nThat's about when my friend found the drink in their table top menu and pointed out the $10 price tag and list of liquor. This was NOT a normal summer shandy and the waiter should have told me and either pointed to it in the menu and listed the price. Granted, $10 isn't horrible, but what if I was watching my money?  When someone is trying to spend my money to raise his bill and tip, be honest with me or I'll slam your tip and warn others to be wary of the wait staff at the Blue Hound.\n\nSo bottom line ... I think this place is worth a visit, but given my experience, I will not be returning on any regular basis."
1,"I have decided to write a review on Waverly Trainstation because on TV, I have just heard an interesting fact about it - it apparantly is named after Sir Walter Scott's main character of the same name in his novels. Neat huh?\n\nAnyway, Waverly is a cracking train station - its clean, open, well designed, nicely laid out and most importantly aways busy. There are loads of helpful staff etc, as well as a large selection of shops to keep you going if you end up staying here a bit longer.\n\nIt wouldnt be an understatement to say I love this place - when I return to Edinburgh, I always have a shiver down my spine as I enter Waverly. It's magical. What a great station."
0,"I went there the day of my wedding for the Special Occasion package. I had a manicure, pedicure, my hair done up and makeup done. The manicur and pedicure were lousy and she tore up my cuticles. The saving graces were my hair and make up which were exactly what I wanted."
0,My breakfast burrito was really good and it came out correct.  Here's the issue: I was ordering right at 11am when they stop serving food for 30 min to transition to lunch.  The waitress barked at me to hurry while I was telling her my order.  I guess I was slow on a Saturday morning in Vegas.   I'm sorry about that.  Next time I will definitely wait the 30 minutes for lunch.
1,Decided to treat myself and have some housekeeping service done for my house. I have a two story home and was not in the mood to do any spring cleaning. I emailed Clean Service Pro and was promptly contacted by Sandra to discuss what I needed and make an appointment. They arrived as scheduled and both went to work immediately. I was impressed with the attention to detail and how clean my house looked after they left. I will definitely use them again!
1,"I avoided this place all the way through my first year as I thought it looked and sounded expensive.  I was so wrong.  It offers delicious sandwiches, baguettues and paninis at surprisingly reasonable prices.  They have a massive range of fresh salad, meat, cheese and sauces to choose from.  Further, there's a great range of fresh bread, ranging from seeded, granary brownto soft, doughy white.  \nI usually go for the smoked turkey along with some lettuce, tomatoes and mayonnaise.  This only costs about \u00a33 along with a drink, and they're certainly not stingy with their fillings.  The staff are friendly and keen to let everyone know that their ingredients are mostly locally sourced and always fresh.  I definitely recommend Picnic Basket for a tasty, cheap lunch."
0,The food sounded great but wasn't executed well at all!
0,"On arrival we were told it would be 30 minutes before seats would be \navailable, but the same meal could be prepared for us in the kitchen. We opted for this alternative rather than wait which turned out to be a big, big mistake. We started out with the edamame appetizer. This represented our first and last experience with boiled salted soybeans - totally tasteless. My wife chose the halibut dinner while I requested chicken. She received two decent sized pieces of fish, but each was overdone. My chicken, cut into  inch cubes, was dry. Each entree included miso soup, noodles, veggies, rice and salad. The soup was hot, but everything else was  served cold. Service was affable, but slow."
0,"Disclaimer: My visit to Wally's was about three years ago, maybe things are better now. \n\nThis was the first time I had EVER taken one of my vehicles to a shop for anything other than an oil change, tires, or smog check. I do all my own work and well, for me, this was similar to dropping your child off at day care for the first time. I chose Wally's because I figured it would be cheaper than the dealer. \n\nMy car had an erratic idle during warm up, I did some of my own diagnostic work and narrowed it down to a few different things but I decided I didn't want to throw parts at it and surly Wally's could handle this situation. \n\nI dropped my car off and one of Wally's staff drove me back to work, I appreciated that. \n\nI got a call the next day and they said the car was ready to go. The bill was $500. Okay, a little more than I wanted to spend but at least it's running properly now....NOT! Whatever they did made the problem worse!!! how on earth could they tell me it was better?, that's beyond me. \n\nI took the car back, got another ride back to work, and this time they figured it out. Bad idle air control valve. Okay good this was one of the things that I thought might have been bad so at least we agree on that. \n\nSo not too excited that I had to take it there twice. But here's what really roasted my muffins. A few months ago I was looking through a Honda Accord chat forum and apparently this problem is extremely prevalent in these cars. These guys only work on Hondas and Acuras, why aren't they familiar with this problem? So in the end I feel like was probably overcharged for shop time considering that this should have been an easy fix for them. \n\nSix and twelve months later Wally's called my cell phone (Hey I'm on the 400 minutes a month plan, quite wasting my minutes!) to \""remind\"" me to come in for maintenance. Ugh I know when I need to do these things and I'm not coming back here to have them done. \n\nSo why the two stars? Well I really did appreciate the rides back to work and at the end of the day they never tried to up sell me on further repairs that I didn't need, but I don't think I'll go back there."
1,"I can't believe I did not go here sooner. The stand is right down the street from my neighborhood. The barista who served me was very nice and cheerful. She took the time to explain what some of the more exotic items on the menu were and had a few recommendations since it was my first visit. The Snowy Mocha I had was stellar. She went through a few questions - non-fat, soy, etc. When I told her \""always full fat\"" she asked if I would like whipped cream. Yay! I drove away with a perfectly yummy concoction and a chocolate covered bean. It was a great way to start the day."
0,"Let me start off by saying the Health Department needs to visit this place. Doh sushi has a serious problem with temperature control, they must store their food at unsafe temperatures. Trust me I came here with an opened mind and its not hard to please me with sushi, I love it regardless but honestly STAY AWAY. I'm calling it now, the next salmonella food poisoning spot.\n\nAmbiance: \nCute the decor, dark dimmed, with twinkle lighting. Rustic, felt warm and inviting. Looks like a nice place for a date but looks aren't everything....\n\nSeaweed Salad: \nWhen I sit I automatically order seaweed salad. I had high hopes for this place because their seaweed salad was delicious. Lightly sauced and it still had that crunch of freshness, but you can't really ruin seaweed salad.\n\nBaked green muscles: \nI should say NOT SO BAKED, so my first encounter with their issue of bad temperature. Please refer to my photo, notice that the mayo isn't baked at all. When the order first came out I thought it was a slice of cheese on muscle, and the muscles were cold. Told our server, she apologized and sent out another order, the worst part. It was exactly the same, cold and not baked. \n\nNigiri Salmon Sushi: \nYou know when you leave raw fish out for awhile and then store it at unsafe temperatures it develops this opaque slime layer. Yeah, totally what they served us. The salmon was slimy and not fresh at all. The rice to fish ratio was more rice than fish. Honestly when a sushi restaurant starts cutting corners to gain more profit, their food sucks.\n\nNigiri Yellow Tail Sushi:\nAlso slime layer, more rice to fish ratio. Wasn't happy.\n\nNot so hot Tea:\nNot sure how the hell you mess up hot tea. Okay I understand you don't want to burn customers but warm closer to cold tea isn't considered hot tea. \n\nService:\nNot so great, our tea was never hot. Our server forgot orders, never brought orders out, brought orders that weren't ours out, and we had to send back an order. \n\nLast Note:\nSuper fail sushi night. As you can see, I barely ordered anything. It was so awful I was afraid to continue to eat because I didn't want food poisoning."
0,"Perhaps it was my point of reference from a recent trip to the East Coast, but Brit & Chips did not live up to the reviews. I was disappointed by the sole with the sour cream and onion batter. The quality of the ingredients from Brit & Chips were questionable. I was overwhelmed by the grease and underwhelmed by the lack of freshness of the fish. The sole was also overcooked. The chips were slightly soft and not as crispy as fries could be.\n\nOn a more positive note, the waitress was very hospitable. Both of the wait staff were very friendly and patient with our indecisiveness."
0,"This place gets a C+ (good thing I gave extra credit points earned with the bathroom presentation).\n\nPros:\n1) Aesthetics - the restaurant looks great, the plate presentation looks great, even the bathrooms look great. Love the mosaic tile-job in the bathrooms.  Great color scheme overall.\n2) Location - it's in the Aria...can't get any closer...and if you are staying in the Cosmo/Aria/Monte - no cab fare!\n3) Learn spanish while visiting the bathroom.  Seriously...spanish 101 cd is going on while you sit/stand/wait in the bathrooms.....think....loungy music when you get up from the table...stroll 100 paces...enter bathroom...and you hear \""Autumn...Autumn........Beer...Cerveza..........Money...Deniro...\"".  You get the point.  \n4) Service - Our waitress was on top-of-it.  She got our refills, bill, etc. at just the right time.\n\nCons:\n1) Bartender needs to go.......and here's why:\n\nI tended bar p/t for nearly 8 yrs.  I give a little credit to bartenders when they are a) \""in the weeds\"", b) making 5 different kinds of blended/fu-fu drinks c) dinner rush. I expect a Vegas bartender in an upscale hotel restaurant to be able to take a drink order and deliver it to the party within a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe main bartender looked as though he was so buried you'd think he was working a night club during the main 1030-11p rush.  I looked around and saw every spot at the bar was taken (it only sat ~18peeps) but we were the only peeps standing around asking for a drink.  The tables were full but not packed so he wasn't busy with the server's request.  There were 2 other bartenders working as well.   Then the servers were bringing out dishes for the patrons that were seated at the bar so he wasn't busy with that.  The bartender kept going back and forth between us, the patrons at the bar, the servers running around...you get the point.\n\nWe all ordered our 3 drinks total at the same time.  After 15 minutes...he had provided 1...a glass of wine.  We didn't order anything complicated...let's see...glass of red wine, Jeiger-RedBull (as a drink), and a Capn-Coke....nothing too crazy.  No chicky Cosmo, no fu-fu frozen pina-what-cha-ma-call-it.  3 easy drinks.  I looked at the bartender...and he was sweating it...again...not sure why.  \n\nThen my buddy says...hey buddy....can we get the Jeiger-RedBull and Capn-coke.  He is like...oh...oh yea.... no apology, no offer of a freebie or a discount.  another 10 minutes he came with our drinks.  We paid...and about 1 min later we were seated.  \n\n2) Prices.... I know to expect to pay more in a hotel, I know to expect to pay more in a Vegas hotel....and yet I know to expect to pay more in the \""latest and greatest hotel in Vegas\"".....but come on.  Seriously.  $17 for 1 single lamb chop?  $16 for 2 mini cheeseburgers?\n\n3) Portions are small...even for a Tapas-style restaurant.  Each person will need to order minimum of 3 dishes each."
1,"Great club, got to see Redfoo of LMFAO guzzle Red Bull and vodka through a funnel. Vacation successful. Get here early!! It does get crowded."
0,"My wife and I have been going to Houston's for about 5 years, as time goes bye Houston's service/ food has really taken a back seat to the quality food/service we were used to. The last two times for dinner my wife and I love the prime rib French dip we were told both times they were sold out of the prime rib, so we opted for the Hawaiian steak(yuk) ask for medium rare it was over cooked n the taste was awful, as we were choking down the Hawaiian steak we watched waiter after waiter serving the same prime rib French dip to customers after we have almost finished are dinner, The service the last two times there has been just terrible, I know I won't be back, to all u Houston lovers enjoy, but don't settle for less like I did, Houston's has gone down hill, peace, John"
0,"Thai food for white people.\n\nWe ordered a 10/10 spice level and my three year old daughter ate it without difficulty (as did my in-laws who can barely handle the spice level of salt). So, we asked for some fresh Thai peppers and they brought sauces instead (red flag). When we again requested peppers they wanted to charge us an extra $1 for the spice in the food they failed to deliver in the first place.\n\nHad the flavor profiles been more interesting I may have been much more forgiving, but it tasted like average, over-sauced Pittsburgh Thai.\n\nThe coup de grace was actually that we were charged an unearned 18% gratuity because we were a large group.\n\nAs a note, the corking fee for beer is $0.50/bottle, not $5 as some had previously mentioned."
1,"This course is very beautiful and pretty reasonable. I found that the greens were a little rough (almost like sand). But this was during the mid summer season, so that might be the reason. Fun course with plenty of difficulty for the average golfer, such as myself."
0,"If you're \""young\"" (under 35-to me that's young, I'm 46) and you really don't know the difference between a 4 star hotel and Motel 6, then you probably would like this place.  I stayed here for a week while waiting for my condo to close escrow and the longer I stayed here, the more I noticed all the \""little things\"" that are wrong with this place. \n\nOriginally this was built as a Holiday Inn Express.  I used to live in the area and I remember they built this from start to finish almost \""overnight\""....it went up super fast,  and it shows.  The tile in the bathrooms look as if it was installed by an eight grader, the paint job is so sloppy, there's paint all over everything...I don't think they even bothered to tape anything off at all.  Looks like someone painted it all freehand.  \n\nThe towels have a terrible chemical smell, and aren't soft and comfy at all.  The beds squeak and move around all over the floor, the A/C is loud and the temperature balance is either cold as ice or hot and stuffy and has a really odd odor. \n\nI don't think they insulated this building at all, you can hear people through the walls, the floors, in the hallways, at the pool, on the streets.  Annoying.    \n\nThe windows are absolutely filthy and you cannot open them.  Seems like that should be some sort of \""fire-code\"" violation to me, but I'm no expert on that.  \n\nThe place is crawling with party goers on the weekends and this place is SUPER noisy and there is absolutely nothing in the lobby or the bar/restaurant areas to absorb the sound, whatsoever.  The lobby is on the 2nd floor so you either have to take the stairs up or wait on the elevator just to check in.  The lobby is cramped and the traffic patterns are ill-conceived, which makes it difficult to navigate around all the party people and arriving guests wanting to inquire or check in and people going to their rooms and/or the elevators.  Its a very small \""cross roads\"" for all traffic.  Like I said, its very \""ill-conceived\"". \n\n But if you're not fussy and really don't know or care what the difference is between a \""fine\"" hotel and this party palace, then you'll probably not notice or care about these things.  I find most \""young people\"" just take what is thrown at them without the slightest bit of personal reference.  Some do and I'm sure they're not the ones' staying here.  I chose it strictly for location's sake.\n\nIf you want to take a Taxi to anywhere, be SURE to specify what kind of taxi you want to take.  I ordered a cab to take me to a bar way downtown Phoenix. They ordered me a \""luxury\"" livery service and it cost me $35.00 for a 6.6 mile trip according to google maps. And I don't think this guy was actually legally licensed as a taxi service (which is a MAJOR FELONY...in case you didn't know this...it is a felony to act as a taxi service without proper licensing authority) there were no visible signs of any licensing whatsoever in this guy's vehicle.  So if you were to be involved in a traffic accident with an unlicensed taxi service, you could probably end up owning this dump after all the legalities were settled....guess that could be a plus?  Depends on how you look at I suppose.\n\nOn the plus side, the beds were surprisingly comfortable, the pillows aren't feather, they seem like just your ordinary foam pillows, which I have never really liked.  The linens aren't very high quality, probably around 300 to 400 thread count or less, so don't expect anything great there.  But I guess, for the price of the room, you get what you pay for.  \n\nThere was no refrigerator in my room, not sure if other rooms have one, but it was pretty inconvenient not to have one.  Being here for a week, it would have been handy.  \n\nThe fixtures in the restroom were wonky...the cold water handle was clearly not tightly secured to the counter top.  The shower handle had about two inches of play in it, which was pretty annoying and the \""sunflower\"" shower head seemed to drain the power right out of the water pressure.  Luckily I travel with my own shower head and I replaced it with mine and the pressure was terrific.  \n\nThe waste paper baskets are made of chromed tin and when you throw away a plastic bottle or anything rigid, it makes a terrific noise! LOUD!  Obviously a \""were going for pretty instead of smart\"" instinct in design.\n\nThe mirror in the bathroom was circular with the lighting behind a frosted glass ring surrounding the mirror.  So when you turn on the lights and look into the mirror, your eye balls reflected back this white ring making your eyes look like something out of a John Carpenter movie.  It was quite a shocker at first and really quite disturbing, but I got used to it.  \n\nI think this hotel was designed and built by and for children."
0,"Terrible, terrible service. Waited 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us. The place looked messy with dirty tables that were not cleared. Rag was laying on the table with a spray bottle next to our table. \nThe light fixture above us was dirty and debris was literally falling on us while we sat there. Waitress forgot about us several times. Asked for things. Never got them. Didn't even acknowledge that she had not brought things to the table. Owner seemed to be present, but only worried about tending to the drawer. \nWhile we were there another couple who had been waiting got up and left. We should have done the same. In the end we wasted $60 and will not return. \nThe food was mediocre. The teriyaki had no flavor and was bland. One positive. They use romaine in the salad, not iceberg lettuce."
0,This place is not good sushi and the prices don't reflect the service.  I went with 2 friends and the waitress made a huge deal about my friend returning her cucumber salad that looked a few days old.  Will not be going back.  Smith's on Valle Verde makes better rolls!
0,I go to North Scottsdale Gold' Gym. The gym and the equipments are excellent. Me and my husband are enrolled in 2 year contract. \nWhile signing the contract they said we have to pay 23 per person/month. They never mentioned that there is some semi annual fees in between.. And I have been charged 37.99 and 40 for my husband this month. \nBEWARE OF THE HIDDEN CHARGES THEY HAVE. Soon I am going to cancel my membership.
1,"Best pizza downtown. Hands down. Finally a pizza joint that rises above the rest. Pop Up Pizza is as artful as Pop Up Art House in Henderson. Think a hybrid between Neapolitan style and New York style. Exceptional ingredients that are perfectly portioned with the crust. Oh the crust, light, yet firm, a with a nice crunch on the edge yet soft and pillowy inside. The crust in the center holds up to the toppings with ease. By the slice, by the pie, heck buy the slice or buy the pie. Four styles to choose from with an additional 4 on the way in the next few weeks...including a vegan variety. An entiere pie will run you about $22, by the slice-$3.50 Pop Up Pizza is located on the south end of The Plaza, just as you enter the front door from Main St. Run, do not walk to this place. Soon the lines will be out the door, up Fremont Street, then all the way down Las Vegas Blvd to the Secret Pizza Place at the Cosmo. Yeah, it's that good."
0,"Came here on a Saturday because my Tire Pressure light kept coming on even after I've put air in it at Chevron last week. \n\nCame in and spoke with Marc about my concern. He advised that maybe the tire pressor reader at Chevron wasn't accurate and we can check and put air in it today and if it comes back on again they can lift it up and check for any leaks. \n\nMy back passenger tire was at 16lbs when they put air in to make it 33lbs. Well, the next day the Tire Pressure light came on once again. I got real nervous and put air in it at Chevron and checked the pressure, it was at 20lbs. I brought it in and spoke with Marc. He said it was pretty busy today & if I can come back in an hour and a half. \n \nI came back they took my car and few minutes later they said nothing was wrong with my tire and it had adequate amount of pressure on all tires. I advised them that I had put in air in it not to long ago and was at 20lbs when I checked it. They still insisted nothing was wrong. Ok? \n\nThe next day my Tire pressure light came on again. I took it to Discount tires and they found a large nail in my tire. \n\nSo thanks Firestone for the free air you put in my tires and thanks for not properly examining them. Marc was a nice guy though he squeezed me in even when it was pretty busy. But I probably will not come to this place with any car issues."
1,"Four stars huh? Well yeah...this place deserves it today. I had a couple rolls they make called the CLT roll and the Captain's Roll which were very tasty indeed. I happen to like spicy...both of these rolls have a common spice in using jalape\u00f1o peppers either sliced or diced. In addition, the tuna in both dishes was of good flavor and texture. I should clarify that the Captains Roll wasn't really a roll...it was more of a sashimi with yellowtail tuna in ponzu sauce, with sliced jalape\u00f1os on top.\n\nEither way, it was exactly what I was looking for in a lunch. Consider this fact as well that this is a sushi place, IN AN AIRPORT, IN NORTH CAROLINA...not what you are expecting to find down this way.\n\nPrices were reasonable for airport food. The wait staff was both attentive and friendly. Interesting considering that they seemed to be employed by HMS Host and I have had rather unpleasant dealings with that company in the past. Either way, I had a waitress/bartender that did an excellent job of both making recommendations and ensuring I had what I needed to enjoy a great meal..\n\nI have eaten here a couple other times in the past and the food/delivery of service have been consistent experiences.\n\nWould definitely recommend this place to anyone with an hour or longer layover at the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport."
1,"A-MAZ-ING!  Four of us had such a great experience here last weekend!  We called for a 7pm reservation, and upon arrival we were seated at a prime people watching spot towards the front of the restaurant.  \n\nAfter reading some Yelp reviews, we knew we would be ordering the Kobe burgers and adult mac and cheese sticks.  We weren't steered wrong. Yum!  And the presentation was very cute.  I tried the tomato soup, which was flavorful, creamy, and just the right temperature.  It came with two mini grilled cheese sandwiches - the perfect compliment to the soup and very filling.\n\nFor desert we ordered the donuts, which were presented on a stick with two sauces and warm.  Soooo good!  \n\nSure, it's a little pricey but not outrageous and well worth the splurge.  Service was a little spotty with several different servers, but that was easily overlooked because of the ambiance and food.  \n\nI'll have to come back the next time I'm in town!"
1,"First time stay in here, I was impressed.  Clean room, comfortable atmosphere and courteous staff...its value is beyond my expectation. Highly recommended!!!"
0,"The pizza is good, but this is the second time I have ordered and pay for a two topping pizza only to receive on topping. Luna pizza is either attempting to rip me off or they simply don't know how to make a pizza from the order. I really can't say I will be eating here ever again. I live almost a minute away and tip well is it that hard to want to give me what I ordered?"
1,"This is probably one of the best pharmacies in Tempe. I was going to the CVS on mill for a while but had a terrible experience there and they only had the medicines I needed every once in a while, so I ended up here. It's a bit farther up the road, but I don't mind, it's totally worth it. The staff is attentive and helpful, even greeting you when you walk in the door. Everything there is priced as average and the wait time at the pharmacy is relatively short. I was able to get what I needed in a timely manner without having to pay too much. I found some really awesome snacks while I was there too. Oh, and one of their guy pharmacists was really cute too (I think his name was jeremy or something like that?) Super awesome place to go. Great service all around. Totally my go-to from here on out."
1,"I love Stinky's...$1 beers and the best wings I've had in Pittsburgh on special during all hockey and football games.  \n\nIf I have Spicy Garlic sauce from my wings left over, you will find me trying to eat it with my fingers.  It's that good."
0,"Arrogant arrogant arrogant!  So what if you sell porsche and Mercedes.  Looking at a used car is no reason to make someone feel that they are wasting your time.  I got the \""Here is our price, buy it or not....I have things to do\"" attitude.  I will NEVER return to that lot again...EVER.  Spend your money elsewhere."
0,"We came here last month to watch a boxing event.  The theatre is perfect for that type of event.  The stage is set in the round, so the stage is front and center.  However, the place is old and is in desperate need of a renovation.  The bar and bathrooms are located downstairs underneath the seating area and is very small.  It's a little inconvenient.\n\nThe food and drink options here are very limited as well....think cheap high school gymnasium type of deal.  Also, I wouldn't trust parking my car out in the lot during a show...the neighborhood is bad and sketchy.  The night we went we took an Execucar to/from the place....we didn't want to risk it.\n\nI would only come back to see a show that I don't want to miss...otherwise, I'd pass.\n\nReturn Factor - 30%"
0,"The room is luxurious and clean but the service.... THUMBS DOWN! Upon arriving, the staff seem friendly and courteous. Unfortunately they didn't have our reservation which we booked a week in advance with the confirmation number. The person helping us said \""hold on\"" and went to the back. She left us outside for LITERALLY 30 minutes until I went to another attendant and asked what was going on. That person went on the back to check and disappeared. We literally spent 2 hours there while no one was really helping us. Finally after getting a little crazy someone recognized that we needed to be help. They told us there was a mix up on the reservation but they have it now.\n\nI told them that they made us wait for 2 hours and they kept on apologizing. They said all they had for the night was a king size bed. I was like what??? I'm with another person... you can't give us a king size bed. Finally after another hour they found us a doubled bed room. They kept on apologizing for the inconvenience but didn't give no kind of compensation for all the trouble. It was such a headache! I hate people who apologize after they know they caused you so much trouble in the first place. If they really cared they could've came and helped us.\n\nAnyway... if your looking for a luxurious hotel, just to to the Venetian. It's the same floor plan and its a bit bigger!"
0,"French crepes are not the easiest food item to prepare and I certainly wasn't expecting Cordon Bleu quality. That said, I found the crepes to be overly thick and the filling, while tasty, too skimpy and thus overpowered by the crepes wrap. But it was the attitude of the owner that turned me off the establishment. I was in Pittsburgh visiting a relative with terminal cancer at the nearby hospital ; she had requested a breakfast crepes so I found Cafe Parisiennes through Yelp. We were in a hurry because of limited visiting hours. The sign said the Cafe opened at 10:00AM, which was when we arrived. We could see staff inside and asked if we could come in. The owner very curtly informed us they were still closed and might be ready \""in ten minutes\"" or so. After another ten minutes, we asked if we could wait inside because of the cold. Again the owner was brusque and not at all apologetic for being 20 minutes late opening - on a busy Saturday morning!! When I tried to engage him while giving my order, I found him to be taciturn and argumentative; it was clear his young staff were feeling very uncomfortable watching the exchange. This is not the kind of attitude for anyone in a service business and I would definitely not recommend this establishment to anyone."
0,I have ordered pizza from here a couple of times to be delivered. The last pizza I got I ordered the thin and crispy crust. The only thing they got right was the thin. You could not even hold a piece of pizza in your hand because it was so floppy. I will not be ordering from there again. I should have picked up a pizza from Papa Murphy's and baked it myself. It would've tasted better and been a lot cheaper!
0,"It's a cute little to-go for sandwiches and salad across the Acardia farm cafe which is a sitting down restaurant. The blond girl at the register is absolutely rude, loud an obnoxious. She does not have any manner at all. Talk to customers without please and thank you. She needs to learn how to speak and not bark.\n\nOn to the food, the sandwiches are small and a little pricy. Not worth all the claim about the turkey and brie. Just sandwich, slices of apple and brie. You can make it at home."
1,"Great flatbread, great beer and staff is very attentive and friendly"
1,I had not visted a Corleone's but moved recently & this was close. We went in on a Tuesday Night - & I heard the lady in front of me order the Tues.Special.  1 Reg Size Get 1/2 free - That seems like a plan. This was the BEST Sandwich I have had in years hands down. We shared a order of fries - Hand cut- Crispy and good- The Bread is so good on the Sandwich too. GREAT Deal- and GREAT Food. I'm a Fan (Esp on Tues Night) Yum
1,Always good food whenever I go there people are friendly especially kera and chealsea
0,This rental community does not offer its residences a recycling drop facility!
0,"I don't get it. \nEveryone from the west coast is always raving about the burgers at this place. Why?? We came by here last night...had the animal fries and the double-double and the flavor was blah. Fries were cold...sauce was eh. The burger itself just had nothing memorable about it. At all. Except for the fact that it made me sick. I've been up all night with horrific gas pains. I will NOT be coming back here. Maybe it's just this location. If I'm ever in Cali, I'll take a bite out of someone else's burger before I decide it's worth it to order my own."
0,"After checking out a laser show, rainstorm, the fountains and almost all the stores at Miracle Mile, it's time for tea.\n\nWe needed change and it had started raining outside.  I like Coffee Bean's Japanese Cherry and was amused to discover you can follow them on Twitter and Facebook.  What could a coffee shop possibly have to say?  I was curious to find them and check it out but disappointed that my tea was made wrong.  The water was poured boiled hot which scorched the tea bag making my tea bitter. I drank some of it anyway because it was getting really cold in Vegas and we had to leave the shops soon for our next adventure."
0,"Why do I keep going back to this place hoping that it will turn into something that it will never be? I can't tell you how many times I have wondered in here only to find that these clothes are worse than what one can find at Goodwill for 10x the price. Vintage things do not mean anything that was pulled out of a corner from 10 years ago. To the above reviewer, I can't believe you are OK with paying 10$ for a used Forever 21 blouse that probably retailed at 14$. Simply ridiculous prices for junk..don't even waste your time coming here there is a Goodwill up the street that has far better prices and items."
1,"I've found a new breakfast spot! I was wanting to try Bragg's as they offered a lot of vegan options. Ever since I found out I was lactose intolerant, I've stopped eating waffles and pancakes, and have always gone with a boring egg option as it's one of the few breakfast options that doesn't include cows milk. \n\nWe came here for brunch, it's a quaint little diner, with about 10 tables. They have a rotating desert fridge, which reminds me of the diners I went to as a kid and they had kitchy salt shakers of a different form on every table.\n\nI was torn with what to order as everything sounded good, so I asked my server what she recommended. She said the curry waffles were a good option, and same with the almond pancakes with strawberries and goat cheese. I ordered the waffle and my husband had the pancakes. Both were very good and we did not miss the dairy! The waffle was a perfect mix of sweet and savory with a hint of curry flavor, it really worked. My husband's pancakes were cooked well and were light and fluffy. The prices were reasonable too, two entrees and two iced teas for $20. I will definitely return!"
0,"Too bad you can't give ~zero~ stars!  I also purchased a Living Social voucher.  I would be willing to accept that they were overwhelmed by more cleaning requests than they could keep up with IF THEY WOULD JUST RETURN A PHONE CALL OR EMAIL!!!  I have left messages for over a week.  I have scheduled two cleanings online that they never called to confirm on.  I sent emails to the \""scheduling\"" email address posted on their site.\n\nI hardly ever give even slightly critical reviews...this business must be a scam...I don't get it."
0,"The food was just OK. The miso super super spicy, like noserunning spicy. \n\nService wasn't great. The table slightly smelled like a dirty cleaning cloth.\n\nAnd the WORST of all they had a DJ with super loud music. AYFKM? Who wants a DJ in a sushi bar/restaurant? It was just annoying."
0,"I found this place on Yelp when I was looking for a dinner spot close to Tempe Marketplace to catch a movie later in the evening. Per the other reviews, I thought it might be busy on a Friday night so I called two days in advance to make dinner reservations for 4 at 7:30. \n\nOur party of four arrived at 7:28pm and checked in with the hostess. I was initially relieved that I made the reservations because the place was packed! The hostess said they would come find us when our table was ready so we took a spot standing near the cute merchandise they have for sale and expected maybe a 10-15 minute wait. Luckily our conversation entertained us because before we knew it, 20 minutes had gone by and we were still waiting. We waited another 10 minutes before checking on our table since they were busy but when we did, we were informed that our table would be ready shortly since 5 tables were nearly done. Fine. As we continued to wait, we were approached by a very intoxicated woman and had to endure a very awkward conversation with her. Clearly not the restaurant's fault but maybe someone should have cut this lady off before we had to hear about how her father made french toast?! We finally finished our 50 minute wait and were taken to the bar side of the restaurant where we were placed one table away from the entertainment that evening. It was a middle-aged piano player who talked more than sang and was having a full on conversation with the table next to us. Had we not been waiting for 50 minutes already and didn't have a movie to make in an hour and 15 minutes, I would have demanded a different table.  At this point, I was hoping the service and food were going to make up for this rocky start. Unfortunately, it didn't get much better. \n\nOur waitress showed up after a several minute wait and took our drink order. She was clearly busy but definitely not overly friendly or accommodating. I cautioned my dinner guests that we would need to order ASAP if we ever wanted a chance to make our 9:30 movie and we all picked out our dishes and ordered the next time she came back to our table. Once we ordered and our drinks arrived, we were served garlic bread and I must admit, that was some of the worst garlic bread I've ever had. There was absolutely nothing special about it and it was like someone took out the fluffy, good part of the bread and seasoned the crust. Blah. \n\nBy the time our food arrived close to 30 minutes later, it was clear we had no chance of making our movie. The food was okay but I don't think even the best Italian food at this point would make me want to come back here. The piano guy finally took a break and we were able to have a nice conversation without yelling over him and just decided to enjoy our dinner guests rather than rushing. We didn't end up leaving until most of the place was cleared out (about 10pm) and don't recall ever being offer additional drinks while we chatted.  I do know my water glass was full all the time. At least they got that right. On the way out, we were thanked by 4 different people sitting at the bar as we left. Really? Where has the great service been all night? Apparently sitting at the bar. We will never be back."
0,"I literally created a Yelp login to warn people how this is the crappiest Auto Bell in America!! My wife and I forget how terrible this place always is, and trick ourselves every few months into going back because it's so conveniently located near our house. It's a virtual certainty your windshield will still have spots when you leave, your wheels will still be covered in brake dust and water marks from poorly wiping down the car will be everywhere. I've even returned to Auto Bell to show a manager of the poor workmanship and been told to hop in the infinitely long line to again mediocrely wipe down my sedan. Do. Not. Go. Here."
1,"Lunch time deliciousness! I came here because my friend wanted to go and introduce me to the amazing things on life like the teas and amazing service. We walked in and were seated immediately. They brought us means and my friend order me the orange tea which I should probably get the name of. I took a look at the menu and had not idea what to order, it all sounded delicious and I was starving. I ended up getting the same plate as him. It's beef curry and it comes with a side of rice. The sauce if a mix or curry and coconut milk and has a little spice to it. I couldn't finish mine but I wanted to. It was tender and mix perfectly with the white rice. Defiantly coming back."
0,I love the idea of the 50s style restaurant. But what I am not in love with is just a really bad greasy burger.\n\nWhen you go to a 50s style restaurant like this you expect better food. It should be cooked with quality and pride like they did in the 50s. Honestly smash burger is a much better Burger for the same or less money.\n\nThere are better places to eat a good burger. I would not recommend eating here if you want a really good burger. Only eat here if you want fast food ... That is expensive and very greasy
1,Love target! Great products and an amazing return policy!
1,"Philly cheese steak sandwiches in Vegas baby! Located on the southeast corner of Decatur and Alta, you can do some serious people watching here. No indoor dining area and no drive through, but yet somehow this place it getting a four star rating from GA. \n\nI ordered the #3, Steak and American cheese. 'Merica! Topped with grilled onions for good measure. It got better with every bite. Juicier and juicier with melted cheese all the way to the end. The French fries were hot and crispy. Next time I'll try the Cheese Whiz fries like JR got. They looked they could have been named after some crazy 80's band. They looked \""Totally Cheezy Awesome.\"" They have a sign that says they welcome you watching your food being prepared. So I did. It was kind of cool. They serve breakfast sandwiches too. Can't wait to try one."
1,Lobster tacos were a nice treat. Service friendly . Simple establishment with nice fresh food. Clean! I checked the chairs and floors. Would easily eat there again.  First impression not good as focus seems to be on alcohol with the big bar and all the booze on display. I was skeptical about ordering food but was pleasantly surprised!
1,"I was told not to review chain restaurants, but this one needs better ratings. \n\nThis place is bomb.  0.45 cent Tuesdays are probably the best.  The pitchers of beers are cheap ($8-14 for domestics).  The wings are the best.  So far I've only had a few on the less spicy scale, but for sure will revisit to kick it up a notch. \n\nOne complaint is that sometimes they charge you for ranch and celery, and sometimes they don't charge.  The wings are consistently good though!"
0,"Hello Kyle, \n\nI would give it 5 stars on fun factor alone!   Servers and Bartenders were super friendly.   Loved the place in general. So why one star????    I wish I could go less, I wish there was a Zero or negative number.  \n\nThe complete and total losers / so called security that works the door!   If you call that working.   \n\nYes we had 35 plus people in our group and rented the Jack Daniels room for the entire night for a birthday party. We are all 30's and 40's professionals, mostly couples, no jerks or obnoxious people in our group. I believe our server would describe us as very polite.   At one point I went to walk two couples out as they had to leave and I just went to say goodby and thanks.   Upon trying to re enter the bouncers said I didn't have a Blue wrist band I explained I had arrived before 7 and there was no cover and we were in the JD room and proceeded to show him my ID.  He replied we are no longer allowing anyone in that has been drinking.   I was not intoxicated in the least and explained my entire group and tab were inside.  He replied he didn't care and I would not allow me to re enter even when I politely offered to pay.    When I asked to see a manager they laughed and said we will get right on that, never moving or getting me one.   Our entire party had to cash out and go to another bar because these assholes wouldn't let me in for no valid reason whatsoever.  \n\nI contemplated going back to see the manager or denying the charge on my CC as I didn't sign it...  When I mentioned this to friends the next day they replied Karma had already has paid them back.  That these are complete and total losers who peaked in high school and are currently working the best jobs they will ever have due to their intelligence level. I thanked them for the very accurate advise and let it go.  \n\nFunny since the incident we met two bartenders that work at TK, who said your not telling us anything we don't know, our security is known for being total assholes.   \n\nSorry cant return...."
1,"Yay! I love Aveda products & love that we have this school.\n\nI have them to thank for leading me to my hairstylist now (Noel - who graduated & is doing big things at a salon locally).  \n\nThe place is clean & prices are super reasonable. The only down side is trying to make an appointment. B/c of the reasonable prices & their hours, they stay booked.\n \nEveryone there is really nice & they aren't pushy about putting extra services or products on you.  However yes, because their teachers are \""grading\"" them, don't expect a quick \""in & out\"" appointment."
1,Great brunch at a reasonable price!! Highly recommend the mussels for a starter!!
0,"My biggest complaint was their pattern department - the patterns (at least many of the drawers I looked in) were in disarray, and they were woefully understocked/out of many, many patterns.  I was very disappointed, I have been thinking about returning to sewing (after being away for 10 years), but I would need to be able to count on being able to get the pattern I want when I go to the fabric store.  Fabric selection was good, but I was super disappointed with the pattern selection (or lack of, as it were)."
0,"I have given this place chance after chance. I don't know why they have the elderly man still making the food. I have nothing against him personally and give him respect for trying, but it's clearly time to retire. The food is HORRIBLE! I order two orders of Egg Foo Young for me and my friend. That was $25 down the drain because neither of us ate more than 1 of the 4 patties it came with! It was the WORST EFY we have both ever eaten. I feel bad because it was my idea to go there!\nI will NEVER give this place my money again!"
1,Is there a cooler place to eat outside?  I'll bet you are hard pressed to find one and the food here is certainly worth the trip!
1,"delish burger...a little slow, but I did request my meat well done.  Otherwise, on point.  :)  If I have the time in the future to go, I will.  It really fills up for lunchtime, so go a bit early."
0,"Food was fine--build your own, but service was terrible. We didn't get silverware (thankfully we found chopsticks up at the grille). No napkins at our booth and they really cheaped out with a single small serving of white rice for the two us. $12.99 each is just simply overpriced for poor service."
0,"Crappy chain resturaunt.. Crappy and annoying. Crappy souvlaki, crappy falafel that always hurts my tummy afterwards. Crappy music they torture me with. I'm amazed this place gets so many positive reviews. It must be from the same people that rate Olive Garden as authentic delicious Italian. Go opa yourself."
0,"Visiting family from California and my Fiance and I decided to visit this dump...big mistake. Slots are tight the patrons that wander this shit hole remind of a Friday night at your typical Pittsburgh area wal mart (stained shirt/sweat-pants/velcro sneakers) since it was mid March and Pnc park wasn't open yet this was on our to do list. If you are from Pittsburgh and have a Gf/Bf you want to show around Pittsburgh don't bring them here!! Exp. If they have been to Vegas before they will look at you like you are crazy and say \"" So this is Pittsburgh?\"" Trust me take them to Penns Brewery or the Carnegie science center before you waste your time and money here"
1,"I have been to Verizon more times than I can count, for all different kinds of shows, in all different kinds of weather. And I can say that, aside from the musical acts stinking it up occasionally, I have never had a bad time and have always left with another unusual story to tell.\n\nOver the years, the parking lot system has been greatly improved, to the point where you really don't wait that long to get out after the show. You used to wait for hours it seemed.\n\nThe best shows I have seen here have been Aerosmith, Steve Miller, James Taylor and, most recently, Journey.\n\nI have always sat on the lawn, and at each one of the shows listed above, a random old couple has handed me a joint. Every time, never fails. I am not a smoker, and I don't think I necessarily look like an obvious pot smoker. For some reason though, a random old hippie couple hands me something to smoke. Never fails.\n\nOf course, like every other major entertainment venue, beer prices are out of this world! That's why we arrive early and tailgate like crazy, so we don't have to buy more than one or two beers inside, if any at all.\n\nIt used to be fairly easy to sneak in an airplane bottle or two, but they have cracked down considerably on that and check people over very thoroughly.\n\nThe sound and acoustics are pretty good, and its easy to hear and see even from way back on the lawn.\n\nThe employees have always been fair and helpful in my experiences."
0,"Ok, it's a Chinese restaurant in a Las Vegas hotel so I was pretty sure it wasn't going to be particularly authentic. Actually check that, there's a Chinese place in the Palace Station hotel that really is quite good. \n\nAnyway, dinner started off well enough when they brought out fried wonton strips and sweet and sour (I'm a sucker for fried wonton skins!). We shared the wonton soup, yang chow fried rice and crispy garlic chicken. The fried rice was really bland and the crispy garlic chicken had an overly sweet sauce that could easily have been orange chicken, general tso's chicken or any other goopy sugar sauce covered chicken. The wonton soup was the best dish of the night with lots of meat, veggies and huge meatball sized wontons.\n\nService was alright, but it seemed like a pretty slow Monday night. Prices are in the $10-$15 range for most dishes, which is not as bad as I was expecting for a hotel restaurant. I'd probably head across the street to PF Chang's before I come back here."
0,"I'm a Las Vegas food and wine writer by trade, so I learned a long time ago to take the good with the bad and focus on writing about the positives of a dining experience while ignoring the variables that can sometimes detract from an otherwise solid establishment. However, I feel that my most recent unpleasant experience at China Poblano requires me to issue a warning to future diners, and that is to STAY AWAY. Seriously, avoid this place and save your money. I used to absolutely love this place, the food was fabulous and unique, the drinks were delicious and creative, and the ambiance was festive and hip. The service has always been aloof and full of bad attitude (Save for a delightful bartender named Steve who was there when they opened but has since moved on to more hospitable pastures.), but I chalk that up to the general attitude of the Cosmopolitan - which generally has the worst service on the strip across the board. Since they opened, I've chosen to overlook that and make this my go to for entertaining clients and out of town guests in a casual setting as it really did have top notch food and a cozy atmosphere. Alas, that is no more. It's been a couple of months since I dined with them, and apparently there has been an overhaul on the menu. The dishes are still tasty, however they have downsized many of them to tapas-like portions while keeping the prices the same (they were once reasonable, now they're typical strip mark-up). This was irritating, but not shun-worthy. That was reserved for the service that has gone from disinterested to disdainful. Our server, Richard, I admit had a sweet personality and an adorable smile - that is for the two minutes when he greeted us and took our order. Once he did that we literally never saw him again until he brought us our check. This was not his fault, he was clearly the only bartender on duty. Why they had him waiting tables as well while the bar was busy was beyond me. My companion and I each ordered salads. Her, the beet and avocado (which was my favorite until now - it's been pared down to a tiny fraction of what it once was.) and I the tuna ceviche (which could have been excellent had it not been drowning in an over abundance of lemon and soy). The pathetic excuse for a beet salad came out a full 10 minutes before my ceviche did. I waited for our server to notice, even attempting to flag him down, but he never bothered to come over. I finally stopped the tall, bald corpse of a manager (you'll know exactly who I mean if you see him) to ask if perhaps I might get my lunch before my companion finished. His response was a dippy 'Well, ya know we have two kitchens so stuff doesn't always come out together, your server should have told you that'. That is the single worst excuse I've ever heard, and frankly, as I learned as a server many years ago it is unacceptable to EVER take out only part of a table's order. Not only was the service terrible but the manager was so annoyed that his diners would dare to ask to receive their food at the same time that he couldn't contain his disdain. I feel just awful that I inconvenienced him so by intruding upon his establishment to order food. I felt that unwelcome. No matter - I will never take another guest there again and I hope to save many a dear Yelp reader from wasting their hard earned dollar on such nasty service and portions of food fit to starve a hamster. I will happily (and very vocally) never ever darken China Poblano's door ever again."
0,"PROS: \n- Good pizza\n- Relaxed atmosphere\n- Off the busy strip\n\nCONS:\n- slow service when more than 3 tables are filled\n- it's SO dark inside\n- miscalculated check DOUBLE CHECK YOUR CHARGES!!\n\nPizza was yummy. I tired a Build Your Own, and the Guinea's. The Guinea's lacked the garlic flavor I was expecting, but the Build Your Own pizza we ordered was delicious thanks to the sauce and dough. The dough is crisp, yet doughy inside. Here are my ratings (1 - 10, 10 being highest) for items i tried:\n\nBuild Your Own: 8\nGuinea's Pizza: 5\nSuicide Fries: 7\nGarlic Fires: 3 (needs garlic!)\nChicken Wing Dip: 7\n\nI was very UNIMPRESSED about the check. Our group ordered a number of items from the menu and many of them were charged incorrectly on the bill. There were items that were $0.25 - $7.50 overchared.  Also, tax was incorrectly calculated as well. The waitress told me that each item price on the check included tax, but this was obviously incorrect since some items on the checked actually matched the menu price, while others were higher than the menu price. \n\nI hope the manager(s) decides to convert to a computerized system."
0,"I agree with you Peter D...that Cold Stone on 24th & Baseline is the nastiest place I've ever been to. The service is poor & the manager is cheap with his ice cream servings. He only puts the ice cream half way full & charges you for every little topping! I have never been to a store where they nickel & dime u too death. I would never go back to that Cold Stone again!!!\n\nOne last comment as I was walking out the store, the bottom of my shoes were sticking to the floor. The floor was just filthy!!! Disgusting"
0,"I am done with Dann'y Car Wash.  Got the VIP wash Friday and when I got in, they had spilled a spray bottle of glass cleaner on my seat, there was armorall all over that had not been wiped in and the dash board looked like it was half done.  This place is a joke"
1,"I initially came across L'Express in United Airlines' Hemispheres magazine, which included the restaurant in its Three Perfect Days in Montreal article. When I saw how well reviewed L'Express was on Yelp, I put it on our \""must\"" list, and am so glad I did. We had a lovely lunch there during a weekend getaway to Montreal.\n\nThe restaurant itself looks straight out of a Parisian brasserie, much to my boyfriend's (a Francophile if ever there was one) delight. The bar is mahogany, the floor is done in black and white tile, and the tables are covered with white tablecloths and paper - just as one would expect to find. We sat at the back of the restaurant where we had a good look at black and white photographs depicting the restaurant and its staff for every year L'Express has been in business, and were quite impressed to see how many employees have remained at the restaurant for 5+ years.\n\nService is slow, but one should expect that - the French do not rush through their meals the way Americans do (which means yes, there should be significant pauses in between courses, and yes, you should have plenty of time to review the menu before being asked to make selections). If you want the waiter, signal - he's not going to hover over your table and pressure you to leave the minute you've finished your plate, thank goodness. \n\nWe did not have a reservation but should have made one - this restaurant is very busy, and if you don't want to wait, I would recommend planning ahead.\n\nWhen it comes to food, I thought L'Express held their own. I started with the courgette soup, which was creamier than I prefer, and I detected what seemed to be bacon crumbles on top, which I could have done without. That being said, it was a delicious soup, and I was more than happy to polish it off with some wonderful fresh bread. My main course, the quail, was absolutely divine. It was accompanied by a beautiful balsamic vinegar over a bed of wild rice. My boyfriend and I shared the tarte au chocolat for dessert, and while it was quite rich, we really enjoyed it.\n\nQuite frankly, I found the L'Express experience to be quite pleasant - it was certainly the most memorable lunch I had in Montreal this October."
1,The decor is amazing. We had a great place to sit and felt very special for the night. We had the 'Amazing Appetizer' and everything tasted great. The portions are big. \nThe chocolate volcano dessert was good but too much just for 2 people after main entree!\nThe price is high but probably you have to pay for the ambience and decor!
0,"My two friends and I tried this place for breakfast one morning.  I have to say it has a nice atmosphere with the open windows and pretty fish tank above the bar.  I liked the look of the place but that was all I was going to get that day.\n\nOnce we were seated it took forever for our very unenthusiastic server to acknowledge us.  Drinks came 10 minutes later.  I cant forget to mention that they served the creamer to our coffee in a gravy boat...HAHA, really?\n\nAll I can say is the food is not worth the wait.  There was nothing wrong with it for us....it just took an hour to actually get to us.  Mind you, the restaurant was half empty.  Not once did the server check on us...he actually disappeared for a bit.  Someone else was nice enough to refill our water and coffee.  \n\nAnd after we sat at an empty table for 20 minutes, asked a bus boy, asked a server, and asked our own server twice did we actually get a check. \n\nNot impressed with this Vegas breakfast at all - room service would have been better..."
1,"have you ever visited Korea or gone to a very traditional Korean restaurant that is run by Koreans with Korean servers?  If you have, you are well aware that their service isn't all about smiles and chatting, but one of diligence and speed.  Some reviewers before me complained about the service being awful, but I assume they aren't used to the way things are run in places like this.  It may not be an excuse, but as long as I get my drink refills and food on time and they pass by and glance at our table to ensure that we are constantly well kept, I don't care if Chung Li smiles at me or not.  If they do their job well, I'm happy.\n\nWith that off my shoulders, let's get to the juicy review!  This is the sister restaurant of Maru in Summerlin, and I have to say that I prefer this place over Maru any day of the year.  We discovered this place on a whim after trying the restaurant below this one (it was horrid). We walked in and there's a faux well in the dining area and everything is clean and well kept.  That's always a good sign.  They seat you or you tell them where you want to be seated, you get the menu and begin the experience.\n\nThey have a variety of traditional Korean dishes, and with the Korean patrons eating there when we first arrived I knew this would be good.  We ordered our typical dishes--bulgogi and kalbi, shrimp tempura appetizer to start.  We asked that they cook it in the back, and they did.  Our tempura was out on our table within five minutes along with the usual side dishes.  I personally love the picked radish and croquette.  Their rokio is good, too, although not the typical white pearl onion version.\n\nOur food arrived promptly, and we waited no more than ten minutes (if that) for the food.  It was good.  I mean really, really good.  When the waitress brought out the salad and then--wait for it.....the radish beef soup,. i wanted to cry.\n\nLet me explain my need for this soup.\n\nWhen I was five years old my parents took me to a Korean BBQ restaurant back home.  They served this awesome clear broth soup with what I assumed was thinly sliced potatoes and maybe a touch or two of beef.  As simple as it sounds, it's a traditional soup appetizer to have with a Korean meal, and I've eaten it every time I had BBQ out at a restaurant.  For two and a half years we searched Korean BBQ places in Las Vegas for this appetizer, and for some reason none of them serve it.  Finally, after 2.5 years of searching, when the girl brought the soup out in its traditional low-rimmed bowl and I had to use the typical long-stemmed spoon to eat it, i teared up.  My childhood wafting in my face with the smells of radish and beef broth.  It was a great moment.  The soup is simple and contains nothing but clear brother flavored by the radish and beef, with thin slices of radish and one or two pieces of shredded beef in the bowl.  It's simply yummy.\n\nAfter eating two bowls of it along with the great BBQ and appetizer, I was stuffed and thoroughly happy. I craved the BBQ daily for a week and satisfied my craving for dinner that week.  I never get sick of bulgogi and kalbi.  \n\nWhen I finally cooked it at our table one night I decided that was the way to go from now on because I could burn my bulgogi a bit more than the cooks in the back would to get that sweeter flavor.  If you ever go to a Korean bbq place, cook it yourself.  It's fun and tasty!\n\nOverall, a great experience, and my only BBQ place where they serve my childhood soup.  I'm looking forward to more of their food again next week, and the week after, and the week after that.  I know that I sing high praises over the soup and the food, but it honestly is that good and is the only spot we will eat Korean food from now on."
0,"I held off on reviewing until I had a chance to try Cento a third time.\n\nFirst, the good:\n\n- The setting is awesome. Might be the best designed restaurant setting in Madison.\n- The drinks are quite good. It's definitely worth checking out the cocktail menu\n- Staff is friendly but not exceptional yet\n\nThe not so good; I've tried a few things off the menu over 3 visits (Bacon dates, gnocchi, beef tartare, burrata, beets, porchetta pizza, bucatini carbonara, pork chop, cauliflower) so I think the following thoughts are pretty accurate. In general, the food doesn't measure up to the ambiance or price.\n\n- Gnocchi was overworked/gummy. They were described as \""pillows\"" and they definitely didn't come out that way. I mentioned this in passing to our waitress when she asked how everything was and I got the impression that she didn't really put much credence in my feedback.  \n- Food was underseasoned across the board. Pizza crust had very little flavor and the bucatini carbonara lacked salt - not sure how that's even possible given the fact that the ingredients include parmigiano and pork cheek (guanciale).\n- Pork chop was overcooked (we wanted to try the beef or lamb but both were sold out when we went )\n\nI really hope the food continues to improve and I'm not ready to give up on Cento yet. I still love the setting and will update this review if my next meal justifies it."
0,"this place sucks! the whole amusement part is great, but the hotel itself stinks!!!! my family asked for a large non smoking room with an indoor hot tub(i know, a lot to ask) and we got a cheap room. our room was smoking optional, two tiny little beds, and the \""hot tub\"" was the BATHTUB!!!! we went to the venetian instead and it was over the top"

1,"Walking out the door with my $8 burger (that's right: no fries, no drink), I had to wonder if my take-out lunch was really a good idea. I'm happy to report, it was one of the best burger decisions I've made. \n\nMost importantly, these mid-sized burgers are the real deal - locally sourced ingredients, cooked to juicy perfection. I topped my beef burger simply, with just guacamole and grilled pineapple. \n\nAs someone with a decent list of food intolerances, their build-your-own burger menu makes ordering nice and easy for me. Choose your toppings wisely, or the price gets a little out of hand - but I see that as a good excuse to come back to try out a few different combinations."
0,"Super weird experience here!!!!\n\nPositives\n-food is cheap \n-$4 burgers\n-$5 shakes\n\nNegatives\n-they sat us down at a table that still had the tip $$ from the pervious customers\n-our burgers took a little long to get to us\n-after about 5 mins of eating I needed a drink refill and my server never came up to check on me\n-I asked a busser that was cleaning a table if I could get another coke\n-a manager from the back came up to the table asking if there was a problem, I politely said everything was good just needed another coke, he said he would get right on it. Five mins later he is still joking around behind the counter and no refill\n-server comes to the table now 10 mins after the manager to check on us. \n\nNeedless to say they did not get a tip. The food is cheap and that's great but customer service could have been a great deal better."
1,Spa tower suites @ Belagio make it the best hotel in town for under a 1000.00 per night.
1,"Great service and great food. I ordered the carne asada and it was cooked to perfection. Although it wasn't a traditional carne asada, since it was just a full steak and not a thinly sliced steak, it was still phenomenal. The service was amazing. I never had to ask for anything as the service was always one step ahead. Props to the bathroom attendant for superior service and a great food recommendation."

1,"I went to Uncle Sals Side Door Corner Store for lunch one Friday, and I loved it.  I was very impressed with the selection of food, as well as the prices.  I had the Italian beef sandwich with some cheese on top.  I have not had a decent Italian beef sandwich since I moved from the Midwest until I went to this place.  If you're looking for Italian beef, this is the place.  Its not a fancy place, rather a hole-in-the-wall location with a very comfortable atmosphere."
1,"Spring training in Phoenix resulted in huge crowds and sky high rental car prices.\n\nEnterprise and its competitors were overwhelmed.  The staff did it's best to keep up.  I used my loyalty card to get to the rental desk without a line, but then still had to wait 10-15 minutes when I went downstairs where the cars are for an agent to show me a car and get the final signatures.\n\nMy standard for top-flight Enterprise service is Atlanta/Hartsfield. If ATL is 5 stars, Phoenix is four.\n\nNote:  All the companies share one facility and use a common shuttle bus.    The rental car return was easy to find. There were loads of signs once you got near the place."
1,"I finally tried bingsoo. I ordered mine with banana, mango and pineapple with mango sauce and frozen yogurt. The frozen yogurt is divine! I wish I would have discovered this when it was 115 degrees outside, but its still good when the weather is a chilly 80 degrees. The shop is a cute little place in a strip mall. It is very clean and inviting. This is a super tasty refreshing treat and I will definitely be back."
1,"A touristy little joint with good food and a crazy fun atmosphere including dollar wallpaper,  saddle bar stools and a saucy bartender.

0,"From the north and looking for a good grocery store?  Stop wasting your time.  There is a grocery store where I grew up in NY called Wegmans and it is continuously voted #1 in the country every year, and not by a hair, it's a long shot.  So, I am not holding Harris Teeter to the same standard, but HT is terrible by any standard.  I don't know if it's the lack of food diversity in the south or HT's fault, but I have a difficult time finding many ingredients I need for cooking at home.  The prices here are higher than those of Wegmans in NY...that's right, higher than the #1 food store in the country in one of the most expensive states in the country.  The prepared foods section at HT is awful.  There are no decent hot meals; terrible taste and variety.  The bakery is no good either.  I have bought 4 different pies and returned them all.  Visit a NY bakery and learn what good is.  Deli?  Forget about it!  \n\nThe standard is far below what it should be here.  I think the corporate QC people of this company need to visit some other high rated grocers around the country to learn where they're lacking.  Food Lion and Bi Lo are crap and pretend to be nothing better.  The annoying part about HT is that they charge out the roof and anyone who has never left Charlotte thinks this is the greatest place on earth.  And one last thing, what the heck is with the check outs?  They're backwards!  You hand your cart to the checkout person, they slowly unload it, the bag dispenser is on the rotating track the groceries are supposed to be on, while you're waiting to pay there is a checkout person 2 feet behind you unloading a cart and bumping into you, and you're left feeling like you just fell into an episode of the twilight zone.  The only thing I dislike about Charlotte (besides terrible drivers) is the lack of quality food and grocers.  I wish a better grocer would merge or buy HT.  Better yet, I wish a better grocer would move to Charlotte and kill HT in market share.  If you follow commercial real estate, you'll notice that HT buys prime locations where competitors make locate, and sits on them.  This is their tactic.  Don't compete in the market on quality, put up barriers to entry.  Scum bags."
0,"GET IT?!?  IT'S A EUPHEMISM!!!!!!  *PINK*. TACO. teeeheeeee BRILLIANT!!\n\nAs subtle as a fart in a rose garden, there lies Pink Taco on Camelback in Scottsdale, the epitome of style (errr... can you call it \""style\""?) over substance.\n\nThe food here is certainly nothing to write home about.   It's all pretty generic, middle-of-the road mass produced tasting Americanized Mexican food with overpriced theme-y drinks. Oh, and guess what?  It's not cheap.  You're paying for the ambiance (which does include attractive waitresses.... hello, if you're reading this).   \n\nAll in all, save your cash or go to Los Sombreros.   No hotties in tank tops, but much better food, unless you like overpriced mehworthy vaginal-themed AmeriMex."
1,"Brought my 2 granddaughters here when they were visiting from the east coast. They were 1 1/2 and 3 1/2. What a great hit! \n\nThe equipment is built so that the parents can go inside as well - a bonus when your little one is trying it for the first time. In addition to the climbing equipment, there are also ride on cars which the toddler loved.\n\nThe equipment is so creative that the kids were entertained for multiple trips during their visit here, and they still talk about wanting to go back on their next visit.\n\nThe staff is amazing at remembering your drink orders - they got mine right on the 2nd visit! And they bring your food and drink to you, so no need to do the \""starbucks dance\"" while you wait (and wait) on the barista.\n\nTheir food is simple but creative and very fresh. My favorite is the breakfast panini. Haven't tried the muffins, as I'm  not a big muffin fan, but the cookies are awesome.\n\nDid I mention super clean? Since it's brand new, everything is sparkling, but you can always see the staff cleaning and cleaning. The owner is very friendly and seems to always be on site, but his crew is very friendly and helpful as well. Just a nice place to hang out and let the kids enjoy."
1,Whenever I need a dose of Hawaii I can always come here and stock up on all the yummy treats I used to enjoy when I lived there.\nI was just there recently for some wine and of course chocolate covered mac nuts. I had to buy a bag of the sea salted ones a well.\nOh..cant walk past the guava jelly without grabbing that as well!\nThese stores are everywhere in Hawaii and I am glad there are a few here.
0,"Well, I was wrong. I admit it. I wanted to love this place, I really did.  Walking in for the appointment I'd made a month before to get my hair done for my college graduation, I discover my stylist (who's also the owner) of Vega, Helia, starting a walk-in client's hair. My appointment was at 1:00 PM and at 1:45, I was still not in the chair. Helia spent 15 minutes playing with the client's baby while I waited.  Graduation was at 6 and I didn't have time to get my nails done too because I had to wait for her to finish the walk-in client.  It was absolutely ridiculous!!  \n\nWhile I was waiting, I noticed dark hair in the brushes she was using that were NOT MINE!! To top if off, there was not one jar of Barbicide in the shop that I could see. \n\nThink I'll be looking elsewhere for a hairstylist."
0,"Why am I am giving this establishment a meager 2 stars? Short story: OK food doesn't make up for bad service. And bad service should never be present at a hawaiian restaurant. Chinese, OK. Hawaiian, no.\n\nLong story:\nMy sister was visiting with her baby and I wanted to take her, the baby, my dad and my brother somewhere near my area for a quick lunch. I found Island Flavor on my Yelp app and liked what I saw. It wasn't very packed when we came in and they had enough room for our small stroller. Immediately noticed our waitress seemed perturbed that we had brought the stroller in. As we sat down, my sister noticed that her child needed a diaper change so she asked the waitress if they had a changing area in their restroom. Nope. But that was ok, not all restaurants have this luxury. So she took her baby back to the car to change her there. She was back in around 10 minutes and as soon as she sat down, our waitress came by and asked if we were ready to order. We look up at her quizzically because I was sure that she saw my sister just sat down. The waitress scowling then adds, \""Are you ready? Yes or no?\"" I chose to ignore her curt behavior at that moment. My sister quickly made a decision and we got our food. \n\nThe portions were very plentiful. My dad and sister's order of kalbi ribs was pretty good. My porkchops however were bland and were not grilled as how I imagined porkchops would be. My brother's chicken barbecue was just OK but not as good as other hawaiian barbecue places. After we all got a drink refill, our surly waitress never came back to check on us. I even had to ask for the check from another waitress who I overheard talking to another customer. I believe she said that the owner was at the cash register and that our sour waitress was apparently the owner's daughter. Well, after what seemed like forever, the entire restaurant is almost empty and no waitress to take our credit card, we all get up and I hand our payment to the cashier/owner. I believe we have been perfectly reasonable customers and the baby didn't even make a big fuss so I'm very perturbed by this place. More unforgivable that an owner shows bad customer service at a hawaiian restaurant. The aloha spirit has left this building, folks."
1,"This is my favorite place to be!!!  other than with my family, of course ;-)\nEveryone there is EXTREMELY nice, welcoming, supportive, and encouraging from the beginners to the advanced WODers.  Mike and Jolene, the owners/coaches, are VERY knowledgable, and know how to keep you safe while pushing you to do your best.\n\nI will NEVER go anywhere else!!!"
1,"When I am having a sugar craving after busting out a gargantuan trail run, I hit this place up. Muffins, cupcakes, all sorts of gluttony inducing items."
1,"Decent selection and clearance pricing can be found at the Brooks Brothers store.  Once you're done shopping and still have some time to kill before catching your flight, you can rest your bottom on one of the dozens of white rocking chairs that line the atrium.  The rocking chairs are a nice perk and you should definitely try to take advantage of them if you can.\n\nThe only complaint I have are with the transport carts.  They are constantly beeping no matter what direction they're going.  I can understand the beeping while in reverse, but it's really annoying when it's constant.  Especially when you have 40 minutes to kill at the gate.\n\nThank goodness for the free WiFi..."
0,"\""Meh. I've experienced better\"" pretty much sums up my experience here tonight.\n \nI have a sneaking suspicion that this is the go-to sushi place for people who either\n A) don't know anything about good sushi or\n B) have no taste buds and money burning a hole in their pocket\n\nI didn't really know what to expect from this place before we arrived. I'd never heard of it before and the only reason we agreed to go was because it was close to my boyfriends house and our friend said it was pretty reasonable in price and quality of food.\nMy boyfriend and I arrived before our friends and we walked to in an almost completely deserted restaurant. There was some really bad techno remixes of popular songs playing in the background and an episode of Dr. Phil on the television. I sat down in one of their ridiculously tall bar chairs while my boyfriend went to grab us a menu we could look over while waiting for our friends to arrive. \nMost. Uncomfortable. Chairs. Ever! \nI couldn't have been sitting in it longer than a couple of mins before I had to get up out of it. The seat had an aluminum bar or something all the way around it that dug into my leg after sitting down. It's hard to describe how or why they were so uncomfortable, but if you've been here before you know what I mean. They clearly chose these chairs based on aesthetics alone. \nAnyway, our friends arrived and we all ordered our food. I decided on getting the ultimate salmon roll and I believe it was called the sun roll. I could be wrong on the name of that second one but it was something close to that. My boyfriend got a couple rolls and we decided to share a plate of tuna sashimi. For the 2 rolls I ordered and the plate of sashimi it was almost $40. My boyfriend got the sunshine roll and a las vegas roll. Those two rolls plus a drink was more than $20. So all together we spent more than $60. I love sushi. I would be more than happy to pay those prices for a plate of delicious fish. But what came out was not what I was expecting for the price we paid. \nMy rolls were pretty, but they were almost inedible. I pretty much choked down the ultimate sushi roll. 2 or 3 pieces into eating it I debated wether or not it was worth finishing. The little tiny bit of smoked salmon that was inside was dry and I could barely taste the fresh salmon that was conservatively layered on top. I moved onto the whatever-sun roll and that was a little bit better but it was still lacking in flavor and texture. The sashimi was just awful. It didn't taste like fish, it almost didn't taste like anything, and the texture of it was really weird. It was almost chewy. My boyfriend and I have been known to just down entire plates of sashimi in less than a min or two, but after one piece he called it quits and it took me the entire rest of our time in the restaurant to finish the plate.\nThe staff was pretty nice, I mean they weren't going out of their way to be pleasant with us but they weren't rude either. \nAll together I'd say this visit and the food was a total failure. I feel like this place's only saving grace is that it's clean and it's in a pretty convenient location. I would have liked to give this place another shot and try another couple of rolls before writing my review, but I was REALLY disappointed with the \""food\"" (I am having a hard time even using that word because it was barely edible) I ordered. It wasn't the worst sushi in the world, but it wasn't anywhere near the best. And with the prices they're charging for these lack-luster rolls, I really don't see myself ever coming back here again."
0,"The last few times we have been to Vegas, we have come here. The food is just not that great. We've tried the gumbo, rib eye, and the pork chops. For the price...it's just not worth it.... The service? Not great either!!? Our servers have not been very attentive.\n\nEven though I like the atmosphere... we won't be going back to Emeril's."
1,"I used Vegas Atmosphere for a close friends divorce party. Being a female, I wasn't sure about how to throw a fun weekend for a guy and this seemed like a fun option. Sam provided models that were fun and got the party started. My friend had a blast at Drais pool / beach club and had no idea all the beautiful girls entertaining him were professional atmosphere models ! \nThis is a great service if your looking to have a Vegas party weekend or celebration . What's nice too is that the models weren't sleazy or trashy . I had a great time with them ."
0,"Shame on the organizers of the Expo!  They advertised $25 admission at the door on their website.  When we arrived, they were charging $35 per person, which we still would have paid.  HOWEVER, we had our two young children with us (ages 2 and 4) and they insisted that we would have to pay $35 PER CHILD as well.  They even were charging full admission price for infants in baby carriers!   SHAME ON YOU, JOE WEIDER and anyone else who has a hand in FALSE ADVERTISING and price gouging.  There is absolutely no justification for charging for infants and toddlers admission to this event.  It is not as if they are taking up extra seating at an expo and they certainly cannot use or enjoy any of the nutrition product samples.  Guess what?  I am reporting these fraudsters to the FTC, Better Business Bureau and Nevada State Attorney General.  We walked away on principle, so they lost out on our money.  I hope that other parents who wanted to attend this farce did the same."
1,Excellent service. They were very busy so the food was slow but they kept our mouths entertained with free bread and appetizers. Of course it is pricey but it is worth it. Food was excellent.
0,"I will not visit your location again.  You do not honor your coupons.  There were two times I gave the register worker a coupon and they were not applied to a drive thru order.  Both times valid coupons were used, and one instance was greeted with negativity and the response that I did not need to use a coupon.  The price on the menu does not include the coupon.  I will not bring my money to your establishment if you do not honor your own advertising."
1,"Everything was yummy. Service took a little long, but they kept the coffee mugs filled. Had the veggie omelette and some pancakes...they were SO good, as were the has browns. Turkey link sausage was so so, but everything else was yummy!"
1,"Perfect place.  Designed to a T.  Edgy and classy. Service is excellent.  Drinks are tasty.  Food is creative and delish.  Coffee is the best- but beware is espresso.  Patio seating outside gives you a view of the strip and a birds eye view of the used to be Piratte show.  The short ribs, Trout, and sashimi taster are great dishes.  Thiswas one of my more memorable nights ever and thanks to Social House for the start of this evening."
0,Went here just before a movie. The service was fast but that's it. I ordered the mango and shrimp quesadilla. My friend ordered nachos. The food was not good. I and my friend could not finish our food and we had stomach aches immediately after.
1,"Excellent Sushi! Great quality fish, especially on the weekends. I like the atmosphere, and the Sushi chef's are very friendly and skilled."
1,"We were told about this place before visiting Scottsdale and decided to go.  We were not disappointed.  The margaritas were terrific (a great selection), and the food was equally good.  It is one of the best restaurants I've been to."
1,"Two years is a long time... \n\nI had the FTR for this restaurant over two years ago.  It was the worst review I've ever written for any business.  If you'd asked me two years ago to return to The Estate House, there was no way I'd say yes.\n\nBut in two years, this place has really come a long way... I believe the three star bump I'm giving to my original review is thanks to Zoran, the GM, Chef Gio Osso, and a crew of friendly and attentive staff.  \n\nThe Estate House is still as beautiful as I remember it being in February 2008, but it's perhaps even more beautiful now that they've got the ambiance, cuisine, and service to go with the physical beauty.\n\nMy evening kicked off with a little mixer on the outdoor third floor patio.  Service was fantastic and drinks were strong.  I corresponded with guests at the mixer, but also with many of the Estate House staff.  From there, I went downstairs for a lovely dinner with my husband.  While the menu is still on the fancy side for me, I was pleased with everything from the appetizers to the dessert.  \n\nWe ordered the Burrata and Scallop appetizers, and were served way too much fresh bread to start as well... Turns out they were out of Burrata but replaced it with the smoothest, creamiest, largest pillow of Mozzarella I've ever had.  We cleaned both plates.  Jared went with the Moroccan Seven Spice Grilled Lamb entree and I chose the Honey Saba Lacquered Black Cod.  Both were unique preparations with a ton of flavor.  I could've done without the candied pancetta on the cod, but that didn't stop me from eating way too much.  In addition, we had grilled asparagus and sauteed spinach... (the greens balance out everything else, right?!)\n\nWe were stuffed but were joined by a couple of friends for dessert and shared the bread pudding and a chocolate peanut butter special... both were fabulous.  All of this while enjoying a bottle of wine.\n\nNeedless to say, I am extremely happy I gave The Estate House another shot.  They've come a long way in two years, and I anticipate returning again soon.  I encourage you to do the same.\n\n**They are now open for lunch (which I must say looks very reasonable), and they have all kinds of special events including Cooking Classes, Easter Brunch, Simple Sunday Dinners, etc..."
0,"Horrible, horrible, horrible!!! I took my Dad and his wife that were visiting from out of town and I felt so bad that the food was so tasteless. The waiter was super rude and slow. Then my Dad went to pay for the bill and he didn't realize until later that he had given them an expired credit card so the manager came over and was almost yelling at us saying the card was declined in her loudest voice saying she tried 3 times. Then my Dad paid with another card and we left to be chased down by the rude ass waiter saying my Dad didn't sign the bill when in actuality he did but the manager had taken the bill before the waiter seen it. We were all horrifies and humiliated the way we were ALL treated! So very disappointed. Never in all my life was I treated like a thief. I will never be back to this place again."
1,"I could not have been more satisfied with the staff! At 22 i was shocked that they would have even scheduled me for an appointment here. But they did and I had my tonsils removed everyone I came into contact with was amazing! They truly cared to make me as comfortable as possible, they truly seemed to enjoy there jobs. Everyone has off days which one nurse I believe was but it was also 6am.  But she was still nice just different.. My aftercare nurse made sure i was comfortable and not in pain. She was so helpful and truly made my experience the best it could have been. I wish I knew her name but from the pain meds and half asleep I dont have a clue! But I would recommend this hospital to any one who has to take there child here. I know when i have my children it will be the first and only place i go!"
1,"Here we go you guys:\nGreat food. Had the shredded beef chimichanga (pronounced Chimmy-CHANG-ga). Sarie had the pork carnitas (pronounced Car-knit-tuhs). Good. Good. Real good.\nStarted out with two-for-one Mojitos. They were as refreshing as skinny dipping in the fountain of youth. \nWe went with a groupon of course, so we also had two house margaritas. I had mine frozen (like my heart). Sarie had hers on the rocks (like our marriage). All good.\nThis place gets crankin around 8 pm. So plan on a busy, eventful, loud experience. Which is exactly what we wanted. There was a birthday girl at the booth next to us. She was very pretty.They did the song and dance for her. \nAlso, the little mariachi man with the guitar can break down one hell of a 'De Colores' if you're interested in that stuff. I am of course.\nSkipped out on desserts. who can eat a flan after all that booze and chips and rice and beans? \nThe BEAR can, that's who! That's why next time I'm rocking CDJ with the big Bear and we'll go all the way with that caramel custard you guys."
1,We needed something quick to eat before the cinema & so we thought we'd give this a try.\nThe service was efficient & the food was really tasty. I had the chicken dhansak and it was one of the best I've had in ages. If you're in the area it is worth checking out.
1,"we went family style and ordered 4 different pizzas and shared them all.  They were all good.  I was fortunate that we were done with patients early so when i got there, there was hardly any wait.  Everyone enjoyed them, but from my other experiences I know you can wait up to 3 hours to get in.  Its got a great decor but is small, and this often means you end up waiting a while.  I do not think it is worth anything more than a half hour wait but it is good.  All the pizzas are good!"
0,"Visited today for lunch.  This is the second week they are hosting lunch so I was a bit wary.  I called ahead at 10:45 and asked how the wait has been for lunch and was told there were no waits.  We showed up at 11:15 and were told there was a 35 minute wait!  Ugh!  Needless to say, we went elsewhere.\n\nI've visited before for dinner in the summer (no wait) and had a good experience but I feel like Bianco's  has been over-glorified so much that my expectations are just way too high to give it anything but 3 stars - and after our lunch fiasco today, they dropped to a 2-star restaurant in my book."
1,"Pricey, but worth it for a special occasion. We have purchased multiple Groupons and never been disappointed with Hobe. Great service, and awesome product. The steak tastes like what you would get at a top of the line steakhouse, only you don't have to tip. \nWe've gone for the $5 lunches and those are awesome too."
1,"Papa Murphy's back on the west side! I missed this place when the one on Flamingo and Jones closed years ago. We ate it every two weeks. New store:\n\nPizza: Awesome as usual. Their large pie is larger than most other joints, around $10, Family size is $2 more. Dough is very good and when you bake it at home, you can control how crisp the bottom is. They are not skimpy on toppings either. The baking tray it comes on is super. By making it at home, your pie is hot out of the oven, not lukewarm and soggy like delivery pie. The pizza will bake perfectly.\n\nStaff: Very friendly and helpful.\n\nValue: All things considered, size of pie, fresh ingredients, large topping selection, great dough, bake it hot at home, it is worth every penny! This is not like Cici's or Little Caesars, much better.\n\nGive it a shot and I think you will be happy."
0,"My boyfriend and I are visiting from San Diego and were looking for a good happy hour.  The two-for-ones brought us to this place.  The vibe seemed pretty good, the music was pretty good but the people watching was actually the best.  The bartender staff were pretty wild and seemed to be having a great time.  There was also a speed dating event going on - pretty \""40 year old virgin\"" ish.  \n\nThis is an interesting crowd as there were a number of guys with shaved heads - is that an Arizona thing or is it symbolic of something else?   The crowd demographics are either young or old and not much in between.  \n\nThe appetizer food that looked good on line sucked!  Although cheap, you got what you paid for.  We had crab cakes, chicken wings, calamari rings and french fries.  French fries were way over cooked and too brown; calamari was chewy; and the chicken wings were fried too long.  \n\nIf you want cheap entertainment, go there but don't expect good drinks or food - just good, old fashioned people watching!"
1,"M & M was the highlight of our recent vegas vacation.  we used to live west of this place, and musta past it a billion times, never noticing it.   in any case, we wished we'd visited it sooner.  the waffles and pancakes were TO DIE FOR.  seriously...all three of us in our party agreed that they were the best we'd ever had.  and the potatoes...don't get me started, THE best potatoes I'd ever had...seriously now...amazing food.  we couldn't believe our taste buds.  but the food alone did not make this place 5 stars....the staff also made it 5 stars.  our waitress was ULTRA friendly.  The host was always refilling our drinks.  amazing attentiveness and service.  bravo.  i would suggest coming here morning, noon, and night if you live in the area, if not the entire vegas metro...its worth the drive...and don't be scared by the exterior...because the interior is the best you're gonna get.  seriously now...amazing service and food.  and the prices were DIRT cheap...incredible!"
1,One of the coolest places I would've never expected to find in Uptown Charlotte. Feel like I stepped off Church St. and into a little corner of the Emerald Isle. Definitely worth a visit. Grab an irish pint in this cozy pub and enjoy some good darts or soccer on the tv.
0,Very disappointed.\n Have bought a bunch of stuff there  to help the local shop out- then went in to have one old photo scanned. I did not have a thumb drive with me at the time and she said I can do it now and put it on a disk. Went to pay for it and it was $4.99  (99 cents for the scanning $4.00 for the disc) REALLY?  \nShe did not tell me it was that much before she did it - \nI am about to buy a Cannon 70D and guess where I will not buy it?\n\nHello big box store - there is a reason why the small guys are going out of business!
0,"First off, this place reeks of urine! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. it was disgusting! The bread was soaked in grease, you couldn't pick it up like a sandwich even if you wanted! The pork meat was very mushy and not pleasant tasting at all!"
1,"I've shopped this location through the last few renditions, (ABCO, Sun Market) and now Asiana Market.  They've really cleaned it up over the last year and it's a solid place to go for a variety of import foods from the Orient, Middle East, and the Mediterranian.  Produce is incredibly inexpensive with hard-to-find items."
1,"Their coffee is delicious, however generally sweeter than Starbucks and more reasonably priced. The staff is always chipper and pleasant. I definitely recommend! They get stickers every month so ask the cashier!"
0,"As one of the other reviews said, there were flies all over the pizza and the place wasn't clean at all.  The pizza was reheated and was barely warm when they gave it to me.  I've eaten NY style pizza and while the style was close, the pizza was a definite F.  My coworker had the calzone and said the sauce was good.  Definitely a disappointment looking for good thin crust pizza in Phoenix."
1,"I took my 5 year old daughter and my father in law there during the swine flu season.  The place was empty and we got free upgrades.  The show was amazing.  The sets blew me a way and this was nothing like Mystere, the other Cirque de Solei show we saw.  There is always room for improvement but I think the set design and the amazing choreography are worth the $."
1,Read good reviews about the place on yelp and it didn't disappoint me or my wife. The service is very welcoming and the food tasted equally better. Would definitely  recommend this place to all my friends.
1,"While in Vegas with family someone suggested we go out for sushi. Now, you have to realize that my experience with sushi has been terrible at best. Tried it at a few local places and didn't care for it but hey, we were in Vegas and we wanted to try some new things. Am I glad we did. I guess one big factor in the sushi experience is a) the preparation and b) the freshness of the ingredients. Well, they have these two down pat at Shibuya. \n\nFrom the moment we walked in and sat down we felt relaxed and comfortable. I tried the yellowfin sashimi which was out of this world. Then, I stuck with my tried and true spicy tuna with soy wrap roll which were also just incredible (so simple, yet so delicious). Just a dab of soy sauce and I was in heaven. After that, I tried something I never thought I would eat in my life....eel. Ewww....eeeeel. Seriously? Well, great googily moogliy, it was divine. Do yourself a favor, leave your inhibitions at the door and give it a try. Oh man you'll be glad you did. \n\nCouple that with some sake (can't remember what kind it was but it really complimented the meal) and the simplicity of the peel your own soy pods and you have just one perfect meal. Definitely try this place out if you are in Vegas. You won't be disappointed."
1,Sandwiches are good.  They have messed up my order multiple times. They offer to bring me a new one but I opt for the free sandwich on my next order. I have a limted lunch hour and do not have the extra time for them to remake and deliver me another sandwich.
0,"OUR WEDDING NIGHT-MARE !!! 01/23/2013\nOur rating for this business is a ZERO. (0)  \nThey are unprepared, unprofessional and misleading with false promise and lies.\nTHE OWNER Minister Melinda Rosenberg did not know how to operate the music boom box. So we got no music for the wedding. She even asked my wife to help her figure it out. Only then did my wife and I get to dance to a wedding song. (Thanks Baby)\nThe owner pushed Christianity on us and MADE us recite the prayer to give our lives to Christ at the alter without discussing any of our faith practices. THIS SO WRONG!! \nShe did not know how to work the computer to copy pictures to the CD.  After getting home we discovered she copied 25 pictures of another two weddings on our cd, so we got no pictures.  When we called to get the photos sent to us, we were told that they may have lost them or erased them!  She will call me with an answer.. We are Still waiting for an answer.!!  She made up stories about some other clients getting our pictures and needed to bring them back.  The photos are in her computer.. I hope !  \nShe said she was going to go to the court house as a bonus to record our marriage so we could have an original before we left Vegas.  Guess what?  She did not do this.  We wasted gas and time from our honeymoon for nothing.  Left empty handed.\nAfter contacting Melinda about the photos and the marriage license recording, she lied about the license being recorded in one day.  The license bureau said it can take up to three days or more because they process 100's every day. \nShe knows nothing about computers, obviously, and just makes up stories to ignore the truth. \nThis was, all in all, the worst decision we could have made. If I could go back knowing what I know now, I would pay triple to have someone else marry us that is professional.\nI even gave Melinda a $50.00 donation and tipped the guy at the court house who brought us to Melinda $20.00. Prior to today, the 01/27/2014. If I could, I would take it all back..\nMelinda never even offer to refund anything for our inconvenience, How sad! Very Bad Business..\n *** We are reporting her to the secretary of state and the marriage bureau.\nThe end results are the best thing .. I am married to the most amazing woman in the world and for that I thank god..( I think I am married? )  I hope!\nJoseph and Dawn N.\nSan Diego\n01-27-14"
0,"This is actually no longer the Wyndham, it is a Renaissance now. While the hotel looks nice and the rooms are modernly decorated, the walls are PAPER THIN. I always expect a little bit of noise staying in a hotel, but when the person in the next room is talking at a normal volume at 2am, I shouldn't wake up thinking there is a person in my room. Every word said in the neighboring rooms could be heard, including the \""you look sexy in red...\"" conversation. Even though I have no complaints about the other aspects of my stay, I wouldn't stay here again. \n\nAlso, Wi-fi is $13 a day."
0,"The rating is based solely on the grooming service, the store itself is very cute and the sales people were always very professional. My boyfriend and I just moved to old town Scottsdale and we were searching for a pet groomer.  I stopped by the store on a whim and found the cutest collar for our girl Scottie so I figured why not try their grooming services for both our Scottish Terriers? \nThe first time, we called and brought them in on the same day, we were told our groomer would be Susan.  We were very pleased that they were willing to squeeze us in at the last minute.  We explained what we wanted and were told to come back in a few hours. However, when we picked them up Susan was nowhere to be found.  The cut looked good so we just left the tip with one of the girls at counter and got in the car.  Once, we got home we noticed some blood on our wheaten Scottie's neck.  When we looked a little closer, we realized he had a deep cut on his neck from the groomers. It took about 2 weeks to fully heal but we figured he probably jerked his head when she was trying to groom his face.  I just found it odd that no one mentioned this to us when we picked them up.  It was a pretty bad cut and there is no way she wouldn't have noticed it when it happened.   \nBut we figured mistakes happen, and they are so convenient to where we live that we would give them another try.  Similar the Steph R's experience, we made our appointment a week before for 8 am on a Saturday.  We arrived at 8:05 am and Susan was nowhere to be found.  There was a Hispanic man inside the store, that didn't speak a word of English but motioned for us to come in and he took their leashes.  We felt very uneasy and decided to go grab a bagel and come right back to check up on our pups.  We came back at 9 am and Susan was there.  The Hispanic man was washing our dogs and Susan just seemed to be standing around.  We explained that we felt uncomfortable with the situation and had come back to check on our pups.  She assured us they were in good hands.  We explained what we wanted, and asked when them would be ready.  She said 1 pm and that she would call as soon as they were done.  1 pm rolled around and no call, at 1:45 pm, my boyfriend called wondering if they were ready.  The groomer said that they were and to come get them.  Once, he brought them home, we immediately realized that she hadn't cut their skirts at all even though, we had specifically asked that she cut their skirts very short.  Also, she had cut one side of my girl Scottie's eyelashes but not the other side.  \nNeedless to say, we will not be returning for a third visit.  I think Susan is a nice woman and means well but a manager needs to look the job she is doing and work on her customer service skills.  I very much hope that this review, will help the store improve their grooming services."
1,"Oh, yum yum yum yum yum. What could be better than a sweet, lightly crunchy cinnamon crunch bagel with freshly made hazelnut cream cheese and a fresh, steaming cup of coffee to start your morning? Or a freshly grilled turkey, bacon, cheddar, and sun dried tomato sandwich for lunch, with a Jone's soda to wash it down?\n\nI love Panera Bread (or as I call it, \""Pantera Bread,\"" 'cuz I'm so hardcore like that) so much. It's clean, comfy, it smells like coffee, and the food is the best. Sometimes, at lunch and dinner, there can be quite a line, but it's always worth it if you have the time to stick around. Oh, and if you need bread, their Country Loaf is always a good choice."
1,"My favorite things about symphony hall is how much culture to which it is actually a performance home. The ballet, the opera, the symphony, and more. \n\nYou need not look further than symphony hall if you are in search of something to bring some depth and beauty into your every day life. If you have a student ID you can get tickets to performances for $10 immediately before the start of any performance. You fill a seat basically. You may have great seats. You may have not so great seats. The point is that you get out and get some culture in your youth at a very low price. Fill your life with beauty and culture. You will always find something worth while filling the space at symphony hall."
0,"This is my #1 biggest concern. About half way through the HOF, I realized it was lunch and decided to head over to the cafeteria. As with places like this, I expected the food to be overpriced, but was not expecting to get totally ripped off. A veggie wrap for $4.50 seemed like the best deal on the menu (and at least they do have a vegetarian option!) and perhaps it was, but it was much smaller than I expected. And since everything is made in the morning and already wrapped you cannot tell them \""no onions\"" for instance. Food allergies will come into play a lot here I'm sure as you have to get the food the way it's made. My husband chose to get a \""side salad\"" and we laughed when we realized a side salad is not a smaller salad, but a small portion of macaroni salad or tomato and cheese salad. We were both hungry when we left. We did not buy chips or candy, but you can get a small bag of chips for $1.00 or a regular sized candy bar for $2.00 If you're thirsty, you're in luck because they have soda, water, and juices, but they are the smallest bottles I've ever seen for $2.00 (that was for the soda - juices may be more). This is to encourage people to buy more I'm sure and to avoid sharing. They could easily sell them for $1.00 a piece and still make a killing, but they are more interested in being greedy.\n\nWhen you enter the museum and when you leave the cafeteria area, you will see signs saying no outside food or drink and no food or drink outside of the cafe. I'm almost certain this is not to keep the exhibits safe, as mostly everything is behind glass, but a ploy to get you to spend more. By the time you're half way through you'll be so thirsty, that you'll have to buy an overpriced drink, and then you'll see the sign saying you have to drink it all in the cafeteria area. There may have been water fountains by the bathrooms, but I doubt it. So my #1 suggestion is to eat before you go and tuck a drink in your purse for later.\n\nSecond problem is their photos. When you enter, they take your picture as though you're about to set sail on a cruise and then they charge you just as much for it. When you go to the photo area, you'll see a large flat screen TV behind the counter and will probably assume, as we did, that this is to display your picture so you can decide before they print it out if you want it or not. Not so. This is merely to advertise that that is where you get your pictures, and they have slide shows of previous visitors up there. They instead print out every single picture and presumably toss the ones that do not get bought. I asked them to please not print out our photo as I doubted we'd pay the $20 for it and I didn't want to waste the paper or ink, and I was met with an attitude by the girl behind the counter. She said they print out everyone's photo - as if that makes a difference. That makes the problem worse! I would just expect such a museum to take more interest in protecting our resources. I'm sure they find that people are more likely to buy the photos if they are in front of them, but again, they are just being greedy.\n\nAside from that, I found the history on the tracks very interesting and I love seeing the different grade percentages for the tracks. They have a 33 degree grade that you can step on - very similar to one that exists if you visit the Daytona track. The history on the cars I found to be very boring.\n\nThe hard card activities were more hassle than they were worth as you wait in line to try each one and then some of the machines didn't even work.\n\nYou can get parking diagonally across the street for $5, which I thought was the best value all day! Admission prices are not too pricey either, I didn't think.\n\nOh, and the simulator ride costs extra.\n\nExcept for the attitude we got from the photo girl, everyone else was very nice. But this is really something you visit only once. I can't imagine we'll ever go back.\n\nAll in all, I doubt I'd recommend the Nascar Hall of Fame - for me there is very little I took away from it."
0,"Very, very over rated!  The only thing that stands out is the service.  If you are the person that raves about a market sandwich from Pane Bianco this is not for you.  Very simple and very average ingredients. My mom has been making sandwiches like this for me my entire life. I think I was expecting similar flair like the sandwiches from Culinary Dropout. \n\nFood Guy Out!"
0,"I think this place is really more of a 2.5, depending on your gown style preferences. But here's the general lowdown:\n\nStaff- The women who work in this shop are very pleasant and helpful.\n\nStore- The store itself is tiny and cramped. Not a good place for claustrophobic brides unless you have a brown paper bag handy.\n\nInventory - Many of the dresses are quite dated (if you're having an 80's throwback themed wedding, you'll definitely find a suitable dress here), but a few had some promise. Another engaged friend and I had been checking out the Maggie Sottero dresses and the sales clerk eagerly offered to order any dress from the stack of vendor catalogs she had piled on the cash wrap. She also seemed willing to work with pricing, so at least for any \""Maggie Brides\"" out there, if you see a Maggie Sottero gown somewhere else (and Adeline doesn't carry a sample of the one you fell in love with) it might be worth checking with them on pricing and order/ delivery time frames.\n\nPrices - Most of the dresses fell between the $800 - $1800 price point."
1,"The place is wonderful. The workers have a nice additude and always care. The auditoriums are big and the seats are extremely comfortable. A little more expensive then regular theatres, but WAY worth it."
0,Well put sarah... but if you want a super quick place for lunch they get you in and out... the food is to be expected... burrtios from a chain resturant...
1,After watching the most amazing sunset at South Mountain Summit I headed back to Scottsdale and stopped here for dinner. Sat at the bar and had a ice cold beer served in an ice cold glass. The butternut and white cheese enchiladas were absolutely amazing and the cucumber salad that accompanies it was very refreshing. Vanessa the bartender was very attentive. It was a perfect end to a perfect evening!!
1,"I was given a second chance to try CHoP in Chandler and last nights experience was completely different than my first. \n\nLet's start with the staff, last night (a week day evening so the restaurant was busy but not overly crowded) they all were on their game. Our glasses were constantly being refilled, plates were taken away at the appropriate times and the table was checked on often to make sure things were coming out to our liking. \n\nAppetizer: Downtown Fries ($9) - the fries were cooked well, not soggy or overdone. They were seasoned properly and the spicy aioli that come with the fries was great. \n\nEntree: Barbecue Baby Back Ribs ($24) - it has been a while since I have had good ribs. These were fall off the bone delicious! The barbecue sauce was sweet and had a little bit, the meat was tender and not fatty like some ribs can be. I would order these again and recommend them too! \n\nDessert: Pecan Torte ($7) - the pecans were crispy and the combo with the vanilla ice cream and the butterscotch sauce tied this little dessert together. A tasty little dessert to share as it is rich. \n\nEverything I had last night was on par, the service was up to snuff like a steakhouse should be. Bravo to the staff, chef's and management who made last night a lovely dinning experience."
0,"I have been here many, many, many times and they seriously never have ANYTHING in stock! It's getting annoying and old! This one and the one on Camelback are always sold out of their popular products (Anastasia Beverly Hills, Too Faced, etc). HOW ANNOYING!!! Get your ish together Ulta!!!!! It's a waste of my drive and time to come to your store! UGH!"
0,"Before new management took over this place the old management was absolutley amazing. They came out with this coupon book which included a 50% off sushi!!! Went a couple weeks later and there was new management. I went to use my coupong (after already ordering) and they would not accept it. Their reasoning was because it is \""new management\"". I only had enough for what the price would be with 50% off and I asked to speak to manager and he was extremely rude and nasty. My roomate ordered sweet tea and never recieved it, and also the food has completely gone down hill. the \""sauce\"" that was supposed tocome with my roomate's meal was like water when it was supposed to be cream based. \n\n\nTerrible Experince I will never go back unless management changes."
0,"It wasn't for me. I generally like middle eastern food.  I got the sampler to go ; babaganesh, falafel, taheni, humus with pita. Everything was very bland. The pita and falafel were chewy. I ended up throwing most of it out."

0,"Short story:  AVOID\n\nLong story: Went in, filled up with $80+ in gasoline.  Had a fussy baby I was managing and also due to waiting in line for an excessive amount of time found myself needing to use the restroom.   A youngish girl with no customer service skills read me the riot act about needing to stay with my car until I could pull it forward to the vacuum station, then I would be allowed to go inside to pay.  \n\nAnyways, it is that type of cold, careless, mean-spirited behavior that drives customers away.  It sure did for me.  NEVER GOING BACK.  \n\nSo how did it work out?  I walked inside to the bathroom, and they magically found a way to move my car ten feet forward to the next position before driving it through the wash.  As far as the mean little girl with attitude?  I do not really know, but I suspect living in a trailer park is in her future."
1,This is the place to go late night eats....and a nice place vs a hole in the wall. Try the truffle blue cheese chips....mmmm yummy. The crab cakes I thought were ok....\nNow the pizza is surprisingly good....get any of the choices.
1,"First of all my review is strictly on the item advertised to even get me to go to this place...\n\n$1 BURGER AND FRIES FROM (If I can recall) 12AM-6AM. They have several advertisements outside the Flamingo and inside as well.\n\nThis is located in the Flamingo, just walk around and you can't miss it.\n\nPlace looks modern and clean. I was expecting a beat up musky run down joint, but it did not feel like that at all.\n\n**YOU CANNOT ORDER THE $1 BURGER AND FRIES TOGO** --I tried\n\nSo how was it? Cheese is not included, it's an extra $.75.\n\nFries were plenty full, its the big wedge types (but not potato wedges). The burger wasn't big, but it wasn't small either. It's filling. It didn't have much flavor, even with the cheese, so I can only imagine without.\nAll in all it was satisfying and you can't complain on the price.\n\nService was good, and it looks like if we actually got the items on the menu it would have been better. \n\nFor a cheap late night meal where you can sit down and people watch, I would recommend this place."
0,"Went here as a recommendation.  I don't think we'll go back because there didn't seem to be anything that really stuck out as amazing.  The place was extremely loud and what they said would be a 20 minute wait was actually a 35 minute one.\n\nThe wings however were good, the only negative thing about the wings was how much feathers were left on them.  We literally were picking off the feathers.  Eeek.  \n\nMajority of us were eating wings. The wings were good, the only negative thing about the wings was how much feathers were left on them.  We literally were picking off the feathers.   Gross.\n\n\nI decided to opt for a couple little appetizers.  I love this idea.  Priced at $3.50 were chips and dip.  Homemade potato chips topped with bacon, bleu cheese and served with a green onion dip.  They serve good quality bleu cheese, the bacon was a plentiful... BUT, the chips didn't seem all that fresh.  The second appetizer was the $3.95 pretzel dough bites stuffed with cheese and served with marinara. 4 in an order.  I got them and thought, were is the pretzel?  It was glorifed little ceasers stuffed cheese bread.  We couldn't even get through one.   \nThe kids meals are priced at $5.95, comes with a drink.  We purchased 4 soft drinks for the young ones.  Two root beers, 1 sprite, 1 Dr. Pepper.   She brought us 4 large glasses with no lids, all ROOT Beers.  Im pretty sure she just failed waitressing 101.\n\nThe kids meals arrived.  #1 ordered the two cheeseburger sliders.  They looked alright.  #2 ordered Mac & Cheese, the menu didn't inform us it would be KRAFT.  \nAs much as we love the old' Blue Box Mackers.  Restuarants should not serve it!  It's really should be outlawed at restaurants.  Most of us that know how to cook know how to make a pasta and cheese sauce from scratch.  Easy breezy in a restaurant, right?  \n\nWe placed our orders and my sister ordered a burger with the cheese sauce on the side.  They brought the burger out WITH sauce on it.  The waitress offered to replace it but we were on short time with a movie to catch which we told her.  There was no other compensation beside that.  \n\nThe water glasses were always on empty with refills hard to come by.  Eating hot wings.  No water.  BRILLIANT.\n\nWith that all being said, they tacked on a 20% gratuity charge.  Not sure she deserved that much.  \n\nI won't bother going back.  The food is lackluster and the service is even worse."
0,"I am a Starbucks lover through and through, but this location can never seem to make my coffee correctly, such as making a mocha instead of white mocha when it was repeated back correctly. And then it is corrected it is so over syrupy that it's almost  undrinkable. I will not be going to this location anymore."
1,"Woohoo finally I got to try this place! Loved my cheese burger. Had a BOGO coupon for and entree or sandwich my boyfriend and I shared it. We got two cheese burgers, one basket of onion rings (not the best) and drinks. Overall my experience was great. I look forward to going back here"
1,"Of course this place gets all stars from me.\n\nLemongrass chicken is probably my idea of Grand Master Flash Heaven. Speaking of Heaven, also try the Seventh Heaven Salad rolls thingies.\n\nService is slow but by the time I think about it I'm too busy concentrating on the infomercial/yoga session video of the Supreme Goddess Master on the big screen, who never seems to age. Maybe they just switch her out when the last one dies.... Plus there are ALWAYS weird-looking people sitting nearby who order it up something ferocious, and it's fun to discuss what they could possibly do for a J.O.B. with those white-people dreads.\n\nThat is not to say that service isn't good, because it is.\n\nI couldn't believe it, but someone who went to the Veg House with me actually decided right then and there that he liked tofu. He had never had it before that day, save for a few nightmares, which is just unfair.\n\nI do wish it were open more, though. Kind of a PITA to drive up only to find the place locked."
1,"we visited vegas and were looking for some authentic, tasty indian food near the strip.we checked some ad in the local magazine and decided to go visit this restaurant.\nalthough this place is a little away from the strip, its not very hard to locate.i should mention we visited this place around 7:30pm, so its was not rushed.the staff was very courteous,the naan very yummy though pricey.we had ordered the paneer tikka and chicken chilli as appetizers and chicken makhani and paneer kadahi.we ordered a side of yellow dal which was very tasty, unlike any other indian place we have been to.\neven with all these dishes, the dinner for four was very well in budget.\nI would recommend this place.do go try it."
0,"TERRIBLE service and WAY overpriced.  Checked this place out with some fellow locals, we have no problem paying strip prices but the service has to be worth it. Server was beyond rude and slow. Would never recommend this place to anyone... And unfortunately for them that's what I do for a job. It will be a miracle if this place stays open another day."
1,"This place used to be Thai Pots. Back when I started going here, the first week they opened, many years ago it was so small it only say 10 people and did mostly takeout. Over time they grew popular and expanded, eventually moving into a larger spot in the same complex and updating the decor to something more suiting their food quality.\n\nIt is mainly your standard Thai fare with a few surprises here and there since they expanded the menu. Nothing crazy mind you and it will not compare with Latitude 8 in downtown Chandler, but the prices are far less expensive and the menu more expansive. \n\nSo the food... very good. They have very good curries and the traditional Thai entrees are excellent.\n\nThe lunch specials are a good price at $8 - you get a lot of good quality and good tasking food.\n\nOverall this is an above average Thai place where the selection is very good, the food is high quality and you cannot go wrong with anything you order."
1,"Bertha is so amazing at what she does! I had my first Brazilian wax done by her, and she made me feel very comfortable and relaxed. So friendly! The prices are affordable. She definitely knows what she is doing and I highly recommend that if you want to get treated and pampered, you have to go to Bertha! Definitely going to be a faithful client to her from now on :)"
1,Great beer selection.  I've never eaten here but its a good place to grab a drink.  prices are decent.
0,"We came here with a party of 15 people for a birthday. It was a tuesday, so it was almost empty for this GIANT bar with a stage, and the performers were starting to get set up.\n\nI was ordering the food from a kind older waitress who was jottings things down on a napkin when I told her that my boyfriend and I were going to be on the same check. \n\n\""We don't do that here\"".\n\nOkay, thats fine. I'll assumed I could take my receipt and his, and just pay for both. I mean, there's no way they were going to lump 25 people on the same bill, right? I mean.. we had like 10 couples and a bunch of kids. I got the food, which was okay, said happy birthday, and wanted to head out after being there for an hour or two. \n\nI got my waitress, who seemed a bit over her head, and calmly asked for my bill so I could leave. She gave me a menu and said \""Figure it out for yourself\"". \n\nWhat. The. Hell. \n\nFigure it out for myself? What was the point of a register? Do I look like an accountant? What are City of Scottsdale taxes here, anyway? Are we on a barter system? Why do I even have to pay anything at this point, if it is some free-for-all where I tell you how much my food was and you maybe/maybe not charge me?! Seriously.\n\nI stood there, trying to talked to here, for 10 minutes and she just ignored me. Like in a bad movie, I was standing there, making eye contact, while another person who was supposed to be my server pretended I didn't even exist. Unbelievable. I was so furious, I almost lost it. I calculated it out, even though the cost of the drinks wasn't on the menu, and left. BAH!"
0,"Only come here if you don't care about how you smell afterward. \nAfter you eat here, there is a strong odour that comes with you afterward. \nTheir food tasted okay, but I heard people had diarrhea afterward, maybe their food is not that fresh..."
1,"Nice hotel connected to the Venetian. We stayed at the Venetian, but this one looks pretty nice as well. The restaurants and bars/lounges are plentiful and the location is great."
1,"Not a big ramen fan, but I really liked this place - food, atmosphere, service and reasonable prices. A great find."
0,"The staff here was very friendly and extremely nice.  However, I brought a ring in to be sized of which the jeweler in the back said he could do there.  When he was done I noticed the stone was now loose. I pointed it out and they said they couldn't fix it there they would have to send it to the main location.  I wanted to wear the ring so I kept it.  Then I realized a week later looking at the ring close up because the stone was loose, that the stone actually had a chip in it.  This was not there when I originally brought it in.  I was very upset.  Not only was the stone loose now in the ring, but there was a chip in the stone as well.  Not happy."
1,"Previously my wife and i had been living in the town of Lancaster in California, while there we got addicted to an all-you-can-eat sushi bar called Big Tuna. Best place we have ever been, excellent sushi, excellent service, excellent ambiance. Since moving to Vegas though we have been searching and searching for a place that comes close to matching it, and while we have not yet found such a place we both agree Yama Sushi comes decently close. \n\nThe sushi is well made and comes to you fairly quickly. While we have been to some locations where the sushi comes back to us at room temperature (ick) the sushi here is still nice and cool. My personal favorite is the garlic tuna, while my wife's favorite is the baked green mussels. The rolls are all pretty good, we have yet to find one we didn't really enjoy, though I do suggest being careful with anything that has cream cheese because it can be overpowering. Oh! And it is all you can eat desserts as well! Love mochi? Get as much as you like!\n\nDownsides? I hate it when you order a soda and they give you a can, especially at an all-you-can-eat place. I generally just stick with a water then. Also, sitting at the bar for any real length of time can be murder on your butt, but it is the best place to be for the all-you-can-eat sadly. \n\nAll in all this is the best place for sushi my wife and I have found in Vegas so far, and we have tried quite a few. Don't go towards closing hour and it should be a excellent experience!!"
1,"Had a team dinner here while in Vegas for work.  Good laid back restaurant, food was good and I didn't feel like we were wide open to the casino (as there are bathrooms inside and they make it really feel separate).  The appetizers were good - blue cheese chips and Steak skewers.  Calamari was just ok.  Two of us shared a pizza and it was perfect size after having appetizers.  The burger looked TDF.  The best part was desserts and they let use do 6 as two sampler plates, highly recommend doing that.  The banana cheesecake was amazing.  The others were really good also, even the carrot cake and I don't like carrot cake typically!  Good addition to the MGM."
0,"I was sent here for a ACE Fitness convention for my fire dept along with 4 other people. They told me they couldn't charge the credit card they had because it had to be the one used to make the reservations. (which isn't true because companies pay up front for group rates on one card) We were then told we had to have an actual credit card  (not debit card) to put the security deposit on. Unfortunatly i offered mine up since i was the only one in thr goup who had one. The RIO ended up charging my card over 15 times for 4 seperate rooms. \n\nIts taken me about 2 months to get them to credit my card and charge the cities card as they were supposed to. There was some type of problem with the DC gov't credit card so they went to the only one other one on file (mine) without authorization. \n\nThe only reason they got two stars, friendly (yet not competant hep), nice rooms with decent views, good -not great- location for decent prices, free shows and a good shuttle service.  I didn't like the overly priced drinks, all of the \""working girls\"" , extreemly smokey atmosphere some nights. The gym there was about 20-25 a day (rediculous) One of the guys with me had a leak in his room and they didn't imediatly move him to a new room to repair the leaky ceiling - he was supposed to be comp(ed) free internet and that was also charged to the wrong credit card (mine).The internet was $15?? a day or week (cont remember exactly) WHen most hotels offer free internet. I've contacted them about this several times and was offered no apologies after haing to move alot of money from my savings to my checking accounts to cover their mistake."
0,"This is most undoubtably, the worst hospital in the Las Vegas valley. \nParking is always a nightmare, a vast majority of the staff is rude and show no care or compassion, Attending Physicians hardly communicate with each other or their Residents/RN's etc, parts of the hospital lack serious house-keeping, food in the cafeteria is never anything more than lukewarm, emergency room nurses are rude and condescending, it's far too easy to gain access to any part of the campus.\n\nMy list goes on for DAY'S! Do NOT go to UMC. There are 20+ other hospitals that I'd rather spend my $1000's of dollars at."
0,"Really really surprised at the reviews here. \n\nI got the pulled pork sandwich, which was pretty terrible. It came out on a regular piece of toasted bread, meh. It also came with coleslaw on it, which some people may like, but it just was not good at all. \n\nAlso, no soft drinks here, can of coke only! What?? How does a business like this survive in america? \n\nMy girlfriend and I were both quite disappointed with both our meals, and certainly will not be returning."
0,Ordered 2 pies to go - one wood fired and one build your own - the lady that took my order asked if I wanted fresh cracked pepper - my request never made it - $40 later - I will stick with my tried and always true pizza joints .....neither was a stand-out or reason to go back.
0,"Nah....not quite on par with other interval international properties as far as the room and amenities but if you just need a place to crash with a kitchen, this will do nicely.   Beds are visibly sunken in and in need of replacement so sleep was rough.  During off peak, you can get 7 nights for $229 .  Can't beat that."
0,"Customer service?  Hospitality? What's that?\n\nI arrive for a late lunch at 3:20pm with about 40 minutes to kill before my flight home.  The restaurant is about 30% occupied.  The hostess leads me into the seating area and attempts to seat me at a small table for two.  Again the place is quite empty.  I request a larger table, perhaps one of other ten or more open 4 top available.  She says they are getting ready for the lunch rush and doesn't want to give up the tables for a party of one.  \n\nI remind her it's a little past three.  She says, \""Oh, the dinner rush\"". I mention again it's just after 3pm.  She lets me know the rush starts early. She offers another table tucked in the corner.  I think great, it's a less desirable table but with more space.  She leads me to another 2 top.  I tell don't bother I'll take my business elsewhere.  Which I gladly did.\n\nIt's my guess this is the way this restaurant operates from a management level.  Time to reevaluate your procedures."
1,"Last night, I went on a date and was taken to Postino Central. I think I'm going to marry him just for his taste in food and wine :)\n\nTo begin, the hostess let us know it would be a 30 minute wait. She took our name down and obviously heard me whining to him about how hungry I was... so she came back about 10 minutes later and seated us. That was incredibly sweet of her and I knew the customer service would be awesome.\n\nSo, the waitress tells us the special was bruschetta and a bottle of wine... for $20. I couldn't believe what she was saying. $20... for an entire bottle of wine AND four different selections of bruschetta? Is this real life? \n\nYes, yes it was... and I was in heaven. We ordered salmon, tomato & mozzarella, artichoke, and white bean (which turned out to be hummus, yay!) and I feel those are the top four in my book. We also ordered the Pinot Grigio and it was a perfect combination. For dessert, he ordered an espresso ice cream and I ordered the chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream... both to die for. \n\nThen the bill came, and it was less than $35 altogether. So, I was a cheap date and happy to be so for this place! I can't wait to go back - 10 stars if I could!"
0,"Yelp has let me down on this one!!!!  I guess I might be asking for too much when I want decent thai food when I'm in Vegas.\n\nService was PISS POOR.  Went in, sat down fast.  Waited more than 5 minutes to order (AFTER they took order from other tables who came in after us).  Got thai ice tea quickly after order.  Waited decent time for food after other tables got their food who came in after us, but by then the waiters don't say anything to us for the rest of the night.  I guess that is ok, I don't want to talk to waiters who aren't nice to it's patrons.\n\nOrdered Pad See Ew with pork, Beef Jerky, and Rainbow Trout Dinner.  Pad See Ew was decent, but pork was extremely dry.  Beef Jerky was extremely dried by the deep fry with LOTS of fat attached to it.  The sauce for the jerky was very tart from the lime and makes you do a \""bitter beer face\"".  Rainbow Trout was burnt black on outside and very dry on inside.  I do not see how this place gets regulars, but I guess people here do not know how authentic thai really tastes.\n\nIf you want authentic thai, look elsewhere!!\n\nOh yeah...the \""Yelp special\"" of 10% off if you mention you saw them on Yelp DOESN\""T GET HONORED!!!!  I said it like three times and she didn't know what the hell I was saying.  Let's just say their tip INCLUDED the 10% they didn't honor.  This was generous too for the crap we got from the poor service and bad food."
0,"I could give this a 0 star if I could.\n\nSo they pulled me aside to question me about my year of graduating high school, etc. etc., procedures for a fake I'm guessing & threatened to call the police & confiscate my only ID if I didn't \""tell the truth\"" so I was forced to make up a fake birthday by saying I was 2 years younger in order to get my ID back & was told to leave the grounds. This was also for an event I had already pre-paid $50 for.\n\nEven worse, my friend who merely two days later with an actual FAKE ID who, although she is 20, looks far from it managed to enter the same venue for another pre-paid event. I thought Las Vegas, out of all places, would be used to properly identifying people of drinking age.\n\nOf course, I came back and watched the show from another pool but I suggest either getting better security guards who can actually distinguish fakes from real and maybe even buy, god forbid, a black light or ID scanner - because for a major company that would be so expensive!\n\nOne last thing, I was threatened to be blacklisted from all MGM owned places (which apparently is 75% of the Strip). I really don't care about any of these places so their words fell empty and I just felt harassed for absolutely no reason. Good job taking my money and leaving me without an experience I had been waiting for for months."
1,Everything from service to food was top notch!  I highly recommend Upper Crust!
0,"Another Groupon casualty.  We went there to have dinner the other day and saw that it was closed.  That's too bad.  I think Groupon did them in...they always had deals out there, how could they make any profits?\n\nReturn Factor - 0%"
1,The best mocha I've had in Edinburgh. Nuff said :)\n\nReally nice staff and a really pleasant atmosphere - perfect for a coffee house.  Don't be put off by the apparent small size - the real seating is through the door on the right!!
1,"I usually only come here for happy hour 10pm-close. The kirin is $3 and sake is also cheap. The various rolls and food that come with HH are also really good and cheap. It is a small and cozy atmosphere so come with a date or group of friends. It is right next door to PT's so once the restaurant is closed, you can go to PT's HH for more hours of happiness :D"
1,"First time trying Bistro Pizza.  We got the meatball and ricotta pizza, the bistro salad, and free garlic knots with our Yelp check in.  Everything was delicious.  The bistro salad had fantastic balsamic marinated tomatoes and red peppers, artichokes, and mozzarella.   The garlic knots are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and very garlicky.  They come with a yummy marinara dipping sauce.  The main event, the pizza, was very good.  Crispy crust, good sauce, the meatballs were very delicious.   It was a little more expensive than I expected, but we will be coming here again.  Maybe to dine in since they have booths and board games."
0,"The name is fitting because that's what practically covered the joint. This place was empty when I visited. I got tumbleweed stuck in my hair. We had to invent people to talk too!\n\nNot the staff's fault, they seemed very nice. Just not a popular place anymore."
1,"Just adding to the long list of great reviews! I've never been to a place that had so many beers on tap. It was awesome. Plus, it's not that pricey either."
0,"I read Yelp about this, but still I went.  I was a prisoner to Luxor.  How bad can it be?!\n\nDISGUSTING DISGUSTING DISGUSTING DISGUSTING DISGUSTING\n\nYou have been warned.  There is a reason why you can't see the food until after you pay!  The manager refunded me and you could tell he's done this countless times.  He seemed defeated.\n\nRun!  Run far away!"
1,"I got my hair done about a month done before my wedding, which I am in love with! I barely said anything about the way i wanted it and it was more then i could ever ask for. Also, I had my wedding updo and makeup done here, once again I was blown away!! I love all the girls here!!"
1,"This review was a bit late but we went here a few months ago for my friends Birthday and it was great. Between the apps, meals and desserts we were all happy. I don't remember what everyone ordered but I remember sharing the calamari dish and the cheese,meat and veggie chef  board and they were great we could not get enough. For my entree I ordered the the Riccota Gnocchi with braised short ribs, the Gnocchi was perfectly cooked and the braised short ribs melted in your mouth. A lot of us shared our entrees with others and I got to try the bolognese with fresh pasta and there is nothing like eating fresh pasta, I also tried the fig and  prosciutto  pie and that was awesome (besides the goat cheese I do not like goat cheese. Don't judge me). I ended my night with the Bombolini , I also shared these with others and loved them along with tasting the salted caramel budino. next time I go back I am set on getting the bolognese and the Salted caramel budino. I def suggest going here the service was on point also."
1,AMAZING! Not much to look at it doesn't matter when the food is perfect. I live close so I will be going ALL THE TIME. Such a great find!
1,"Great little airport with plenty of shop, restaurant, and snack options. Security line goes fast and everything looks clean and new."
1,Two Words: Sushi Bar\n\nYes they have a sushi bar inside and yeah it is pretty decent!
1,"I've seen many of the magic shows in Las Vegas, and Jan Rouven is absolutely among the best..  This is a must-see show.    It is very entertaining, and the theater is not too large so everyone has a good seat.\n\nThe venue for the show is the Clarion hotel -- it is just off the strip near the north end.  The Clarion describes itself as a hotel/casino, but the casino only has slot machines.   \n\nThe show is targeted at adults, but there is no \""adult\"" content - so it is safe to bring your kids and they won't be bored.  It is not, however, a \""family-centric\"" magic show like some of the afternoon shows at other venues.\n\nI give this two thumbs up."
0,"Ever heard the saying \""Jack of all trades, master of none\"".  \nIts a donut shop, its a deli, its a cafe, its a family restaurant, its an Asian fast food place...well, we found out differently\n\nWe were looking for something different for lunch so turned to Yelp and decided to try the \""Ninja Bowl\"".  Then found there is no place with this name.  No street sign, no door marker legend, no mailbox.  Nothing.  We had to do some hunting and asking (I hate asking) and found out the truth.  There are four names on Yelp for the same address and same location:\n1) Ninja Bowl\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/ninja-bowl-phoenix\naka\n2) Rainbow Donuts Bakery & Cafe\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/rainbow-donuts-bakery-and-cafe-phoenix\naka\n3) Rainbow Donuts & Deli\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/rainbow-donuts-and-deli-phoenix\naka\n4) Bobby C's Cafe\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/bobby-cs-cafe-phoenix\n\nAll the same address, phone number and location.  I charged it on my Credit Card and it showed up on my bill as Bobby C's Cafe.\n\nHad a terrible time finding it and while I only tried the Sizzling bowl the cost of $8.90 for rice, finely chopped chicken and gluten spicey sauce plus small soda doesn't warrant another visit."
1,"Decided to come here as we had tickets to Blue Man group and for $2/person we got 25% off the food bill. Very glad we came! Restaurant is conveniently located but still quaint and quiet. The service was very attentive and we liked the menu. Prices are very reasonable. The calamari was ok, nothing tremendous but solid. The wife had linguini with clam sauce, which she liked but did not rave about. I got a Pancetta pizza which I really liked. For $15 it came with 8 pieces!  Way too much food (but it was nice to have some munchy food for our walk on the strip later).\n\nOverall a good experience. Drinks were expensive however ($12-$15 each) and they didn't list the prices on the drink menu so beware.\n\nI would go back if in the hotel, not sure I would make a special trip for it though."
0,"Words cannot even express how much I hate this place. It's literally five minutes from my house in Tempe and everybody and their mother loves it here. I've been here four times. FOUR CHANCES, and they blew every single one.\n\nVisit #1: I go with a handful of girlfriends. Order a margarita. Worst margarita of my life, hands down. My friend also ordered one and hated it. We both had to send it back (the first and only time I have ever sent a drink back. It was that bad). We told our server that we'd like something different, but we needed a moment to decide. She rolled her eyes, took them away, and we didn't see her until much later, when she delivered our bill. I had no drinks that night.\n\nVisit #2: I went with my husband for lunch. Ordered the crab sandwich. I took a bite and it was an effort to swallow it, it was so disgusting. Now, I used to live off of eating out just about every day of the week. My husband and I are always incredibly polite to our servers and feign enjoying meals that are sub par. Getting meals you don't like is a part of life. This, however, was inedible. For the second time ever (I never send food back, I know how annoying it is for the servers and feel so bad), I had to send it back and ask for something different. Our server seemed really perturbed, but did bring me the meal I ordered instead. It was mediocre at best, but I ate it without any complaint. I apologized profusely to our server and assured her that I liked the new meal, even though I didn't, in hopes of her mood improving. It didn't.\n\nVisit #3: Don't even ask me why, but my husband and I were craving Oysters and thought that we'd give Casey Moore's Oyster House another chance to impress us. Not only were the oysters not good (we did not complain about them this time, though), but our server was so rude that we thought we had wronged her in some way. Dirty looks, only stopped by twice I believe in the hour and a half we were there, didn't say hello or smile once. We thought maybe we had caught her on a bad day, but the joyful smile on her face as she laughed with the table of men directly across from us quickly made us realize that this was not the case. To be clear, we did not complain about anything at any time. We were kind, polite, and didn't keep her from other tables. What the hell?\n\nVisit #4 (tonight): I went with a girlfriend for drinks after a run. I only went because it was a beautiful night and I wanted to sit outdoors. First off, we had my friend's dog with us and went to the front without the dog to see if we could tie him up outside of the establishment (around a tree). Nobody was there so we went back to get the dog to tie him up (again, outside of the place, by the sidewalk). A man promptly and rudely said, \""I'm not letting you two in with that dog out there.\"" Okay. So we took the dog back to the car and left the window down for him. When we got back and found a seat, I smiled and said hello to our server when he greeted us. Upon asking us what we wanted to drink, I said, \""There is a drink at Boulder's (bar down the street) I really like and was wondering if you guys might do something similar...\"" \""We don't.\"" He said, and just looked at us. That's it. I proceeded to tell him what the drink was (Strongbow mixed with a Raspberry type beer). \""No, I told you we don't.\"" Finally after awkwardly floundering about, my friend and I settled on another drink. We did get what we ordered and it was good (we both got Strongbows with a shot of Fireball). But seriously, dealing with TWO rude men tonight, plus the history I've had there, makes me realize I really will never go back ever. And I mean it this time.\n\nI mean truly, I am extremely polite and go above and beyond to make people feel comfortable and happy to be serving me. I smile big, say hello, don't take too much of their time, don't whine or complain, etc. But the fact that four of my all time worst restaurant experiences were all from Casey Moore's is just too much to ignore. I hate that place and hate that I'm the only one who feels this way."
1,Nice place with solid menu items.  The cheese chorizo appetizer is awesome although I wish they'd bring back the pretzels that went with it. The 20 year tacos are awesome. Also the chicken madeira is one of my favorites. Tonight we tried the French dip which was great too with perfect bread and a great horseradish. \n\nService was fast and friendly!
0,"My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the \""list\"". We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of \""out of towners\"" who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before). \n\nWe subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night."
0,Food is good. Customer service sucks!!
1,"oh man, when ever the girls are in vegas.... after a long nite partying and after sleepin' in until 4 in the afternoon -- nothing is better than getting a delivery of lucille's bbq -- slab of ribs and steak and jambalaya!! they are soo good....\n\nwhen the boys that we left back home have behaved well and were good while we were gone -- we sometimes remember to stop off at lucille's for lunch right before our flight out and bring them a slab home... =P"
1,"I met the owner, Sam when he worked at a chain prior to opening Goodfellas.  I wanted my son to have time to feel like a boy because he's stuck with his single mom and big sister all the time so I took him to a \""real\"" barber shop for the first time when he was 3 and gratefully we got Sam when we walked in.  Sam left the chain to open Goodfellas and he personally called me to tell me where he would be so we could continue coming to him.  My son is now 8 and looks forward to his visits to Goodfellas every 7-8 weeks and adores Sam.  Sam knows my family and genuinely cares for me and my children.  I always buy gift cards for the men in my family and I have never heard anything bad from them about the service they receive.  These people will treat you like family and always go above and beyond what is expected of their services.  I HIGHLY recommend them."
0,Rooms aren't bad but the rooms bathroom is disgusting. AC didn't work and the maid stole something from my room. \nGood music at the pool but overall place was whack.
0,"I went to Point Brugge with the understanding that they had the best mussels in east Pittsburgh. I'm from out of town and was looking forward to my dinner. I'm not sure I've ever seen smaller mussels served at a restaurant. The sauce was great, but it was served in a large bowl, so the broth cooled down in 5 minutes. The rest of the menu looked great, but I would never go back again. Unfortunately, my friend's salad looked better than my mussels. Also, their Web site does not have a contact e-mail, so it's hard to give them criticism that could improve their food."
0,"Went back to Aureole after about 2 years and a very good meal. Mandalay Bay has become rather seedy like the rest of the strip. Entering the restaurant one is \""greeted\"" on a very cool level by a maitr D' speaking to a helper. They continued their conversation for a few minutes before seating us. Not an auspicious beginning. The menu arrives and it is their most expensive, the tasting menu. We asked for their other menus, a prix fixe and an a la carte. They seated us in the Swan Court which used to cost an extra $10, petty no. They don't charge that now but you have to have the tasting menu there. When I told them, in less coarse terms, that they were nuts, they said I could stay there with any menu. Whooppee. The 4000 bottle wine list has 2 Beujolois, none of them high quality. The wine is horribly overpriced, I would guess 400% over cost. A pleasant young man acting as sommelier hung in and finally bought us an OK Spanish wine for $75. We ordered a la carte. A foix gras we ordered turned out to be seared, not a pate. They rectified that. If you are very strong you can get what you want. The service was good, the food excellent. Bottom line the place has absolutely no class. There is nothing elegant about it or the hotel. Upon leaving we asked them to call the valet to get our car ready. That was against their policy for some really inane reason. As I said, no class at all. We will never return."
0,"have driven by this place since it opened - I should have never stopped this time....\n\nfigured it would be a typical sports bar with the typical food - it was and maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if there was more than one server for the entire place.    Thankfully, the poor girl had an amazing attitude - i sure wouldn't have if I had been her.\n\nthe food was what you would expect from bar food - the wings were good, hubby's pork sandwich was good - the side he got was wrong, but we didn't complain or he probably would never have eaten.\n\nI have been on a mac and cheese kick lately and this mac and cheese had bacon and amazing mushrooms, but obviously made with a brick of velveeta - which really isn't cheese in my book.\n\nthe clientel was interesting to say the least - by listening to the diners next to us we learned where to score some great weed....\n\nwe won't be back"
0,"As a long~time customer of this place, un4tun8ly giving my lowest rating thus far. Even though most other Xs have been good overall, this last time has changed my feeling about them. Over the wk~end, I had a craving 4 some chinese so an order was placed 4 pick~up instead of the usual delivery 2 avoid a tip as I had no cash on me & I don't like adding tips on cards. I had an associ8 go pick it up & when I asked 4 my receipt, I knew the total charged wasn't right (nearly $10 OVER) so I called them. \n\n   I asked 4 the amount of each item that was ordered as it wasn't reflected on the receipt & the menu I was ordering from had outd8ed prices.  Even so, calcul8ing the correct pricing it was still way over & then was told they charge 12% tax... Uhm, WHAT?? But even w/ that OUTRAGEOUS amount, some1 got paid about $10 tip for a PICK~UP order!! (Either that or I'm missing $10 worth of food I didn't order). They were given a chance 2 correct it & didn't even offer ANY rectific8ion. \n\n   I strongly feel that it doesn't matter if they knew this order was from an old~timer patron or some1 new to them (since I had some1 else picking it up) ~ if this is how they conduct business, I'm afraid I have 2 take mine elsewhere! @ least then I can get what is paid 4 instead of being ripped... EXTREMELY Disappointed in a place I USED 2 Like & frankly I should have disputed the charges on my card but they're losing much more than that in the loss of my business & what I've brought them... ;-("
0,"We visited here for lunch and were somewhat disappointed.  My friend, a real German, ordered roulade, red cabbage and mashed potato.  The roulade was fine but it wasn't really hot.  The mashed potatoes were definitely from a box - not fresh.  The red cabbage was OKish but only lukewarm.\n\nWe probably would not return - would probably try Zur Kate, which is in the same strip center."
1,"Good Service! I had the usual soup, salad and breadsticks."
0,"Beware! Went to pick up my new Apple Iphone 5C and then was told that I had to pay $200.00, NO I wasn't told that when I ordered it on a promotion.  Had a very nice guy by the name of Carlo Torres help me with my FREE order and said he would call me when my phone was shipped but when I came in to get it a whole new ball game.  What a rip off."
1,"Tina is amazing.  From day one, she took excellent care of me.  I had a horrific experience elsewhere and she gave me advice on what to do.  Best person I've ever had do manicures and pedicures.  I love the gel and how long it holds up.  Very grateful for a friend referring me to Tina.  \n\nI've watched everyone there work and everyone is always very nice, helpful, and listens to your requests.  It's nice to have someone that actually listens :)  Plus they are very clean, which is a VERY big deal for me.  I've been going here for a couple years and won't go anywhere else :)"
1,"Mix is my favorite spot in Vegas. Mix restaurant has a great atmosphere but the food is just ok for the price. (Crab salad excellent; fliet decent). Mix lounge is a great place to hangout. The view (top of the south end of the Strip looking north) is the best on or off the strip. I had assumed that the Luxor would block its view but that's totally not the case. There's an outdoor section divided up between general balcony and bottle service. I recommend the bottle service, not as pricey as a real club and more breathing room. And the waitresses are more attentive than other places. Not that the rest of the lounge is super crowded."
0,"It's been awhile Yelp. I haven't written a review for ages, but I was so compelled to write a review following my recent visit to the newly opened Wahoo's in town. \n\nNow, I've been to the original Wahoos franchise in San Diego for the first time last year and had an excellent experience. The food was excellent and the service was top notch. Before I dive into the service aspect about this particular Vegas location, I'll touch on the food a bit. Simply put, nowhere near the same. The quality of the food is average at best and the prices are a bit higher. The first time I went I was excited, a bit disappointing, but I was willing to go there again if I happened to be in the area. And so this particular night, I was.\n\nFirst and foremost, I'd like to consider myself a pretty patient and tolerable person. If a server takes awhile to refill drinks and/or doesn't seem to be \""trying\"" to cater to my very modest needs, I almost always shrug it off. But this particular night I was left beyond speechless. \n\nMe and a group of 5 or 6 walked into Wahoos looking to simply grab a bite to eat after a long night of drinking. The place was relatively empty, there was maybe one or two other people there. Right upon entering, a friend of mine immediately greeted the bartender with \""How are ya tonight sir?\"". The bartender responded with \""Don't call me sir\"" without a smile. We shrugged it off, sat down, an ordered promptly. Since most of us were only looking to eat, we asked if we could put in our food orders. He literally rejected our request and sternly stated that he would only take drink orders, and aggressively and rudely tried to convince each and every one of us to drink. \n\nAfter finally accepting our food orders, it took 10 minutes to get water. Another 5 to receive drinks. Most of our friends never even got theirs. When we asked about them, he spoke to us in a dumbfounded, i can do no wrong manner. \n\nThe wait for our food to arrive was average, and I was understanding because it was past 3AM and they probably only had one cook. But I reasoned that it was slow, and most of us had simply ordered taco plates. But then the food started trickling out of the kitchen one by one, each dish coming out 5 minutes apart. Not only did he forget who had what., but every single order was painfully incorrect. Every. Single. Order. We had simple, unmodified orders. Watching your friends eat one by one is extremely unacceptable. I've been in the foodservice industry, it's an industry standard to send food out together. One of my friends, the last to have not received his food, inquired about the status of his order. The bartender asked what he had ordered, smiled and said it was coming soon. We then watched him walk over and punch in my friends order, 45 minutes after he had initially ordered it, \n\nAfter that we all had enough and a few of my friends walked out the door. I have NEVER in my life have walked out on a tab, but when we started complaining he at least agreed to comp our bill, even though I told him I had no problem paying , because I knew I was never coming back. But while we were trying to figure out why everything went so wrong, he simply shrugged.\n\nI usually love to write reviews because I love spreading the word about great businesses and good eats, but this was the first time I came here, compelled to keep other people away from this place.\n\nMatt, I'm sorry \""sir\"" but you fucked up big time."
1,"Love this place, just wish it was closer to where I live!  We ordered breakfast entrees and a few pastries while we were waiting for our food.  I tried a little bit of my mom's meatloaf sandwich-different from any other meatloaf-but in a good way.  We split a guava croissant and chocolate croissant while waiting for our food-both were great.  my husband's breakfast sandwich was good too.  I had the stuffed apple french toast which was really good, but a little too sweet after eating the pastries.  The servings are good and the prices are reasonable.  They do run out of pastries-my mom was going to buy another guava croissant after we finished eating but they were out.  The place is also nicely decorated."
0,"We tried to eat here. I don't know why Paris thought it was a good idea to have this as the only place to get food in their nearly 3,000 room resort after midnight on New Years. On top of that, it looks like they didn't bother to fully staff it so a good number of the tables were unused and many that were being used stay uncleaned. We waited in line for about a hour, partially because they were letting all the Platinum and Diamond members in before everyone else. After a hour in line we were near the front when a group stormed out of the restaurant and told everyone in line to go elsewhere since they had waited 45 minutes for their food and were leaving since they had still not gotten it. This caused everyone in front of us to leave so we ended up at the front of the line, although we were still not seated since there were still Platinum and Diamond members waiting in the express line. After a second group left and told us the same thing (food taking forever to come), we too decided to leave. We waited a hour in line for nothing, although I guess it was better that we left since at least we were eating a few minutes later at another casino. Horrible planning on Paris' part."
0,"Just watched a World Cup game with a group of 15+ kids here. Food is decent, but beers were $7 each? The place has no atmosphere, you can't even tell what it is from the outside? In the middle of a retail/office park. Staff were friendly, just can't imagine it will stay open for much longer."
1,"My girlfriends and I found ourselves drunk and starving at the Forum Shops one Saturday afternoon. Too tired to find a cheap place to eat (which was hard in the Forum Shops) but not wanting to spend a crazy amount of money for lunch, we found the Cheesecake Factory! I know... we can find this restaurant back at home... but we were really hungry and the Factory never really had failed us in the past.\n\nWe were seated right away, and we sobered up quickly with their complimentary bread, lol. We decided to eat light (as we planned to eat greasy pizza later that night) so we ordered calamari and the luau salad, which were both very good and served in big portions. We ended the lunch with a macadamia nut cheesecake, in celebration for my late birthday with my girlfriends!\n\nOverall, it was a good experience with good food and good friends. We're glad to have found this restaurant while super drunk. Thanks!"
0,"Motel 6 with a broken down elevator. No wifi, food sucked and everything was way overpriced. WAY overpriced. The bed was comfortable. The pillows were not. The air conditioner doesn't have a thermostat in the wall. Way way outdated rooms. 25 inch tv?????  Look elsewhere.  Oh yeah, there's not enough parking for the guests let alone casino visitors.  had to park 6 gazillion miles away every time and mostly on top of the garage in the sun.  Bellagio was VERY nice, but I imagine you're gonna pay for it."
1,"Enjoyed Passport's freshly brewed java at Dimi Espresso, in Payson recently.  We then bought a pound o' beans to take home.  Just got to them this week.  Freshly ground and roasted in our semi-pro espresso machine, Passport is easily amongst the top five brews that have come out of our machine in the past 10 years!  The espresso is strong, full bodied, ultra (and I truly mean ULTRA) smooth, with no hint of bitterness, and just the right amount of brightness.  Truly a perfect cup o' brew.  If only we could bring Passport to San Antonio, Tejas.  OVERALL: STELLAR.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
1,"Not sure what the bad reviews are about. I did only just move in this weekend, but so far I'm elated! The apartment is really amazing. The view is phenomenal. Yes, it's an older building, but I'd rather think of it as classic Vegas! The amenities are great, and so far everybody I've met, neighbors and staff, are very friendly. The staff has gone out of their way to make my move into the building as smooth as possible. Maintenance seems to be within an earshot if I need them for anything. The neighborhood is obviously not the greatest or safest in Vegas, but you don't have to move in here to realize that. As long as you're in the building you're pretty safe. They went to great lengths to secure the property from unwanted guests.\nBottom line is that I knew what to expect moving in here. It's not Summerlin. This is my first time living this close to the inner city, and it's perfect for my current situation. Number one factor was that they accepted my pit bull (upon meeting her). Secondly, I'm not having to deal with the witch hunts of intrusive HOAs and nosey neighbors with sticks up their asses. I feel very comfortable here, and foresee no major issues that would convince me that I haven't made the right choice moving in. And it has to be said again, I'm looking out my windows right now and I'm just in awe of this view!!"
0,"Do not live here! I currently rent here. It's pretty cheap, compared to other places nearby, but that's for good reason. I moved in around the middle of July and have placed a maintenance request at least once every other week. The apartment is full of very out-of-date appliances that break often, and the maintenance crew is not very good at getting to requests in a timely manner. The staff is not very nice, as a whole. I mainly speak with one woman on staff, and she is wonderful. However, I went to get a package tonight from the main office, which closes at 6pm. It was 6:10 when I got there and I knocked on the locked door, just to see if someone was still around and could quickly grab the little box from the back room. A woman I'd never spoken with opened the door, and very rudely and condescendingly told me that they were closed. I told her I was only looking to pick up my package from the room right over there, and she, very rudely again, told me that they were closed and that \""you can get it tomorrow.\"" She kept repeating, as if I were a child who didn't understand English, that I could come back in the morning. \nI'd think that, considering they know that people don't like this complex, they'd at least try to be helpful."

0,"I had been going to this dentist for over a year when I realized it was time to switch.  The problems in a nutshell: not gentle, not thorough!  Unfortunately, this was to the detriment of my dental health.\n\nDr. Hood noticed I had inflammation on one of my gums during a regular visit, and he prescribed some steroids.  I did not use them as I avoid that kind of thing, and I figured there was a cause and the steroids would just be helping with the symptoms.  The inflammation went away on its own but came back a few months later.  The next time I went in, I told them about it.  They did nothing.\n\nAs well, I had fillings twice.  When I had them done, they put a block in my mouth to hold my mouth open wider.  I have a hard time opening wide - it really hurts my jaw.  One time the dentist did that, when he finished I almost couldn't re-close my jaw.  That's when I realized I had the wrong dentist.\n\nI switched to another dentist - female that also works on children.  They never need a block to work on my teeth, and never hurt my jaw like that.\n\nNow the big deal is this: At the new dentist, they found I had a large amount of plaque built up under the gum that had been getting inflamed.  It was obvious the previous dentist hadn't been getting it cleaned and it had been building up for a long time.  They found two spots where this had happened.  Too bad for me, it caused my bone to regress in those area, and they said it won't grow back.\n\nNow I know - a bad dentist is a really big deal!"
0,"Party America is back open again and they have been having this 'Clearance/Store Closing' sign up in their window for awhile but each time we would try to go they were closed. So apparently they close early, come earlier. \n\nWe finally were able to make it, but most of the store was taped off. A few aisles with mundane stuff we weren't interested in were on clearance so that was a bust. They were starting to put out more Halloween items so I guess they are going out of business but staying in business until after the Halloween season. Hopefully I can go back when they have put more stuff out."
0,"I will gladly post and provide the police report to any owners. Further comments from Tammy will result in not only Tammy's arrest but a civil suit against her. Any further communication is considered harassment. Wiggles and Wags is not the place to bring your pet. If you do then you are foolish. They use to have one girl who was great. Otherwise, the place really has horrible customer service. Hopefully your pets do not have any medical conditions if you choose to bring your pets to Wiggles and Wags as they will be in great danger."
1,"I LOVE this place!  Definitely the best burger in Charlotte.  The beef is savory and flavorful and their sandwich combinations are creative and tasty.  Onion rings and sweet potato fries are also wonderful.  I also like the atmosphere... small and friendly.   If it's crowded you can always get take out!\n\nEach time I've gone I've been too full by the end of the meal to enjoy the adult milkshakes, so if you want one then save some room!"
1,"After a long hot bike ride, we found this place nearby and decided our legs could use a little post-ride walking to stretch out.  So we walked over and headed on inside to...a very empty restaurant.  It was only like 4 in the afternoon and the kitchen wasn't supposed to open for almost another hour, but we were hungry! \n\nThankfully, the owner and the cook were very accommodating and let us put our order in then.  We would have been really disappointed if we had to leave with empty stomachs.  I ordered a big juicy burger with fries and it was awesome.  I was so hungry that I demolished the whole thing."
1,"Poke Express is seriously a gem that I am so glad I discovered while we were in Vegas.  At first, I was a bit skeptical to try it because how could there be fresh poke out in the hot ass desert?? BUT I decided to put my faith in Yelp and went to check it out anyway and I was glad I did.  All the poke selections average about $15/lb, but you can order by the half pound and quarter pound as well.  Mikah (?) and all the workers were very sweet and helpful.  They offered samples and gave us their opinions when we were unsure of which ones to order.  I ended up getting a half pound of their salmon and a half pound of their spicy combo.  If you get the salmon, be sure to ask for their special sauce.  It looks so simple, but oh so good! Don't skimp out on the onions either ;)  Their spicy combo is a mix of spicy mayo, tuna, imitation crab, cucumbers, and avocado.  This one was also good, but a little too rich after awhile because it had a too much spicy mayo for my liking.  Another thing I love about this little shop is that they also carry various Hawaiian specialty items such as soy sauce, drinks, pancake mixes, candy, etc.  I would say the only con about this place would be that there is nowhere to eat.  We were so hungry so we just ate outside on the steps, but there is a park across the street or you can wait for one of the surrounding restaurants to open."
0,"Service is okay. Mac n cheese sucked, noodles were mushy and it was chalky. The Catfish was bland. The chicken and gravy was good, and the Kool aid in the jars was kinda cool and unique. Overall, disappointed."
0,"Was brought here by a couple of friends who kept raving about the food.  My first and last time.  I begged them to try another place to compare.  \n\nThe meat resembled rolled up frozen deli meat of poor quality.  Nothing fresh, very tasteless and dry.  The selection of veggies looked sad and very picked-over.  I was disappointed that there was not an option of adding an egg.  And the starch choice was noodles or plain rice, that's all.  Lots of choices of sauces but they still couldn't make it delicious.\n\nBut wait...  free frozen yogurt!  I could care less.  I eat at Mongolian grills for the Mongolian, not crappy generic soft serve.  And then to be charged for a to-go box?  That's ridiculous.\n\nI will go to Genghis Grill instead.  Quality trumps quantity any day (not to mention actual service.)  Even the Mongolian Grill at the Banner Desert hospital cafeteria is better as far as taste and quality goes (not to mention WAY cheaper.)"
0,"this is one of the most disgusting restaurants I have ever eaten in. WE ARE\nHERE visiting our winter home in Queen Creek, ordered lettuce chicken\nWraps and burgers and discovered the meat tasted acrid, close to being\nSpoiled and we are all laying around with severe heartburn and a stomachache as we speak. we are from Chicago and have some of the finest food in the world, and truly have discovered that QC is not a place for people\nWho love truly good food. I have never seen so  many fast food restaurants\nIn one area.  Truly sad.    Do NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE! the best part\nWas that the.manager came by and took our plates away and did not \nCharge us for the food.............be careful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
1,"Felt like I was back in Pyeongtaek, Korea!! Had the bulgogi plate (the 1/2 was more than enough) and it was delicious. Nice price and nice service"
0,"When we first walked in we didn't know whether to wait to be seated or seat ourselves, being our first time there, so we just stood there.  We waited long enough to consider leaving and going somewhere else.  There were under 10 people in the restaurant and no one was up front to greet us.  Finally one of the employee's told us, from the back of the restaurant, that we could just sit anywhere we wanted.  We were given a high chair that had to be wiped off first before we could even use it.  The server wasn't very friendly, my husband asked how she was doing and she said nothing then said, \""what would you like to drink?\""  We both ordered the number 2--- two bacon, two sausage, two eggs and either home fries or two pancakes - we got the pancakes. We got our eggs scrambled with cheddar cheese added.  The star of the breakfast was for sure the bacon (nice and crispy) and the pancakes.  The eggs and sausage were good, but they were nothing to write home about,  just the everyday eggs and sausage.  For the little one, I got a scrambled egg and some buttered white toast.  The toast was nice and thick, perfectly toasted.  The cost for all three of us to eat with a $5.00 tip was around $32.00, not too bad and the food was good and the portions were  big, especially the pancakes.\n\nThe inside was a bit drab.  Considering it was a diner, I expected a more upbeat 1950's vibe with bright colors and some music, it did not deliver and the bathrooms were kinda scary and had a bad odor to them. They have been at this location for about 6 months now and I would like to recommend a sign for when customers first come in that says \""seat yourself\"" to avoid confusion on what to do, spruce things up a bit to look more like a diner and work on de-funking those bathrooms! Overall, it was just o.k. I don't know if it left enough of an impression for us to think of when we are looking for somewhere to eat."
0,"Awful experience, contacted and spoke with the regional manager and was told she would call me back with an answer. Never received a call back. This store has MANY personnel problems.\n\nSorry JCP, I can see why your stock is tanking..."
0,"Do not go to this place for business. One they tried selling me 4 tires that were not my size said it was okay it won't hurt my car. I spoke to the dealer and 5 others who said never buy tires that don't fit your car. They also sold me one good tire knowing I was riding around on 3 bald tires. When I told someone about it because I didn't know any better, they told me to call them and take my tire back. As professionals any tire place know not to change one tire you change two or a set because it is ruining your alignment Never ever use them. When I told the guy what he did his response was \""well I don't care I gave you what you asked for, I did not have to tell you that\"" No morals whatsoever funny but they tried getting me to buy a set of tires too small for my car. Disgusting. Stay away go to someone else reputable"
0,"Firstly,,, I spend over $800 a month at QT stations in Arizona exclusively just on gas, sodas, kitchen, and etc. Now for the meat of this thing; the area is getting a little tough at sundown. Next door is a mental health / homeless shelter. Plus, you have drunk / cracked out homeless wandering the \""hood\"". You got individuals coming up to you aggressively panhandling to the point where it is in the grey area of threatening / intimidating / attempted robbery. The staff at the store refuse to \""patrol\"" the lot, thus resulting in confrontations between drunk belligerent homeless subjects and normal customers like myself. I have complained so many times to the store staff, asst mgrs, and store manager. Useless. Nothing is done except \""oh, we called PPD\"". When the drunk continues towards me in an aggressive and threatening manner demanding money, this is where pepper spray gets presented and the tables are turned and I am no longer \""prey\"" for the criminal. Why should I have to \""gear up\"" just to go to this crappy store and get a soda? I expect better of QT. This stuff is basically Circle K kind of behavior and exactly why I don't patronize Circle K. I will not return to this location till corporate resolves this matter. Armed security is needed in the evenings / early nights. As far as the ladies, make sure you know how to defend yourselves with training, training, and more training. Make sure and bring your defensive tools as permitted by law. You might need them at this location in the evening ; (   Quit depending on PPD to provide security for your store # 440. It is private property and QT corporation is responsible to provide for the customer's well being and safety while they are on the premises. Not, the PPD. Filed complaint with QT Corporate Office regarding this incident as well."
1,"Found this place on yelp. They took a look at the issue in my vehicle, said what the issue was, gave a quote and now they're fixing the issue. I really liked the \""say it like it is approach\"" and the fact that they didn't say 8 million things was wrong with the vehicle. Straight pricing. I'm very happy! Oh, they even offered me a ride home because they said the job would take a couple of hours :) I'll make sure to refer these guys to my friends when they need work done on their vehicles."
1,"Cork & Bottle is a great neighborhood liquor store. They have a well-curated selection of wine, beer and spirits. Overall, the staff is friendly and helpful; especially with questions about wine. The store is on the small side so they won't have everything, but that shouldn't stop you.  Sure, you can go to Woodmans or Hyvee and find every alcoholic thing under the sun, but I urge everyone to come out and support a wonderful local business. If they don't have something, just ask and they will happily point you to an acceptable alternative. \n\nBonus: Come on Saturday between 3 and 6 for a wine tasting. I've also seen some random liquor tastings as well."
0,"Phoenix has a large but scattered population. I'm not sure why developers picked this location for a Chinese Culture Center.  It doesn't make sense to me as the area around Dobson might seem more appropriate.\n\nThe center seems like it'd have potential if it gave incentive for small businesses to set up shop and stay.  I've heard the lunar festival held here charged admission and was dismal.  It's now not much more than a nearly-empty strip mall with \""Asian\"" architecture.  I live up the street and would rather drive to Mesa/Chandler for anything Asian. Sad because I hoped Phoenix could do better."
1,How to start this review? \n1st. Went and gave my reservation and was immediately sat at our table.\n2nd wasn't sure what to eat but I knew I wanted a good steak so waiter suggested chefs menu.\n3rd was expensive but after few questions went with it.\n4th I left the selection up to him and boy did he did not disappoint 3-4 things off each course plus dessert selection to die for!\nWith all that said this was easily best meal I've ever eatin. Yes it was expensive but well worth it. Think I will do it again before I leave Saturday.
1,I've been using Maidly since they launched and have been happy with their service. Booking is a piece of cake!
0,"Saw groupon for this place and I am open to try new place so my bf and I went there. We got $50 of food for $24.\n\nWe got edamame, garlic shrimp, hot feel clam, hot pot and lamb skewers. menu was really confusing and the server doesn't seem like she know the menu well.\n\nEdamama came out cold and the flavor of other dishes were very bland. The whole dining experience was very forgettable. we won't be coming back again.\n\nsuggestion to owner: if you are giving discount to attract new customer through groupon, make sure that your food and service is good so people will come back. First 2 years of business is crucial, and unless you improve your food and service, i bet your business won't survive. Because people will only come for the deal and never come back again later."
0,"We used to go here all of the time.  Then one day the waiter refused my substitution of a flour tortilla for corn on my enchilada, despite having requested and received this modification on countless occasions before.  It got ugly.  Turns out that they would not satisfy my request because they made all of the enchiladas in the morning and would not make a fresh enchilada for me. I was livid.  This was WAY before I discovered Yelp.  I asked to speak with the manager who was a total jerk.  I vowed never to return.  Three years later...I happened to be in a forgiving mood and we happened to be in the neighborhood so we decided to stop by and try it out again.  Alas, the prices had climbed too high, the food wasn't as good as we remembered, and the service sucked (they got my husband's order wrong) and the rest is history.  I vow once again never to return."
1,"Really good service.  James at the bar made some really good recommendations. The place is right next to Pizzeria Bianco.  So while you wait for a table there, come here for a drink and kick it.\n\nThey also have a great wine menu, if you're into that.  I guess on Fridays they have a live band playing inside."
0,"Avoid Sprint if you can. They have the worst cell reception out of all the major companies.\n\nI am in scottsdale, right next to scottsdale rd and macdonald and cannot use the phone at my house. Even when I am traveling, the phones reception is always poor. I would use anyone but this provider."
0,Soggy flavorless pizza served on unwarmed ceramic plate. Carbonara was watery and made with cream instead of eggs. Gnocchi was tough as opposed to light and airy.
0,"They have removed all the pastries cookies sweets and treats, very limited on some pastries maybe a cookie or two but no more raspberry cheesecake any of the fancy stuff that is all gone fancy drinks are gone it used to be a really fun place to come to an evening or anytime it has gone downhill seriously, we would never return to this place, I had ham and cheese croissant,It was bad, I get a better and cheese croissant at McDonald's, The restaurant still looks the same but it's it's very depressing the main bar on the floor facing Paris is no longer  open anymore, They only had 2 Waiters on the floor really slow service so sad."

0,"I hope that I'll have to edit this review one day...\n\nI walked into Ulta a few nights ago.  Honestly, I looked like a hot mess - straight from the gym, no makeup.  Not nice.  I'm new to makeup too - the YouTube \""how to eyeliner\"" kind of girl.  Ulta can be an intimidating place...\n\nAnyway, walk into Ulta.  Girl at the registers says hello.  I wander all over the store looking for that Naked eye shadow, you know which one... Super pretty, I think it's just under $20.  Searching for that, know what I want, just not where to find it.  There are associates EVERYWHERE, but none of them paying attention to me.  Two associates helping someone else.  One walks by me (while I'm browsing clearance) but doesn't say anything.  I wander around some more, obviously looking for something - and no one offers to help or even check on me.  ...ULTA, I JUST WANT YOU TO HELP ME SPEND MY MONEY.\n\nI finally found the Naked eyeshadow.  The color I want is out if stock.  No sales associates to be found.  I left.  No one said \""goodbye\"", \""thanks for coming\"", etc.  Maybe they'll be getting it in soon.  I wouldn't know.  C'mon Ulta - I wanted to spend money!"
1,"We used Az Best on time movers for our move from Scottsdale Az to East Bay San Francisco and were 100% happy.  Our house was a 4,000 sq ft home with a ton of heavy furniture. They were so carefull and considerate with everything. They were quick, experienced and knew how to pack tight without jeopardizing the belongings. Chad the owner, Levy, Marcus, and the other guy were very trustworthy and made the move as pleasurable and lease stressful as could be. Thanks guys!!!"
1,"Cool bar with relaxed feeling, a bit pricey though. The bartenders dances on the bar about every 20 minutes."
1,"If you want to enjoy a awesome b fast and listen to Phantom of the Opera tunes, this is the place to visit. Sit out front on the patio if you can and people watch.\n\nMy B fast order - corn beef with eggs and sliced tomatoes with English muffin. This is one of my faves for corn beef due to the corn beef is in chunks and is awesome tasting. The chef puts bell pepper's and a small amount of potatoes.  Yes it's pricey at $13.95 but it's all about the quality here. \n\nMy friendly waitress from Chicago Amanda was awesome and has worked here since  they opened - 13 years ago now. The Grand Lux is owned by the Cheesecake Factory and the menu reflects their similarities."
1,"Bring Margaritaville to LA!!! \nWhen I go into Vegas I enjoy drinking!!!! \nI am a fan of margaritas. I prefer just the house margaritas on the rocks with salt. The blended ones give me a brain freeze. I will admit that last time I came here I was a little buzzed and everything tasted good. But overall the margaritas are good. \nWhen it comes to the food I remember sharing a chicken sandwich with my friend. It was enough to be shared. Again, tasted great when you've had hours and hours of drinking. One of the first times I went there I got the nachos and they were HUGE! I'm not kidding -- you can feed a family of 4 easily. They are just to big and lack flavor. \nService was fast and friendly. It does get packed but a little short wait is not all that bad. Music is pretty cool and just a great atmosphere overall. Great place to start the night!!!"
1,"I'm a big fan of microbrews, so I loved this little spot. It was really easy to miss the place at night though, as the sign is very small!\n\nWhile the food menu is not very expansive (just hot dogs/nachos/etc.), they did allow us to order food from another restaurant, and even provided pizza menus for us.\n\nI also helped finish off the amazing pumpkin hefeweizen.  Last fall, I was on a quest to find the perfect pumpkin ale. Dogfish Head was in the lead, but I might have to reconsider if I get a chance to compare again."
0,"Really bad service, waited an hour for my food, water barely got refilled. I don't know why we had bad service while the restaurant is half empty. All entrees didn't get to the table at once and one order was messed up."
1,"GREEK LEMON SOUP.  It is what is supposed to be, delicate, soft and gentle comfort food.  5 alarm chili it is not.  Lemon soup it is."
0,"Tried to buy a new Jeep Grand Cherokee here.  Drove over from San Diego due to the low price advertised on the web sight. When we arrived we were told that the alarm system that was put on the vehicle  would raise the price $800.00.  We said we didn't want the alarm and would pay to have it removed, but they stubbornly insisted that they could not remove it under any circumstances and we would have to pay the extra money. Of course we were badgered endlessly and told that we didn't read the \""fine print\"" on the bottom of the web page.  (Never mind. There are too many other dealerships out there to put up with this crap.)  Walked out and  went to Auto Nation (not perfect but much better) and bought our suv there.  For the next two days they continued to call us about buying the car.  They just couldn't understand why we wouldn't  buy the car from them. ( Gee, I wonder. ) Also had a heck of a time getting  them to give back our deposit.  We are a couple of 60 year olds who have bought many cars in our lifetimes and  really hate playing these stupid games at dealerships. See Earnhardt, this is what you get,  a lost $$48,000 sale and a bad yelp review.  Was it worth it?"

0,"Negative stars.  I got the Cox Contour set up and it has been AWFUL.  I have to constantly reset the cable box even after I had a tech come out. You would think with all the bad reviews, that COX would have a representative reach out to people writing the reviews to see how they can improve their experience.  The worst customer service EVER, they need to talk with other companies who provide the best customer service such as: Zappos, Amazon, etc. Those are huge companies and they figure out how to do it the right way. If I could switch to Direct TV, I would, but my complex doesn't allow satellite dishes on our balcony."
1,"The Porch is Eat 'N Park's newest upscale restaurant, after the success of Six Penn.  Huge windows face Schenley Plaza with none facing Club Hillman--I dig.  Clean, modern chateau feel that makes me wish there was an ice skating rink on the lawn.  Alas...\n\nFor lunch, you order and take a number.  For dinner, it's full service. \n\nThe lunch menu ranges from $7-14 for an entree.  The grilled cheese was made with cheddar and thick thick bread--I approve!  It also came with the day's soup  so that's probably the best value on the menu.  To compare: $7 here with soup and  $5.99  for a grilled cheese with no soup at Hemingway's.  The chopped salad (pulled chicken, feta, carrots, cucumbers, sprouts with honey dijon) was super fresh...only romaine lettuce here!  The chicken was perhaps slightly drier than I preferred, but it is pulled chicken.  The server was very nice when I asked for no tomatoes.\n\nAt the beverage bar, the water is in jugs with lemon or cucumbers, which is a small detail I like.  It looks pretty and helps me forget I'm still in Oakland.\n\nThe wine list looked fine, but I was interested in the brews.  Like the food, it's all local:  Penn, East End, Great Lakes, plus one seasonal at $5 each.  Only one thing kept me from the beers--the craft cocktails.  I ordered an \""Almost\"" Arnie.  Having just returned to The 'Burgh from an extended stint in the South, I was prepared to be disappointed.  But, nope!  This Arnie is The Porch's own Limoncello and fresh brewed iced tea with mint: sweet but not too sweet, the mint was properly muddled, and the tea was strong.  I loved Arnie...it will be a July wedding for the two of us.\n\nLike others have said and will continue to say, the food is expensive for Oakland.  You either want to pay extra for better food or you don't.  However, the drink prices are great for the quality.  If I can have a $5 microbrew that I want here or a $4 Miller Lite that I don't want at any other bar in Oakland, then I'll pay the extra dollar.\n\nNOTE:  There are no reservations taken, but you can put yourself on their online wait list and skip the line when you arrive: http://www.theporchatschenley.com/waitlist.aspx.\n\nWIFI NOTE:  You can pick up Pitt's wifi from here.  Wine while I work?  Yes, please."
0,"My friends booked this spot because all the other hotels were full and ultra, ultra expensive for some reason.  We speculated: Well, the Olympics DO open that weekend...No, that can't be it.  I don't think the Olympics have much to do with Vegas.  How bout EVO??  Uhh, I don't think there are THAT many nerds going, and I don't think it's that big of an event...It's at the Tropicana for goodness sakes!  \n\nIt was only when we were going down the super-packed strip that it dawned upon me.  Oh my gosh, it's Chinese super lucky day 8-8-08!!!  Ughhh, what an influence us hardcore Chinese gamblers have over Vegas. First, the MGM lion thing and now this.\n\nAnyway, on with the review.  I'm not really sure what the theme of this hotel is.  From my guess, it's probably something to do with New Orleans and Mardi Gras.  After all, we did stay in the Mardi Gras tower.  But, then there's a Toby Keith honky-tonk bar downstairs.  The elevator arrangement of this place is hotel is rather confusing, and at first it was really hard to figure out the optimal route to our room.\n\nSpeaking of the room, it was tiny! There was hardly any walking space between and around the 2 queen beds.  And the bathroom was THE smallest Vegas bathroom I have ever been in.  I'm not even exaggerating.  And a cot set us back $30 per night. I don't reckon I'd stay here again."

1,"My experience at Delmonico Steakhouse was well-above average, but not as fantastic as I thought it would be.  First off, although we had made reservations well in advance, we had to wait over 20 minutes for our table.  All was not completely lost, however, since we passed the time in Delmonico's classy little, modish bar area where we got started on our red wine for the evening. \n\nThere was a bit of confusion amongst the servers shortly after we were seated, and we experienced a delay in receiving our selection of bottled waters for our table.  At Delmonico, they give you the option of choosing from a few types of bottled and mineral waters for an additional charge, or you can request just regular,complimentary tap water. After the initial delay, our water glasses were refilled continuously throughout the meal, however. \n\nLike most five star restaurants, at Delmonico Steakhouse, you receive service from several members of the waitstaff, which ensures constant attention and most of your dining needs are met without even having to request anything.\n\nThe interior of the steakhouse was minimalist, with tables covered in cream colored linens and simple, modern brown leather chairs for seating. The space had a slightly Mediterranean feel due to its coved ceilings.  No doubt because the restaurant is located inside the Venetian Hotel, they wanted to maintain a slightly Italian theme througout. \n\nThe restaurant, which was was packed with patrons, was also very loud.  I think the coved ceilings were extremely conducive to the noise level contained in the dining room.  This combined with brighter than desired lighting, created a slightly less intimate dining experience than were were anticipating.  \n\nThe food was very good, however.  We started with the crabcake, and it was tender, buttery and delicious.  Followed by that, were our iceberg wedge salads with bacon, blue cheese and all the yummies.  Hubby ordered the bone-in ribeye, and I ordered the bone-in NY strip, both were cooked to medium perfection.  For sides, we shared a huge, delicious baked potato with sour cream, bacon, green onions and cheddar. For dessert, we shared the caramel creme brulee, and it was very, very good.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our meal very much, and we would return here again for the food.  Our experience was just was not over-the-top fabulous because of the noise and lighting factors."

1,"CRAVINGS BUFFET\nThis is a decent buffet in the Mirage at Las Vegas. It's definitely improved over the years. I recall going there as a kid in the early 90's, where I met tennis star, Michael Chang, and got his autograph. Wide variety of foods here, but fast forward to 2008 and beyond, where the Cravings Buffet has expanded and vastly improved. There is quite an international feel to the buffet, ranging from Americano to Mexicano to Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese). Lots of cut meats to choose from and plenty of soups to try! Desserts included cakes, tarts, bread pudding, and a gelato bar! Drinks are free, so drink up if you're into fruit juices: orange, cranberry, apple, etc. Service was great too, as they servers regularly cleaned our tables and refilled our drinks. The food is arrayed around the the dining area in a wide circular arc, making you walk a bit to find your favorite foods (a little exercise within the buffet compound). Not a bad buffet in Las Vegas. Not the best, but hey, it's not Bellagio!"
1,"I wasn't sure if I should give this place three or four stars... four stars on week nights but more like 2 stars on weekends... I think I'll stick with four because everwhere sucks on weekends and it's not Biddy's fault!\n\nI used to be obsessed with this place.  Ok \""obsessed\"" might be a little strong but what I mean is that I lived 5 minutes away, the beer was really cheap (student recommends deals ... which, by the way stop at 11pm and the staff never said a word when we each bought 3 pints at 10:55... sometimes they'd just give us the deal even if it was after 11.  That's what I call love), and there's live music on nearly every night of the week.\n\nMy friends and I started coming here regularly when we developed a somewhat overly-extreme crush on the guy who plays there Tuesday nights (Matt).  Then one night Matt switched with his brother Andy (who plays Mondays) and the love bloomed.  Basically Matt and Andy are awesome musicians and Biddy's is a fantastic place for hosting their talent.\n\nOther than the music, I have to admit the food here is pretty damn good too.  Ok so I've only had the steak and ale pie and the fajitas but OMG the fajitas are amazing and I want one right now.  My friend Mel and I used to go there for dinner whenever we were hungover.. mmmmm.  The food's got a student deal too so it's 2 for 1.  \n\nBiddy's is, however, extremely shitty on the weekends because it's in the Grassmarket near the Cow Gate and it is therefore full of loud drunken twats from about 6pm onwards Friday and Saturday nights.  This is extremely unfortunate, but it's week-day coolness makes up for that."
1,"Officially our new hang out spot. We have been the last 3 Saturdays in a row! The atmosphere is great and we love the live music. Plus, 65+ beers on tap and great food! They also rotate the bands nicely...each Saturday (out of the last 3) they have had a different band. The one last night was great...never seen a lead singer play the drums before!"
0,"I read reviews for movies, restaurants and products all the time. How did I forget to read the reviews before dropping $200 on this show I don't know. I've always wanted to see it. I heard they changed it after a performer died, but I still thought it would be good. I was wrong. I wish I had seen it years ago before they changed it. We were not impressed, and there's too many other shows to see.  It was my girlfriends first Cirque show, and she didn't like it. Where's the acrobatics she asked? I didn't have an answer, as I was wondering the same thing. Go see Mystere or O at Bellagio if you want a Cirque de Soleil show, chances are you'll be disappointed with this one."
1,This is my favorite place for pho thai. Staff is very friendly and serves quickly. Take out available and is packaged nicely.

Im preggers so while i like coffee I tend to avoid coffee while I am in the delicate condition.\n\nHe was nice enough to make me a Grasshopper blended without coffee, so its mint and chocolate, basically a shake. Its really rich and sweet but its yummy!\n\nI'll be back and once i can have my iced tea fix daily, Ill Really be frequent!"
0,"Jimmy & Joe's ruined Christmas 2014. I had been a loyal customer for many years and my family and many friends will never give them another penny. They advertised a special to buy gift certificates and did not specify that that there were only a certain amount. I went in the day they said to, and they told me they were sold out. The ad did not say to get there by a certain time or that there were a limited amount. I had planned to use these gift certificates as Christmas gifts and instead I had to find alternate gifts and will tell those friends and everyone I can never to eat there. Note to Groupon buyers... when you use a Groupon at Jimmy and Joe's they use only half as many ingredients on the toppings as a non Groupon pizza. You do not get a bargain with a Groupon at this pizza place, you get a skimpy poorly made pizza."
0,"Wenn man die Architektur des Weinbrenner kannte und sch\u00e4tzte ist man schockiert, wenn man ins Besitos kommt und fragt sich, wie man solch sch\u00f6nen R\u00e4ume derart mit pseudo-spanischem Dekor wie aufgeklebten Naturstein, dunklem Holz und Flamenco-Kitsch-Bildern verunstalten kann. So stellt sich also der durchschnittliche Gast ein spanisches Restaurant vor? Das denken anscheinend die Erfinder dieser Art von Gastronomie.\n\n\n Was es sonst von unserem Besuch zu berichten gibt, ist leider nicht besser.\n\n\n Nach 15 Minuten stelle ich fest, dass die Herren an dem einen Nachbartisch untereinander spanisch reden, mit dem Kellner dagegen englisch.\n\n\n Nach 20 Minuten wundere ich mich, dass noch nicht mal Brot auf dem Tisch steht, obwohl die Gl\u00e4ser l\u00e4ngst wieder leer sind und bekomme als Kommentar vom Nachbartisch, ich solle erst mal warten bis das Essen kommt, bevor ich mich beschwere.\n\n\n Als ich 25 Minuten nach der Bestellung den Kellner frage, warum man nicht zumindest Aioli mit Brot servieren k\u00f6nne, erkl\u00e4rt dieser, dass es nicht am fehlenden Personal liege, sondern daran, dass der Grill nicht ausreiche, um die Bestellungen schneller zu bearbeiten. Als ich ihm erkl\u00e4re, dass Aioli nicht vom Grill kommt, geht er freundlicherweise in die K\u00fcche und bringt das Aioli mit Brot (1,80 EUR).\n\n\n Leider. Wer einmal Aioli selbst gemacht hat, sieht und schmeckt sofort, dass es nicht hausgemacht ist, sondern aus dem Eimer stammt. Ein genauer Blick auf die Speisekarte, auf der die enthaltenen Zusatzstoffe bezeichnet sind, best\u00e4tigt dies.\n\n\n Cangrejos en miel (4,60 EUR) schmecken wie Krabbencocktail in den 80ern.\n\n\n Verduras Mediterraneas (3,40 EUR) waren das Highlight des Abends. N\u00e4mlich tats\u00e4chlich ganz ohne Aromastoffe, Farbstoffe, Geschmacksverst\u00e4rker und Verdickungsmittel. Die Zucchini und Paprika haben recht ordentlich geschmeckt. Zuhause h\u00e4tte ich ein natives Oliven\u00f6l verwendet, aber so anspruchsvoll darf man im Besitos nicht sein.\n\n\n Patatas Bravas (2,90 EUR) sollten knusprige Kartoffelecken mit kanarischer Salsa sein. Tats\u00e4chlich waren es nicht knusprige Kartoffelecken in einer Art Ketchup-Mayonaise.\n\n\n Die Datiles en bacon (4,60 EUR) sollen ganz lecker gewesen sein, aber ich esse keinen Speck. Auch hier: Zusatzstoffe.\n\n\n Nichts zu meckern gab es auch an den Gambas al ajilio (4,40 EUR).\n\n\n Aber dann kam die Paella de marisco (13,40 EUR). Die dunkle Eisenpfanne sollte wohl suggerieren, dass hier authentisch gekocht wurde. Wurde es aber nicht. Der Reis war noch sehr k\u00f6rnig, dazwischen M\u00f6hrenw\u00fcrfel und Erbsen, denen man die Herkunft aus der Tiefk\u00fchltruhe ansah und auch, dass sie diese erst vor kurzem verlassen hatten. F\u00fcr die Meeresfr\u00fcchte galt dasselbe. Die Geschmacksrichtung der Br\u00fche, die sich nach einigen Minuten am Boden der Pfanne sammelte, l\u00e4sst sich recht gut als Knorr-Fertigpfanne-Paella beschreiben. Und selbst dieses Gericht kam nicht ohne Zusatzstoffe aus.\n\n\n Das Selters war gut, die Sangria ok. Die Bedienung war gut, wirklich freundlich und dem Kellner ist seine Loyalit\u00e4t gegen\u00fcber der K\u00fcche zugute zu halten. Er beharrte darauf, dass dort tats\u00e4chlich gekocht wird. Ich w\u00fcrde es - zumindest anhand der Gerichte, die wir versucht haben - eher als auftauen, anr\u00fchren, aufw\u00e4rmen, in-so\u00dfe-tunken und aus dem Eimer sch\u00f6pfen bezeichen. Aber immerhin wird man schnell satt.\n\n\n Der Innenhof ist noch so sch\u00f6n, wie zu Weinbrenner-Zeiten und war dementsprechend voll.\n\n\n Wer aber noch wei\u00df, wie selber gekochtes Essen schmeckt, sollte diesen Platz unbedingt meiden. Man kann auch drau\u00dfen sitzen und anst\u00e4ndig essen."
1,"Hubby and I finished dinner here a few hours ago.  Having read the reviews before we went, we were not sure quite what to expect.  Since we had already purchased the Travel Zoo voucher, we were already $79 into it.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised. We went early at 5pm, with reservations, since we had other things planned that night.  The hostess and wait staff were wonderful.  Our waiter Joseph made several recommendations which we were both pleased with.\n\nWe started with the crab cake, which was excellent.  I had the tortilla soup, one of the best I have ever had.  Hubby had the seafood Louie salad, he said it was great, very balanced between the greens and seafood.  He had the Kansas City Strip and I had the New York, both were cooked as ordered and had good flavor and seasoning.  We also added on the grilled asparagus and the garlic mashed potatoes.  We had the churros for dessert, which we found to be light and not greasy at all.\n\nThe prices are on par with all the other high-end steakhouses with the ala carte sides.  We felt that even with the additional costs, along with the voucher, we got what we paid for.  The decor is lovely, especially with the added view of looking out toward the fountain at the Aria.\n\nIt's not an every weekend place to go for dinner, but it was wonderful for a great meal and outstanding service.  We will be going again."
1,"Good traditional mex in my opinion.  My husband got the al pastor and it was DELISH! I kept picking the meat of his plate.  I had the cheese enchilada, chile relleno and crunchy taco with rice and beans and the plates are HUGE. Luckily this makes good left overs. Definitely check it out and get the pastor. So good!"
0,"No stars actually.  \n\nWe get to Ra to check out the happy hour and waited at the front for a while to get seated.  Then I said to my husband \""it's happy hour, we should just go to the bar area\"" so we did, found a small table with nothing on it.  Sat down - I was sort of annoyed that there was no hostess.  \n\n15 mins later a server comes over and asks if we were seated by the hostess - we said no and that we waited at the front for a while then decided to just sit down, and she said it wasn't a problem, she would get us menus and would be over in a min to get our order.  Sweet we think. \n\nNext the bitch of a hostess comes over with her stank attitude and literally threw my menu at me, to the point where my water almost knocked over, didn't apologize and barked at us \""you're not supposed to sit yourselves down, you're supposed to wait for me to seat you.\""  Do I look like I cared?  Come on, you work at a sushi place in the mall, not some 5-star Gary Denko joint.  Get over yourself. \n\nI was really annoyed.  Thank god our waitress was helpful and really nice, we left her a fat tip, hopefully she got it.\n\nI don't think I'll ever be back."
0,"I love a great Italian restaurant, and I've been searching for a great one since I moved here to Charlotte.  I purchased a Groupon, and decided to hit this place up on a Wednesday night with my partner.  I really REALLY love food, and I really wanted to love this place.  I don't give many negative reviews, but I was so disappointed in this place.\n\nFirst thing in the door, the hostess was not terribly welcoming.  Our server was a bit snobbish as well.  I realize that Dolce is a more expensive place for food, but I felt unwelcome wearing a nice pair of jeans and a nice sweater.   Also, the place was only half full, but it was really loud in there.  I could barely converse with the person sitting in front of me at our tiny table.\n\nOur food was quite slow to arrive, and when it did, parts of it were only lukewarm.  I ordered a salmon special there, and my partner ordered the lobster ravioli special.  My fish was cooked well, but it was WAY too salty.  I had a zucchini casserole on the side, which was lukewarm.  Potato croquettes came with it, which were pretty different from others I've had, and they were pretty good.  My partner could not even taste any lobster in the ravioli, and the sauce was too salty as well.  Believe me, I LOVE salt, but it was barely palatable with so much on our dishes.  I think it might have been the sauces they used.\n\nWhen dessert arrived, I ordered the tiramisu and my partner ordered the chocolate mousse thing (I can't remember the same, sadly).  The mousse was delicious and the texture was perfect.  The tiramisu was one of the best I'd ever had - a very strong coffee flavor infused throughout the whole dessert.  Dessert is the reason I don't give this place only one star.\n\nWhen the bill came, our dinners were $16 for the ravioli (about 8 of them in the order, total) and $18 for the salmon, and $7 each for the desserts.  I'm so glad I had the Groupon and only had to pay half.  Another thing that really irked me was that they added an automatic 18% gratuity to our bill for using the Groupon.  I generally tip 20-25% on an order, as a general rule (I've worked in food service, so I try to be very generous).   I was pretty insulted that the restaurant assumed that I wouldn't pay a fair tip using the coupon, especially since it did not specify on the Groupon that we would be required to pay automatic gratuity.  \n\nBasically, what I have to say is that I'm glad we had the Groupon, because it would not have been worth the $60 total + tip we had to pay.  I really wanted to go back on a Tuesday to try their homemade gnocchi, but I don't think I'm willing to put up with bad service and inflated prices.  Surely there has to be a better Italian restaurant here in Charlotte.  My final word of advice: expensive does not necessarily mean quality, at least in this case."
1,"For you, David S.!\n\nBack so soon?  Indeed!  After a nice dinner at Pin Kaow with Mamie P. and our hubs, we were wandering around convincing ourselves not to eat dessert.  Though Yelp indicated Popped was closed at 9, they were definitely open, and it was definitely after 9!\n\nWe met Zelma inside - when we told her we had a sarcastic staff member, she immediately asked if he was French, but he wasn't!  So we laughed at how the men working here are all wonderfully sarcastic (my humor rests with Daria, for those who are curious).\n\nWe sampled some more - bling bling cookies n cream, smores, white cheddar with the nitrogen, and more Marilyn Monroe.  I told Zelma what I got last time, and she told me she had something better - Flaming Lips!  I was not the only one who wanted a hotter pepper!  So this habanero-jalepeno blend became my next sample and eventual purchase.  She handled the large crowd in there well, and amused Eric R. and Dave P. and their techno-dorkiness by letting them mess with the iPad transaction program.\n\nWe'll be back!!!"
0,"Dear Hyatt--\n\nIt's time . Phoenix is becoming , or at least trying to become a big city and you need to seriously consider some upgrades. You are looking dated and tired. I suggest getting inspired and moving into the now. \n\nHere are a few suggestions :\n\nGo up to the eighth floor look out onto the atrium look at the tile and carpet It's hodge podge  , stained and worn out. Ick! \n\nRemodel to  a  contemporary look that embraces the southwest feel. \n\nDo something bout the curtains in the suites they look  faded and have strings hanging from the hardware.\n\nScrape off the popcorn ceilings and clean the other ceilings , I can see dust hanging in places. \n\nShow off your elevators with flair and panache. \n\nLove and Kisses ,\nme"

1,"As we were doing Route 66, this hotel was ideally placed. Check in is on floor 23 (luckily all the lifts are super-speedy) and we were able to do this immediately as there were no queues. The only thing that put us off was that a motorbike was being delivered to the hotel so that the following day we could begin our trip. The hotel receptionist informed us that there was a charge of $45 for the privilege of us parking the bike overnight at the front of the hotel (valet parking not given for motorcycles). We weren't able to park it in a secure location, just literally outside the building with a traffic cone placed by the front wheel (I put the traffic come there as it was in an empty parking space). \nThe hotel itself is clean but clearly dated. Nothing a bit of decor and soft furnishings couldn't sort out. The view of the Chicago skyline from our window was amazing and we watched both sunset and sunrise. We opted for room only as we decided to walk to Lou Mitchell's for breakfast (fabulous experience). Grant Park is about 25 minutes away (walking) and worth a visit. All in all, for just one night not bad. Be careful of getting stiffed on parking charges"
1,"We were lost on our way to Las Vegas.  I grabbed the Yelp app to find a place to eat and found Vogue.  I was able to book a table through Open table via the Yelp app which was very convenient.\n\nWe had the Vogue Burger and Vogue Salad.  Both were fantastic.  The blue cheese on the burger was bold, but the sweet glazed onions tamed the overall flavor and was surprisingly delicious.  The salad used a very textured lettuce I hadn't tried before, it was different but tasty.  I enjoyed had a Petite Sirah by the glass which was amazing, so smooth.  \n\nThe restaurant had outdoor seating which was very nice and comfortable, but it was a cold night.  The wait staff quickly fixed the temperature by turning on an overhead heater.  \n\nWe will definitely stop here again on our way to Las Vegas!"
1,"The service is great and speedy. I've been impressed with how clean the restaurant is, and the quality of food is outstanding."
0,"Carnival World Buffet is about par for course on a low-end casino buffet, but very large and with lots of food, and insanely overpriced. Wait in line for an exceptionally slow and poorly designed kiosk to charge you $20 per person for a buffet, plus tip. The kiosk prompts you for 15 or 20% tip, which is more than what you traditionally pay at a self-service buffet, and there is no option to tip a more conventional 10%.\n\nFor your $25 total, you can browse stations ranging from mediocre pizza to burgers to Chinese food. Some of the items are good, particularly the burgers, but for the most part, everything here is only a step or two above fast food, if that. The Mexican food, for example, had quesadillas that I think had American cheese in them with guacamole that consisted almost entirely of sour cream. And breakfast food, curiously, is dispersed across the buffet: waffles might be with the burgers, but eggs are probably next to the Chinese food.\n\nYou might be wondering why I checked in twice here. Did I mention you're a captive audience at the Rio? It's off-strip, so unless you want to take a cab somewhere, you're hosed. And I was with a group.\n\nThe bottom line is, you're paying $25 for $4 worth of crappy food with an outrageous gratuity for someone who only brings you silverware and a soft drink (alcohol is at a station only)."
0,Visited this restaurant for the first time with my boyfriend and it was awful. The service was very unattentive and slow. We ordered an omelet and egg rolls and it took thirty minutes for our food and we were the only two in the restaurant. And let's not talk about the mixed drinks. Will never go back.
1,"This was the only nail salon open on Sunday with decent reviews, and since I was starting a new job (and it was my birthday) I decided to make the 10 minute drive for some much needed pampering. \n\nI was promptly seated at a pedicure station with Jimmy (I like how they told me his name; it made the experience more personal). He brought me a cold bottle of water, a variety of magazines and showed me a detailed service list. And yes, the hot stone massage made ALL the difference for $3 extra. My pedi looks perfect. \n\nI had a basic manicure and Jimmy thoroughly shaped my nails, trimmed my cuticles, and painted flawless French tips. I accidentally chipped a nail before paying and they kindly fixed the smudge (I HATE it when a nail tech scoffs at me for my clumsiness and impatience).\n\nThe one thing I that bothered me was when I used the restroom....there were heaps of wash cloths and hand towels soaking in the sink, preventing anyone who used the bathroom from washing their hands. This got me thinking about sanitation...do they have a washing machine? Do they do this often? Do the nail techs thoroughly wash their hands? These thoughts I don't want to entering my head while getting a beauty service."
0,Food was good. Price ok. The hostess sent us to the 2nd floor. Don't go to the 2nd floor.\nFor the owner to have the servers go up and down those steep stairs like that is despicable. Even a great waiter would have problem providing good service under these conditions. The serving staff is composed of students. Hence the simplest of request for a breakfast place becomes a chore.
0,"This is the worst internet service that I have ever used.  I've lived in Korea and the service was 10x better.  My service is intermittent at best, constant outages, poor customer service and they charge $5 for their crap modem.  The only reason I'm with them is because of the DirecTV bundle.  Explore other options!"
0,"The fillet was excellent. My wife's salmon was overcooked, so we returned it.  The next salmon was cooked properly, although I make a better salmon on my grill than what we were served - it was average. Generally, when you send food back that was cooked improperly the restaurant will comp something, but that did not happen. The server also did not mention that to substitute asparagus for the potato is five dollars extra. Otherwise, the server was attentive and friendly. I mentioned to the manager on the way out our experience and instead of offering to make things right he said he wished he had been informed earlier. DC Steakhouse has prices that reflect upscale dining, but is not run to the standards of a fine dining establishment."
0,"Evidently shredding imitation crab is too much trouble for these guys because now they put the imitation crab in a food processor and grind it up until it's just nasty, mealy mush. The fish pieces weren't fresh either. \n\nI brought my daughter here at her request and spent $62 on all you can eat when there was nothing that I wanted to eat after tasting the first bite. The first thing I ordered was a California hand roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself. Her roll came as a cut roll, which I asked them to take back since she is 7 and doesn't eat a whole lot. My volcano roll which used to be the best roll they had, came out as nasty, disgusting, gritty mush with some rice and eel sauce thrown on top. I literally spit it out when I tasted it. I left the nasty mush on the plate and was secretly daring them to question me about it. I then ordered a mexican roll which used to be so tasty with shredded crab and shrimp in a spicy mayo with avocado. Ugh again there was the appalling crab/grit mush in it. After the crab fiasco I decided to start ordering Nigiri. The yellow-tail was simply unrecognizable. It looked nothing like yellow tail, yet when I questioned the sushi chef he assured me it was. Ick! I ordered cajun albacore and was able to enjoy it a little since the ponzu sauce drowned out the not-so-fresh fish taste. I should have turned around and walked out when I first entered the place and it smelled like fish. The icing on the cake to this dinner was when my daughter and I tried ordering Mochi to be told that we can only get 1 per person. Really??? I'm paying $62 for nasty sushi and I can only have 1 effin mochi? I refuse to ever return to this poor excuse for a sushi bar. Just the thought of that night makes me want to erp."

0,"took my wife and 3 kids for breakfast at dinner time. The employees were very nice and helpful but....my wife found a long hair in her eggs, they forgot to take the kids meals off the cost (kids eat free happy hour) I gave the waiter $10 for being so polite but then they charged my card twice. I then sat on hold for 10 minutes the following day to try to resolve. the manager said I would have to bring my bank statement in so she could send it to corporate and get it fixed. What a nightmare."

0,WTH! Low quality photographers who do not care if the background is set proper or not. They also lied. I wanted a full body pic in two different attires but took in just one of them and said he took in both the attires. The photographer also did not know how to take a full body pic. He took a pic which looks like he captured it from the sky rather than from the ground. Very disappointed.
1,"Check this place out! It's restaurant week and they have a great 3 course menu for $33!!!!!! I had lovely cauliflower soup, fabulous short ribs,and we tried every dessert on the menu.

I went for dinner after studying one night with some friends.\nThe waitress was polite but chronically forgetful, and had to be asked multiple times for anything from water to silverware to condiments.

0,"Had my radiator replaced there a few months ago. It almost seemed like they did it a little too fast, also the manager [overweight gentleman with a lisp don't remember his name] didn't seem to know what to charge me so I'm assuming I was overcharged. About 2 months goes by my car overheats on the freeway so I take it to a new mechanic and they informed me that when I had my radiator replaced they forgot to \""burp it\"" at the end which is \""mechanics 101\"".  I'm just glad no one was hurt when my car overheated I wouldn't recommend tire jerks to my worst enemy."
0,"Make sure you ask about the coupons before you order. I ordered a footlong specality sandwich and the cashier told me that my coupon was not eligble.

I will use the coupon next time but I will never visit this place again."

I'm from the east coast, home of the best Chinese food in the country, and I have not been able to find anything that measures up to even the worst of places back home until I found Iron Chef. It is the real deal. Quality delicious food. I've tried a number of the menu items and have no complaints. The pu pu platter is amazing as well as the service, no frills Chinese take out to die for. I might be a little to excited but it is only because of the utter lack of good Chinese food in the region. My one complaint is that the soda fountain kind of sucks."
1,"I've been here a number of times for lunch and dinner and have always had a fresh, interesting and tasty meal. I love 1) that their menu offers some healthier options, grilled items, healthier sauces, etc 2) that they take reservations and 3) that they are Byo. It's small and charming and has a ton more character than the walnut grill (or other similar options) down the street. It's not cheap, but you will enjoy yourself and be treated to a quality meal!"
1,"Was in town with 2 female coworkers and we decided to check out this club.  Since it was a last minute thing, and we weren't on any guestlist, we stood in line and waited forever.

Especially the fire and fountain by the circular dancefloor.\n\nMy 2 coworkers seem a little bored at the club, because it wasn't really playing their type of music, but I was super delighted because I am a TRANCE girl.  But boy... it's hard to dance to the music when you are trying to bounce to the beat in a tiny little skirt and 3 inch high heels.  Hahah...\n\nYup, I had a GREAT TIME at RAIN."

0,"Look here Buffalo Exchange:\n\nYou only accept ugly clothes.\n\n I have had so many friends bring their clothes here and they reject every single piece.

Give any kind of gesture to make up for their (seriously stupid) mistakes?\n\nMy friend had described 3 other instances like this, but I didn't really believe it until I saw it with my own eyes.\n\nThe way this was not managed gives me the feeling that the owners don't really care how the restaurant is being run, and that they are not that interested in customer service.\n\nEven though I like the food, I won't be coming back unless I really see some kind of effort to improve their management.\n\nThere are lots of other Thai places within a couple mile radius, and I will be patronizing them from now on."
1,"With as much as I eat here, I'm surprised I haven't given them a review. Whenever I feel like pizza I always order from here. I order online because I have a daughter who likes to yell and scream and it is just so much easier. The order time is always accurate, I LOVE the tracker, and the delivery men are also so nice and polite. I used to go to pizza hut, but after having tons and tons of problems with the pizza-cold, gross, and skimpy toppings; I convinced my husband to let me order dominos and we have never turned back... he just wishes they had a better deep dish crust- which i dont mind either way :)"
0,"Had a few bad experiences unfortunately in just one visit. The associates had no intention on being courteous, they even seemed to run away or roll their eyes to avoid me. I had to walk to the cashier to ask for help,  she willingly helped me,  answered my questions.  When I was about to walk out, the alarm went off and I was NOT even close to the door, one of the associates quickly pointed me out,  and loudly said \""Can you come here I gotta check if their is anything in THERE\""  meaning my bag.  He gave me his back the whole time, and didn't even look at me to say I was good to go. He just said your fine. That's it. So rude."
0,"My husband and I thought \""oh awesome! We love burgers!\"" but when we sat down to look at the menu there were only 5 burgers. Odd...since it's a BURGER bar. Oh well... we ordered the Caprese Flatbread and two BBQ burgers. The flatbread was a cold piece of focaccia with tasteless tomatoes and some bland mozzarella. Not impressed.\nThe burgers were good, messy but good. I was really disappointed that there were so few choices of burgers at this place. Their truffle fries were very good.\nThe staff...well they didn't seem to care that we were there.\n\nSadly we won't be back here. They had potential but for the money they won't get a second chance."
1,"I went to Daily Dose on a Saturday. There were plenty of empty tables inside, but my friend and I decided to wait for a table on the patio. The hostess was efficient seating us once a table became available. I had the veggie burger. I told the waitress I couldn't decide between sweet potato fries and regular fries. She suggested I get the combo, which is offered on the lunch menu, not the dinner menu. I thought that was nice of her, since I wouldn't have known about it otherwise. I can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu."
0,"Here are the simple facts and reason for the above review:\n\n1. The owner is opportunistic and take every attempt to profit at your expense.\n\n2. I am a repeat customer, and have spent $600+ in dry cleaning at their locations.\n\n3. Once, a $150 Facconable shirt was damaged in their folder, the owner offered to buy me a replacement (the shirt is discontinued) or a credit.  I told him the truth and stated I had gotten it at a heavy discount for $35, which he credited me for.  I could have been opportunistic as he is and produced a valid receipt for the original replacement value of the shirt as $150, but did not.  The owner also attempted to defer blame by stating the shirt had a defect, which it did not.\n\n4. Once, at the Tatum Blvd location I had my clothes in before 7AM, stated clearly to them: shirts folded and need be ready by 4PM to make my flight.  I stopped by, they stated they had a machine breakdown and apologized for not calling me.  The shirts came to me not folded and I just barely made my flight.  I tipped them $20 for their effort.\n\n5. Once, at the Thomas Rd location, they stated their machines broke down and half of my dry cleaning would not be ready.  I was forced to purchase clothing on the trip at a loss of over $80 to me.\n\n6. Today, Monday, I brought six pieces of laundry (shirts) and dry cleaning in to the Thomas Rd location at 645AM and requested the items by 3:30PM to 4PM same day service.  They stated their same day service is completed by 5PM and if I wanted my clothes by 3:30-4PM, I would have to pay a $5 per piece upcharge.  I explained that not only I am a repeat customer, I also travel through to Friday and need a dry cleaner that will either work on Saturday or do my cleaning earlier on a Monday.  The girl at the counter contacted the owner, explained my dilemma and the owner stood firm at the upcharge\n\nConclusion: If anyone reads this, I really need a decent dry cleaner in Phoenix that does work on weekends or is not a \""rip-off\"" or is at least fair to their customers, because this Cleaners really deserves only a single star for their poor customer loyalty and their opportunism."
0,"Went into Topshop today to return an outfit and I was told by Sara \""the manager\"" that my clothes were too worn. She arrived to the counter in a horrible mood and didn't even greet me with a hello or how are you or  even introduce herself as the manager. I worn them for maybe an hour and they were still in perfect condition. She then told me the extra buttons are missing but I don't know anyone that keeps the extra buttons on their outfits while they wear them. Just the week before I spent $500 on clothes there and I just needed to return one outfit but she said that she sees clothes everyday and mine are \""wrinkly\"" so u can't return them for me because they have a few wrinkles she said yes and that's it. She was so disrespectful and very demeaning. I said then maybe I'll try to go to a different Topshop facility so I can talk to someone with better customer service skills and she said good luck because I'm the manager and were the only Topshop in Vegas. This is apparently the only Topshop in Vegas so needless to say I won't be shopping there anymore. Sincerely, a used to be a loyal guest!"
0,This Taco Bell / KFC is famous for getting orders wrong and now they don't participate in D backs promo! Sure wouldn't want us seniors (whom are the majority of their business to get anything free!
1,Really nice place but I don't believe they serve anything other then poutine after a certain hour. Sad because I'm not a big cheese fan but a must visit place !
1,I had my hair done last night for the 2nd time by Damien and I'll I can say is WOW my hair has never looked so good!!\n\nI work awful hours but Damien takes me in for late appointments and takes his time with my hair.  I opted to go short last night which is something I haven't done in 10 years and I LOVE it.\n\nMy girlfriends haven't seen me yet but the guys in my office are falling all over themselves telling me how much they love my new style!\n\nDamian YOU ROCK :)
0,"Unbelievable.\n\nI wanted to change my flight to leave from a different city. They wanted to charge me $850 to change the flight. Even if i wanted to just cancel the front end of the round trip ticket they wanted to charge me $350.  I could buy a one way ticket for about $300 but they will cancel my return flight if i don't show up on the flight. I am trying to go into and out of Charlotta, that's what the airlines will do to you when they are the only game in town.\n\nI fly on average once every other week, you now know why US Air is on the bottom of my list of airlines to fly on."
1,PDQ is awesome! The food was great. We received out order very quickly and everything has hot and fresh. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The interior of the restaurant was clean and modern. Would definitely recommend this place and will be back next time I'm close by. Get a milkshake too...you won't regret it!
0,It happened to me too. No call no show. Very sad the situation she puts people in. Very sad that I had to show up to my own birthday with no dessert.
1,"Maize is good, but the hype has gotten out of hand. \nTheir burritos are average - I mean, they are above-average for this area, but in general they are just okay. Kind of loosely wrapped, which is disappointing.\nChips and salsa are good.\nTacos seem fairly standard.\nPerhaps the issue is that there is so much mediocre Mexican food around. I heard rave reviews about here, and have tried them a couple of times, but they are just good in my opinion. So, this is a local 4 (I'd rather have Huaraches) and if I'm judging it against legit Mexican in other areas of the country, it's probably a 3."
0,"The phrase, \""Let's not and say we didn't\"" comes to mind after staying here.  We had booked for two nights and only stayed for one.  We asked for two beds and when we arrived there was a single king.  They said it was never a guarantee and only a request, and said they could give us a roll away bed.  They said it would arrive in 15 minutes.. well, an hour later and it still hadn't arrived.  We went to dinner, gambled a bit, came back, and it still wasn't there.  When we called the front desk they said that the person that handles roll away went to lunch, and wouldn't be back for an hour.  So let's do the math.. we arrived at 5pm, went to dinner, came back to our room at 10pm, and at 11pm our roll away finally arrived.  Only took SIX hours, I call that SERVICE (bad service).  Not to mention the roll away bed sucked (no surprise there).\n\nWas there anything good?  Well... \n* You have to pay when you enter the parking structure ($5), and if you are a hotel guest you have to get reimbursed from the front desk later.. there was a very long front desk line.. by long, I mean.. is it worth the $5?  Big pain in the butt.\n* There was hardly any parking in the parking structure, we ended up going to the 4th floor just to find a parking spot, which wouldn't be so bad if the elevator didn't suck (see next bullet point).\n* The elevator in the parking structure is horrible.  It takes FOREVER.  After waiting FOREVER for the elevator to finally reach the 4th floor so we could take our luggage downstairs, it was FULL--probably with all the other people that waited FOREVER for the elevator.  We ended up hauling our luggage down the 4 flights, and lugging them back up the same flights because the elevators take.. FOREVER--you got it!\n* Toilet paper.  So, usually, there's extra TP in a bathroom.  Nope.  We had half a roll to start with, and that was it (really?).  We used it sparingly, since after the scenario with the roll away.\n* The regular king size bed was awful.  I couldn't sleep well, tossed and turned, and woke up with back soreness.\n* The noise from across the street is so loud that it actually permeates the room.  I was on the bed across from the window and it just boomed all night.  I'm not complaining that the music was thumping all night, I'm complaining that the stupid room isn't soundproofed enough so that I DON'T hear it.\n\nNeedless to say, we only stayed one night at the Plaza.  You are cheap, not very easy, and not worth it.  Pay the extra money and go to the strip.  The Monte Carlo was a dream compared to this place."
0,"Baffled at the ratings this place gets.  The ambiance is nice, and it would be a fun place to go with a group of friends for drinks and \""pre-gaming it\"" before going out.\n\nBut...\n\nMy family and I are rib lovers, and in no way shape or form did Bobby Q make the grade.  \n\nThe waiter touted them as smoking \""all of their meats\"" for over 18 hours.  I almost fell of the booth, because you smoke meat that long either it's going to get bitter from the amount of creosote building up, or at the very least it'd be overcooked (well, perhaps except for pulled pork).  Ribs can tolerate about 5 hours.  His hyperbole was obvious.  Perhaps some people get really excited when they hear this line, because it's supposed to sound impressive.    \n\nI ordered the St. Louis style spares, and parents ordered the baby backs.  All of the ribs were overcooked and mushy (\""falling off the bone\"").  The spares were actually better cooked than the babys, which isn't saying much.  Interestingly enough, the babys were very fatty, in fact my Dad was spitting out pieces of fat.  Spares were not as bad (go figure, given it's usually the other way around).  We are not \""fat shy\"" but this was really excessive.  The rack was not trimmed properly.\n\nThe ribs tasted smoked, although not an overly pronounced smoke ring.  Definitely not smoked 18 hours.\n\nPeople freak about the Mac & Cheese here, but it's really nothing special.  Creamy and they certainly use processed cheese (which isn't always bad), but nothing more.  I really liked the beans - not too sweet.\n\nIn short, I could see how the other offerings on the menu may be good, and given the ambience and service another experience with different food may give better ratings, but ya gotta do your ribs well if you are going to call yourself a BBQ restaurant.\n\nOnce again, the lack of good BBQ in Phoenix continues to amaze me.\n\nAs a side note, we had leftover ribs.  I came home with my parents and was about to take them in the house.  My parents said, \""you really aren't going to eat those, are you\""?  I said, \""probably not\"".  Into the trash they went."
0,"The 5 star review on here must be from a blood relative, because this is the biggest group of crooks I've experienced. I moved out of the house in spotless condition but was charged a ridiculous cleaning fee and a $400 re-listing fee... Even though they didn't need to re-list it because I found them the new tenants! \n\nComplete jerks when I confronted them about these charges. I'll never do business with these thieves again, and hopefully you'll steer clear too."
1,"I just moved to Las Vegas from San Jose, CA, and I have spent the past 6 months trying to find a good burrito. I'm talking soft flour tortilla, well seasoned juicy meat, rice, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole; with salsa on the side. I am excited to say I have finally found it! The staff is super friendly, and the carne asada.... hot off the grill and seasoned perfectly - reminds me of the bay area all the way :) \n\nThe one thing that throws you off about this place - it's located inside the convenience store of the Arco gas station on the corner of Rancho & Craig - I took a chance and was so glad that I did :)"
0,"Very unimpressed by my first and probably last visit to Chop last Saturday night. \n\nThe problems started with the hostess, nice enough, but clearly confused. I waited 45 minutes for a table that was empty when we arrived. The service was piecemeal and I wasn't really sure who our actual server was. The manager took our order and followed up when she could, she was nice enough to offer a larger table than the smaller one that we were initially seated. That effort was the highlight of our night. Others brought our food and the occasional drink refill. But my wife waited 20 minutes for a glass of red wine and was never asked if she wanted another. \n\nThe menu was uninspired. We started with a spinach dip and chips and an order of fried calamari. Neither very memorable. Each of us had burgers and fries. All the food came out quickly and was fine, but we left expecting something better. \n\nThe location and atmosphere are great, although from what we sampled of the menu and service, that's what Chop has going for it. All flash and very little substance. At least that was our experience on a moderately busy Saturday night."
1,"The Bizness Salad is the way to go! Curried Quinoa, Broccoli, and Brussels Sprouts all day! I love everything at Bronze Cafe."
0,"Dissatisfied. I heard such great things about this place and low and behold, the food was bland. The egg salad sandwich was eggs and mayo, with no taste at all. The tomato basil soup was horrible, and the \""garlic\"" hummus had less flavor than my glass of water. I would not recommend."
0,"02/14/11 LUNCH. New to the LV region. Had Mexican food in the Los Angeles area for 41 years, so I'm spoiled. Been to a few other mexican places before coming here, this is one of the first reviews I'll write about them. OK, today. Ordered cadillac margarita, which was OK but expensive. Chile relleno was OK. (Chapala's has better ones, IMO.) Good green chili chicken tamale, but not enough of the sauce. Overall, nothing special, and EXPENSIVE for the experience, especially for a lunch. PS I should mention, the wait staff, albeit a little overwhelmed by the crowd for Valentine's Day lunch, were VERY COURTEOUS and WONDERFUL to me. ALL very friendly and attentive."
1,The service here is usually very slow but the great food makes up for it.  Avoid the salad bar as it is nothing special. Pretty much anything on the menu is fantastic and worth the poor service.
1,I have a very old heat pump on the roof of my house and every summer and every winter I have to have someone come to fix it. I have a home warranty so I am at the mercy of whomever the warranty company sends out. This time they sent Superstition Cooling and was I ever thrilled! Craig identified the problem and fixed it right away. He was polite and professional and very efficient. I would HIGHLY recommend Superstition Cooling! Thank you for a great service call.
0,"I try not to go to Best Buy at all cost because I'm accustom to receive poor customer service when I go there.  Every now and then, I find myself going there because there simply isn't any other retailer who sells certain items.\n\nToday, for example, I ordered a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard online to pick-up in store.  The Website said that the item was in-stock at this local Best Buy.  I like using the pick-up in store option whenever possible because I like knowing ahead of time that they have the item and that it's waiting for me.\n\nI made my order first thing in the morning and never received a confirmation email.  Typically, you receive a confirmation email no more than 1 hour after you have placed and paid for your order online.  I decided to go to the store to find out that they had my item in the back but that I couldn't have it yet.  When I explained that I had plans this evening and that I wouldn't be able to pick-up my item later, they simply stated that there was nothing they could do.  I asked them why they couldn't just go in the back of house to grab my item that I had already paid for but they said they just couldn't do that.\n\nThis is frustrating for 2 reasons:  1.)  It shouldn't take that long to purchase something online to pick-up in store and 2.) I don't understand why someone can't simply go in the back to grab the item that I've already purchased.\n\nI think I would have been a little more forgiving if the customer service had been better and felt that the person I was speaking with had an ounce of empathy.  Then again, this is Best Buy.  What did I expect?"
1,fresh pandesal and lechon!!!!  one pound is more more than enough for 3 people. they also have crispy pata and chicharin bulaklak. both i'll try when i go back next week. so glad there's a place here in Chandler that could satisfy my craving for lechon at a very affordable price. $8.95 for a pound. \n\nI also got the fresh pandesal. it was light and fluffy but a bit too sweet for my taste.
1,"Just went for my oil change they had a deal running which was a 6,000 mile oil change for $29 which is very reasonable but they also let me use the check in deal with it so my total was only $20! Lets just say this is the cleanest car shop I have been in. They were all nice and they offer free wifi also they give you complementary water, coffee, tea and even ice cream! I am defiantly return."
0,My 4 friends and I were disappointed today when we drove over 10 miles to your sandwich shop on Fort Apache. We arrived @ 7:25pm and the shop was closed! The store hours say open until 8:00pm and there were at least 2 employees inside but no one would let us in. We ended up going across the street  to Arby's. Major bummer!
1,"The antithesis of Starbucks...independent coffee shop at its finest.  Bungalow with slacker types on Macs, board games, and dudes with dreadlocks on their fourth quadruple espresso latte for the day (and it is only 1:30 p.m.).  Americano was unbelievably smooth, made me swear off corporate coffee for almost a week (until I had no choice)."
1,"My wife and I went for dinner the other night and we loved the place.  We went on Thursday night because they had a guitar player with a great voice singing some old favorites that went well with a dinner setting.  The Scottish salmon ($20.95) was some of the best tasting salmon I've ever had.  The sauce on the side was different and very good.  The Farro salad we liked too, although it did seem pricey at $11.95.  The bread pudding was killer good ($7.95) and a large enough portion for two.  My wife thought the house Chardonnay was good for only $6.  The Lagunitis Pale Ale on draft ($5) was nice too.\n\nOur waitress was very nice, friendly, helpful, and attentive.  She couldn't have been better.\n\nOne of the owners came by to greet us and see how things were going.  She was very nice and friendly.  We enjoyed talking with her.\n\nThe interior of Twisted Rose if nicely decorated and it's comfortable.  The tables aren't crowded close together like many restaurants.  They have a nice patio area with some big plants to screen out the parking lot.\n\nOverall we like Twisted Rose and we will go back.  I hope you go too so this fine place will prosper and stay open."
0,"Holy Crap this place was packed and nasty.. air circulation was horrible.. felt so gross after came out this place. \n\nOnce again, need to deal with the whole vegas exclusive theme. Be there early or have connection or have lots of CASH!!!!\n\nI did not enjoy this place a bit. not sure will ever come back."
0,"I just moved to Madison from the Kansas City Area. The AMC Star theatre was my first cinema experience in Madison.\n\nI was excited, because in Kansas, our AMCs are palaces - equipped with a bar/lounge, Fork and Screens (dinner theatre), IMAX, a concession area with ice cream, pizzas, and the works, and fully updated theaters with high quality sound and picture, and clean seats. This AMC paled in comparison. It was uninviting, out of date, old carpet, shabby bathrooms, and low quality screens. I was very disappointed in the large difference between the two cinemas of the same chain.\n\nA few perks: yes it is large, had a good selection of films, and no line for tickets or concessions.\n\nWhat is most disturbing is that other reviews for this theatre say its the biggest and best in Madison. Excuse me? This is the best? This sorry, shabby, vacant theatre from the late 90s? Sure, it is big. But it is a big fixer upper.\n\nI'm not a huge priss about these things, don't get me wrong. I saw my movie and it was all fine enough. I guess I am just disappointed in the comparison, and the fact that this is the best the area has to offer."
0,What a joke. Indifferent and rude receptionists. Lazy artists. Go to a real tattoo shop and avoid this place. For drunk tourists only!!
1,"I love the Hummus from here! I do not like their food. I go quite often but,  to only eat the Hummus! Delicious!"
1,"This place is amazing! They close early so get there earlier! The donuts are amazing and selection is awesome (if you get there early enough). It's a hole in the wall kinda place and the lines usually leads outside but boy is it worth it. If you like donuts and haven't been here, shame on you. They are all cake type donuts and those clearly are the best. I have nothing but compliments for this place so let's just save each other some time I'll stop writing, you stop reading, just go there. Right now...... Why are you still reading?! GO!!"
1,"Love Shane Co! My fianc\u00e9 surprised me with the most beautiful ring from here and the diamond is absolutely gorgeous! The ring was a little loose, so we took it in (which is kind of far from us) and they were able to resize it and polish it all in one visit :) Over all, we've been very pleased with our experience at Shane Co!"
1,Best place we ate at during our trip. There were some good selections on the menu but I went with the angus burger. It had a crab slaw with shrimp and BBQ sauce on it. It sounded interesting and it tasted great! Everyone else was happy with their selections. Kid friendly. Their prices were reasonable with an affordable wine and beer list. Service was good. It took a few minutes to get started but the manager came by and spoke with our table. Making the rounds is always good to do.
0,"I have eaten here several times and for the most part, dinning in seems to be a solid 3 stars, maybe 4 if I'm feeling particularly generous. However, I will never be a customer here again, in any fashion. Why? Because of their utter failures in the take out department. 2 flippin times these clowns have ruined our night by butchering our take out order. I would call to express their liability for the screw up and no responseability was ever taken. Were it not for the decent dine in experiences  we have had, this would one star for sure."
1,"Grayhawk Golf Club is one of the best public golf experiences in the state. The staff could not be any more courteous to you as a first time or returning guest. I love that they offer two incredible 18-hole Championship golf courses, and also provide you with two separate driving ranges for warming up.\n\nThe course itself, even in the dead of summer, was immaculately groomed and was in top notch playing condition - a true beauty of a track. I highly recommend Grayhawk if you're in Scottsdale and you're looking for the real deal \""Arizona\"" golf experience."
1,"So I made another trip here during the 2009 CES, and it was just as fun as ever.  It was just as lively as before, and the band did an excellent job of making this place a fun and entertaining evening for us.  At some point in the night, the band announced that a very special guest would be coming in soon, but we had no idea what to expect... (more on that later)\n\nSo my friend and I ended up with the jagerschnitzel, which is a fried and breaded pork dish that also came with some spatzle (handmade German pasta).  Not as big as my meal last time I was here, but still very good.  The one thing that is cool is that instead of bringing bread to the table, they bring out a soft pretzel and several dipping sauces.  The pretzel was very good, and for me, just the regular mustard was good enough.  Our other friend got another dish that was all sausage, and that looked really good too.\n\nOur waitress was very fun, and came by to check up on us regularly, but not to a point that it got annoying.  She also noticed that my friend and I both had a bunch of cameras out, and told us that the \""special guest\"" was about to arrive, and we should rush the big double doors before anyone else got there.\n\nThe doors open, and it's none other than David Hasselhoff!  So he comes in with a camera crew, my friend and I are busy snapping up pictures, everyone is rushing the area he is walking, and he makes his way to the band area.  He talks a little, and then starts signing \""Freedom\"", and says that he is happy to be at the HOFFbrau haus.  \n\nIt was definitely an enjoyable evening, and I think we will start to make the Hoffbrau Haus as one of our CES traditions."
0,"This place really made me sad I had high hopes for this place I really did. I got the Roast pork which a lot of people seem to order. When it came out with the rice it was cold, the rice was warm but it was not its like it had been sitting out all day. We got there at 2 o'clock just after the lunch crowed should have gotten out. The crispy skin was nice but i was turned off by the smell of the place and how the food was cold."
1,All I have to say is Chicken Super Nachos and Steak and Egg breakfast burrito!!!!!!    PAPOW!!!
1,"This place is great! It is so quaint and homey, and that's one of the many reasons I love it.  They offer your traditional sushi rolls,  plus a few new and unique options.  Everything is fresh and delicious,  and I love that they use a light tempura batter.  Staff is SO nice,  and you can tell they genuinely care about their customers.  Can't wait to come back for their monthly sake tasting event."
1,"I like this place...I have to say living within a 3 minute drive is prolly a key factor in us liking this place but it has good food, decent prices, and the environment is chill, modern and slightly upscale (but I still had on jean shorts and a tank top when eating dinner there with my baby and husband)\n\nWe have had the pizzas, salads (chop was good!) and their desserts were also good.  Decent food and convenient for us as a family to dine at.  \n\nTIP to restaurant: get better high chairs please!!!"
0,"I don't know how many of you have ever dined and dashed. But that's exactly what happened to me and my boys on Christmas Eve. We went and saw the last showing of the night for Tron and bought the refillable popcorn and drinks. At about 9pm when we went back to get a popcorn refill we found that all the employees had left the counter and it was closed up, the movie ended around 10pm. I dined and the theatre employees dashed. I was ticked because I paid EXTRA for extra popcorn. \n\nI thought I would try this theatre, but will continue to patronizeTempe Marketplace or Desert Ridge the next time I want to see a movie. Goodbye Harkins on Mayo Blvd."
1,"After a few hours hanging out at the bar, I was in the mood for a Fatburger.  I ordered a Large Fatburger with Cheese.  The wait was the usual 15+ min....standard for Fatburger.

0,"So we traveled quite the distance to get to this place based on the recommendation of our concierge.  Lesson learned, never listen to his advice again.  Yes they have a very extensive breakfast menu, but its actually quite disturbing how quick the food comes out.  Within 5 mins, literally, we got our food.  Essentially it makes me think of a fancy diner with large vats of food in the back just waiting to be plated.  We had the asperge moi which was an omelette with swiss cheese and asparagus and an eggs benedict.  We also had the 2 eggs breakfast with poached eggs, bacon, beans, potatoes, fruit and toast.  Really nothing special and knowing that the food has been sitting back there for awhile and not freshly made is disturbing."
0,"I was glad our tickets for Cirque Elvis was comp by Aria because this show was horrible!\n\nThe Elvis theme was a great idea but it just didn't follow through and was less Cirque and more singing. I was surprised the Cirque performers were even singing, the show lacked creativity compared to the Beatles show, \""Love\"" at the Mirage. \n\nWhat I liked about it was when they showed the Elvis montage of his family, career and the final days if his life. My mom on the other hand loved the show but to me it was no bueno."

You could bring the whole family and have something for everyone, there's a playground, dog park, basketball court, etc. I went for a hike, and there are several excellent trails with excellent views of nature. If you're in the east Charlotte/ University area, this is a great place to spend a weekend afternoon. You could lose yourself in the woods and almost forget you're actually in a city, and I mean that in the absolute best way possible!"
0,"We had great service,good coffee nice atmosphere. The food is the reason for the two stars.The potatoes where tasteless no shredded just frozen chunks. The biscuits where hard, not homemade and the gravy was bland."
1,"When it comes to cars, I am a bit of a snob particularly with regards to maintenance and car. There's a slew of dealerships and shops so what always sells me is customer service and attention to detail. I took my car in for just a check-up and cannot tell you how phenomenal my experience was. I wouldn't think of going anywhere else and trust me, I drove the distance for this service. From the friendly lot attendant at the early hours of the morning to the jovial service adviser, I think their love for cars shows in their attitude and care of the customer. Greg and Phon went above and beyond; this is what customer delighting is about and others should take note. And while they tried to tempt me with a Q50 loaner, I would have just returned as a happy customer. I am a big fan!"
1,The ambience is good.  I ordered the John's steak and eggs for brunch.  It's delicious.
0,"The food is horrible, cold, and old. I have never tasted worse pizza. There is barley any food on the buffet line, and what little there is is not worth eating. Worse restaurant experience I have ever had."
0,"went to the bank for a friends bday. waited outside for an hour until some tourists next to us offered to pay a bribe to the bouncers to let us through the line or crowd. the bouncer asked for 20 bucks per guy. there were 5 guys so the dude ended up giving up 100bucks just to get us thru. then when we got the the main entrance they still were charging 30 bucks per person even though 100buck were just dropped as bribe money. they treated us like shit and told us to leave or else they would have to escort us out. worst experience at a club. those bouncers and everyone at the door make a lot of money just on bribes we saw it happen for a whole hour before they let us through. there were tons of cash \""handshakes\"". maybe that's why its called the bank because people end up leaving all their money there. never again!"
0,"Tried this for Thanksgiving dinner.\nServer got order completely wrong, dinner was rushed. Food just okay.\nCompletely and thoroughly disappointed."
1,"Today is my second time to come here. We  ordered dinner size pineapple fried rice and red curry with regular tofu, asking for median spicy. The dishes taste very fresh, fried rice is not greasy, curry is light sweet which is perfect for me. We two girls finished both of them, too full!\nPlus I like the interior design of this place, even the restroom is nice too.  \nLast time I tried the pad see ew here, which is good too. But I like the red curry more."
1,"What a fun and cute little place! For $20 you can get a prefixed menu of sweets! You get a sorbet, a main dessert dish and a small vanilla or chocolate pastry. For $7 extra you can get a wine paring with your main dessert. The desserts are pretty good but the best part of it it's the amount of detail that they have. So many ingredients and decorations that makes this place very unique. The only bad part is that it could take a long time to get your dishes. I went with two of my girlfriends and we all ordered at the same time, but got the dishes at different times.... each five minutes after the other. They did not coordinate and bring all the dishes at the same time, which was very inconvenient! If you are a sucker for warm \""lava\"" you must get the red rock! Instead of warm chocolate it's a soft cake filled with strawberry! It was delicious!! The Mt Fuji was also very good, but you should only get it if you like chocolate and tons of frosting! We also tried the carib which is perfect for someone who is not that into sweets and prefers a refreshing dessert!  Overall, a must try at least once in your lifetime!"
1,"The Tru Vape folks are very friendly and helpful.  I came in without knowing anything about Vape, Ray patiently explained it in details and offered to try out several flavors. My favorite was the passion fruit.  I would recommend this place to fulfill your Vape needs."
0,"Really? What exactly are they famous for??\n\nAfter living in Glendale for about 5 years, seeing people drive around with Pete's bumper stickers, and detouring around 55th and Glendale at rush hour because the drive-through line backs up into the road, we finally tried this. In the end I just have to ask what all of their \""fans\"" are thinking.\n\nThe fish that's so famous looks and tastes like something you might get from the frozen food section of the store. But only if you got the cheapest store brand possible and made sure it was a SQUARE patty of frozen breaded fish. The fish sandwich was one of the aforementioned fish patties on a cheapo hamburger bun with a smear of sauce. The fries were questionable. Honestly, I'd rather eat fish at Long John Silver's than eat here again."
1,"I've been to two of the three Stingray locations in Arizona. Have to say - their sushi = good quality, nice decor and while not a comprehensive sushi variety, had plenty for me to choose from. I've been to a couple sushi places in this Scottsdale area (sushi brokers and RA Sushi) and Stingray definitely is way better. Good quality AND quality, especially for their happy hour menu. Would definitely come back again."
1,"A very popular brewpub.\n\nDon't make the unfortunate mistake of standing around by the bar. There's table service and they expect you to order from there. I'm unsure of what occurs when there are no tables and you'd like to stand by the bar.\n\nOur waiter extremely kind and helpful.\n\nAs for beers, I recommend their imperial coffee stout, Peche Mortel, and their American IPA, Moralite. Otherwise, I've found their other hoppy options to be a bit lacking."
0,"It's September 26, 2014 and still no resolution. Glad that my fingers still work and that I can do their work myself. DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS COMPANY!"
1,What a great show!! If you like the 80's you will love this show. We were front and center and loved every minute of it!! I will go again with friends!!
0,"Had the crab cakes. .  Mistake. .  Dry,  not much flavor. . Worse,  the rice and plantains were baked to the point that it was a dry lump with burned wood flavor"
0,"We ordered 2 dishes - one came warm, the other came cold. The rice also came cold. We told the waitress and she took the food back, only to return with both luke warm.  The manager stood on a chair to put candles on the wall, but never wiped it off. Everything was overpriced. Any other restaurant would be half the price. Nice people, but very unprofessional. No, I will not return."
0,"Whoa. Time has passed and this place has definitely not gotten any better. Honestly, it has definitely gotten more ghetto. I had an event that required me to stay at this hotel. So to put it bluntly, it was not my first choice to stay here.\n\nSo let's start out with the good things...\n\nThe price would have to be the best thing it has to offer. $30/night.  Secondly, the bed was pretty good we had one of the upgraded rooms in the North Tower. The gym was decent. We got the resort package which was $40 a day. It seemed like it was worth it if you like unlimited beer/wine/cookies. It also included the gym/spa. They had a coffee machine which was broken and only had drip. So no cappucino/lattes. If you have an event at the convention center, this hotel is extremely convenient. I suppose this hotel would be good for you if you are one of those people that are always late. The monorail is next to the hotel. And that's about it for me with the good things...\n\nNow to my things that I didn't like. When you have ghetto prices you get ghetto people. Go figure. The pool was filled with kids. I am not a kid. \nYou know, its the details that make or break these hotels. The plasma TV was nice. BUT NO HDTV???? FUCK. FURTHERMORE THESE ASSHOLES BLOCK THE INPUT IN THE TV!! So, you can't connect your ipod/media player to watch your stuff. FUCK. I hated that the default setting on the TV stretched the 4:3 to 16:9 weirdly. These assholes have the balls to charge $13 per day per laptop for Internet. WTF? Thank GOD I have my wifi hotsopt. \n\nThe lighting in the room was dim because they are stingy with the lighting. They have those compact florescent light bulbs. They are sooo ghetto that the light bulbs aren't even covered to look normal bulbs. The a/c in the room was obscenely loud. I called them to fix it and the guy shows up an hour later. I forgot that I called him! I hated the shower because I was taller than the shower head and I am 5'11\"". I further despised the shower because it was dark in the shower because these tight asses didn't put a light in the shower area.\n\nThey give you a bunch of coupons, but with restrictions. I got excited when I first got a drink coupon but it had restrictions: no Grey goose, no name brand drinks. Jeez. It was also good for beer/wine. This place is in need of some major makeover. The Benihana looks like when they first built the hotel 30+ years ago. Seriously though, if you have to go to Las Vegas on the cheap, you should wait longer save some more money get yourself a nicer hotel elsewhere."
1,I really enjoyed the tapas here. We asked the chef to bring out his favorites as to not miss anything. What a great choice. It didn't disappoint. We also tried ALL of the desserts. We literally tasted the menu.
1,"I've had less than 10 proper massages in my life.  That number will likely go up by a lot now that they're charging the ridiculously low rate of $22 an hour.  Wild!!  That's almost Thailand cheap!  Not really but still damn cheap!  I've always wanted one of those crazy Japanese massage chairs but I can live with this rate.  \n\nI had the same masseuse both times (I didn't catch her name) and tough love was the best description of my experience.  John Mellencamp's \""Hurts So Good\"" isn't the ideal song to have stuck in your head at a spa but there's no denying it!  I felt sorry for the other patrons for my laughing during the foot massage part.  Nothing I can do.  One thing that's undeniable are the results.  I feel great after leaving there.  Those first few steps out into the parking lot and breathing in fresh air is awesome.  \n\nSome tips:\n\n- Arrive wearing shorts, t-shirt and flip flops if possible.  I showed up in jeans and a dress shirt the first time because I had somewhere to be after but it was WAY more comfortable the second go around.  \n\n- The makeshift rooms in the back are better than the front room.  It's more dimly lit and less noisy so I would request that.  \n\n- It's better to call and make an appointment."
1,"When we asked some local Mexican friends where to go for authentic Mexican food and, in particular, mole, they unanimously recommended Pepe's.  Howard Seftel's AZ Republic review also recommended the chicken enchiladas with mole.\n\nWe went for lunch on a Sunday and fortunately did not witness any \""deals\"" going down.  The restaurant's in a stand-alone building with ample parking.  It's spacious inside with high-backed wooden booths and a long bar.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole:  3 flour tortillas wrapped around shredded chicken breast, covered with black mole and cheese, served with refried beans and rice\n - Tacos Rancheros:  mildly spicy slow-braised pork in choice of soft or crispy taco\n\nThe verdict:\n- The mole sauce was a delicious combination of spices and chocolate - we wished there could've been more.  I actually prefer dark meat so next time I'll order the Mole Poblano, where they give you choice of chicken leg or breast.  \n- Described as a house specialty, the pork was tender and infused with spices.  According to a review posted on the wall, chopped chorizo is also mixed in. \n\nDishes on average run between $8 to $10.\n\nWe're eager to go back to try the green corn tamales, taco monterrey (machado (sun-dried beef) w/ scrambled eggs) and of course, more mole!"
0,"I have mixed feelings about this Trat. \n\nVisiting Las Vegas last week, we wanted an intimate dinner before seeing The Phantom at the Venetian, and the Trattoria Reggiano is only a moment's walk from the theater. In light of the other reviews here, it seemed an inspired choice. It was less than that. \n\nOn arrival, on a not-terribly-busy Thursday evening after the theater - about 9 PM - it looked terribly inviting: Tables in the walkway as if a true Italian trat, and a few booths and tables inside near the open kitchen. Charming. We asked the Maitre' d for a booth (it helps my hearing, which is very poor), and were told we would not have it, and were shown to a table inside by the wall. OK, but a disappointment, even though it saved me $10 top to the Maitre' d, who seemed oblivious.  \n\nDelicious bread, with decent oil and vinegar, rapidly arrived, as did our waiter, who I asked for a recommendation between the spaghetti with meatballs (\""filet mignon\"") and the linquine bolognese. \""Eh!\"" He said. \""It's the same sauce, just not in a meatball.\""  Ummmm. The staff says the food is the same?  Disquieting. \n\nMy pasta and my wife's Ziti arrived almost immediately, as we were still on our first piece of bread. Good service is not the same as fast service; this isn't Pasta Now, but a relaxing meal. Still, it was hot and freshly prepared. The Bolognese was tasty, and (as usual) I ate half, expecting to take it back to our room for lunch the next day. My wife, who eats like a bird, ate about a quarter of her Ziti, and as the second waiter came to remove our dishes, I said, \""It was delicious, but we want to take it with us.\"" He nodded and left.\n\n A few moments later, our waiter returned with a check - strangely, for an Italian restaurant, without asking if we wanted dessert - and I asked, \""Where is our food.\"" I got blank looks; the second waiter said, \""Thrown out.\""  Argument follows. Finally, the headwaiter said, \""Wait. We'll recook for you.\"" This time, it takes longer, but when the bag returns, there are two tins inside; I look in the top one, and find bread. \""Where is my linguine?\"" I ask. Blank looks all over again. More argument. Finally, another recook, we take the food, and leave. \n\nThe service is obviously challenging, perhaps due in part to there being several languages and accents going on among the staff. The food was good, but not great; the meat sauce lacked seasoning (garlic is not all there is in this world). The Ziti was nice, but as it sat on the table, the cheese started changing from gentle yellow to bright orange. \""Cheese powder, perhaps?\"" said my wife. But it was good, albeit a bit incandescent in appearance.  The ambiance was very good, with a slight hint of New York Italian as a result of the dark stained booths. \n\nOverall, better than the food court next door, but not the place for the intimate and relaxing after-theater supper that many might wish."
1,"besides my awesome stay at the wynn where i was spoiled rotten..the palazzo is by far my FAVORITE hotel in all of vegas. even better than the venetian because the rooms are closer to the casino and to the strip...meaning less walking. ive stayed here about 4 times and loved it every single time.\n\nfor the money you pay, you wont get a bigger room anywhere else.. its not even a room. its a suite! thats really the best part about this hotel.. all of the rooms are suites.. meaning you get your 2 double beds.. or 1 king bed. a sunken living room, a pullout couch, and tv's everywhere!\n\nthis is the BEST and only place i would recommend to people if you have over 5 people in your group because one suite here can really accommodate a bigger sized party..with 2 queen beds, a pullout, and a sofa.. you could comfortably fit 7-8 people no problem... and its a great location if you party at either tao, xs, or any of the clubs on far end of the strip."
0,Woman was unbelievably rude to my friend and I. I asked for a chocolate covered strawberry and she practically snarled at us that they were $9 without making any move to pick one up for us. My friend and I are young but we still deserve to be treated as customers! I will not be returning to this location.
1,Went tonight and had a great dinner. Delicious pizza with 4 cheese and salami. The place is very inviting and service was attentive and personable. The tiramisu was one of the best I ever had. Be back soon!
0,Now that their new inspection results have been published I understand why I get sick all the time.\n\nI'm going to avoid this place like the plague.
1,"Great Pizza and Salads. Went here a few weeks ago for girls dinner and had a great time. Would highly suggest it. Also have visited the one in Old Town and great time and food there as well. \n\nTried to heat up the pizza the next day, since I had tons of leftovers and it was disgusting lol not sure what happened.. but good the day of :)"
1,"The Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak was part of a fab Travelocity package deal a couple years ago. This was my first trip to PHX and I was excited to see the area. \n\nMy sister came with me, and the deal included one of their suites with comfy double beds, a balcony shaded by huge palms and overlooking a beautiful courtyard, and a nice size bathroom. We thoroughly loved the accommodations! \n\nThe property includes a nice restaurant which we visited once or twice, several pools, a lazy river, super slide, pool volleyball, mini golf, and a couple cool souvenir stores with local items. We were blown away by the pool-side service, and the swim-up bar. We also availed ourselves of the Tocasierra Spa (see separate review) on the property. \n\nI would absolutely stay here again, but with a \""package\"" deal price."
1,"I had some sushi. I had some sake. I had something with black truffle. Oh yeah, I had some seaweed salad too. Let me tell you, everything was delicious. That's all."
0,"I know these guys have a strong, dedicated following.  But I've tried it a few times and I strongly feel that their food is tasteless and makes you feel endlessly bloated.  Service and atmosphere are equally mundane.  The best thing about this place is the salsa bar.  But it is often messy and depleted."
1,"My kids and I enjoyed it there .my 1 year and 3 year old had so much fun on the little kid side . There's 3 big trampoline for them you can't jump with them and that's fine. The place didn't smell like I though it would,great price for the little ones."
0,"Didn't meet my expectations. When I go to a resort, I anticipate excellent customer service and something more than a typical hotel stay. The rooms were good size and clean, but my room was not serviced on my second day stay and I certainly did not feel catered to while at the pool. Bartender by the pool was rude. Breakfast is also not included or even offered so you must go offsite for breakfast."
0,"Being an Italian from the East Coast I am disappointed on a regular basis when it comes to the pizza choices here.  I have found a few acceptable places with some decent pizza, however this is definitely not one of them.  I've had frozen pizza better than this.  took well over an hour for delivery, showed up barely warm, undercooked, and should have came with a missing toppings sign because they were no where to be found."
1,"THEIR BREAD IS FRESH ! ! ! \n\n They don't just make 1 batch a day, in fact, they make a different batch every few hours!  They are a sister restaurant to Hue Thai so if you noticed looking in the kitchen through the door you can see them actually making the bread =)   \n\nI'm very very very picky & selective with Vietnamese food (because I'm Vietnamese, I don't like eating my own food as strange as that sounds).  Thank god that Las Vegas does have 2-3 very good Vietnamese-Asian restaurants and MR. S is one of them!  As far as sandwiches, Mr. S is the BEST!  I live in Los Angeles and so I eat at Banh Mi Cali sometimes and have a hard time eating more than a few bites just because I don't like the breading is too hard and the meat is so-so but Mr. Sandwich's bread is always good and the meat is unforgettable!! (I had the Banh Mi Xiu Mai and was like \""WTH! THIS IS SO FREAKEN GOOD!)  \n\nIf you like varieties you'll definitely love how they have so many different meat and stuffings to choose from!  YUMMM for their MILK COFFEE!! My favorite place to get drinks!  They have BOBA tea too!\n\nSERVICE IS ALWAYS EXCELLENT!!! Sometimes holidays they take long to deliver though =/  It gets sooo busy in there that you have to wait about 5 min but I rather wait for good food than them hurrying up and messing it up.  1 of the girl that works the cashier is super cute and the other girl is quiet but nice.  1 time there was this mean lady but I think she got fired after the 2nd day of work ahahah!!  \n\nI like how it looks very warm in there with flat screen t.v. and nice interior decorations."
0,"This had all the elements to be a decent experience, the space is great but I went there for coffee and that's where they failed. Once again I requested and paid for extra shots of expresso only to be shorted and the zembala or whatever I ordered was supposed to have orange, cinnimon and spice and instead of any hint of citris it was chunky with cinnamon, seriously chunky, weak and unpleasant. So disappointing :("
1,"My friend and I come every now and then (only on Fridays) for their Friday soup (claw chowder). You can do pick 2 for a sandwich and soup combo (what I do). \n\nPlace your order, get a number, and find a table. You'll be brought your food.\n\nHaven't had any issues with service nor food quality. They also have a claw chowder bread bowl (reminds me of Disneyland, hehe) so definitely try that out. \n\nWill be back on a Friday again soon :D."
1,"Had a small Italian hoagie and 4 cut pie. \nPrice was good, food was ready in no time. I was looking forward to hearing from Mark (the guy I was warned about) but apparently it was past his bedtime. The pizza was what you would expect. Four cuts half pepperoni half extra cheese. The hoagie I asked for well done with what it normally comes with. From what I understand Mark makes the dressing himself.  It's pretty good. Service was the nicest part of Paisano's very friendly and helpful!"
0,"I first of all found it odd that a place would open up called Twin Peaks when there is a 4 Peaks around the corner.  A bunch of us decided to give it a try for happy hour & it was ehhh at best.   Visually inside it is nice with the cabin feel and young girls in next to nothing. But the bartenders were weak, food was nothing to go back for and it felt like a JV team at best. But also taking in to consideration it did just open and the girls are not hired based on performance. \n\nThe only thing it did have going for it was the people watching.  With a ratio of 1 girl to every 5 middle aged dbag it made for good entertainment."
0,"While it's great sushi, the staff is awful unable to resolve issues with an order, eventually ignoring our calls. Our order arrived with one roll missing, not for the first time. They agreed to deliver the missing roll and it never arrived. Make sure to double check your order upon delivery."
1,I can't say enough good things about Riccio's. I love it!!! I have been going there since I was a kid and nothing changes so delicious and never disappoints! Hidden gem!
0,"i hardly write bad reviews.  just not my style i guess... but i just cannot get over our experience at raffles cafe.\n\nfive of us went down to raffles for breakfast friday morning.  the restaurant was not busy, so tell me... why did breakfast take an hour and 45 minutes?\n\ntime it took to get seated (and awkwardly shuffled around to different waiting areas by the hostess): 10 minutes.\n\ntime it took for us to get acknowledged by someone: 15 minutes.\n\ntime it took for that someone to get our waters: 10 minutes.\n\ntime it took for our actual server to come and take our orders after we got our waters: 10 minutes.\n\ntime it took for our food - all breakfast... EGGS, for god's sake - to come after we ordered: 45 minutes.  45 f-ing minutes!\n\ntime it took for us to eat of our mediocre, lukewarm, barely a step above denny's food:  5 minutes.  we were starving.  yet, that didnt make the food taste any better.\n\ntime it took for us to get our bill: 10 minutes.\n\n= 1 hour, 45 minutes.\n\nridiculous."
1,"Love this place! Been looking for a new spot to eat healthy at and I found it. Ir had the create your own with chicken, brown rice, broccoli ad get the lemon vinaigrette dressing and put it all over everything. Love that dressing, seriously wish they would bottle it and let me take it home! I've also had the veggie pizza and chef salad here too which are both really good and light. All in all this place is phenomenal and all the staff are really nice!"
0,"One of the worst dining experiences I have had in Las Vegas in recent memory.  We walked in and no one greeted us at the door.  Finally a gentleman who had walked by us before asked if we were looking for a table.  Finally we were seated.  We were taken to a table where there was a wine bucket with an empty bottle of wine next to it, which was moved away.  We sat down and the server proceeded to tell us about the items that were not available.  It was still early on a Friday and they were out of many high cost items including steak and clams.  We decided to order a glass of wine to start.  It seemed as if they were short staffed.  So everything took a very long time.  We ordered 2 glasses of wine and an order of bruschetta.  The server returned later with a bottle of wine and informed my husband that they were out of the wine he ordered as well and would he like to have a glass from the bottle she brought over.  Finally,  we got our bar order.  We had been seated for a while.  No bread came.  Then finally about 15 minutes later we were brought a mediocre loaf of white bread. (nothing special).  I went to use my bread plate but it was dirty, it looked clean but felt like it had a dirty film over it.  The bruschetta was finally delivered and it was nothing to get excited over.  The bread was not toasted and it was just chopped tomatoes and garlic on untoasted bread. \n  In the meantime there was a musician who was playing in the dining room.  He sang Billy Joel, Cat Stevens songs kind of your typical lounge songs.  I enjoyed listening to him.  It seemed as if most of the people there were coming to listen to his performance.  A party of 3 people came in to listen to him but 5 more joined them and they needed a bigger table.  They wanted to put 2 tables together but the waitress kept saying that someone would move their tables for them.  Finally, the manager? came over and moved the two tables for them inches away from our table.  We were literally an inch away from 2 people at the table yet there was plenty of room that they could have moved them to the other direction.   At this point my husband picked up our table and moved it out of the way.  No one really seemed to care or notice that we had moved ourselves. \nAt this point we decided to cut our losses and leave.  No service, no food, no clue!  We went in looking for a casual dinner out and left angry and frustrated.  Don't waste your money!"
0,"So disappointed. I have eaten Grimaldi's a few times and it has been amazing. I just usually avoid it because I feel it is too expensive. So today (New years) my favorite pizza place was closed so I decided to call Grimaldi's since it is only a mile away from my house. The pizza was done quite fast, however, it look completely disgusting. The cheese looked like it was like wannabe feta. Idk what was going on. The pizza literally was tasteless and I wasn't going to smother it with Parmesan cheese and crushes red peppers for taste. I most likely will not come back. Shame shame shame."
1,"This place is great. The food is good, the prices are excellent, and the staff tries hard.\n\nI am deducting one star because 3 out of the last 4 times I've gone there, I get a new waiter that does not know anything about the food.  They're happy to help out when they figure it out, though...\n\nI will definitely return"
1,Had a lovely lunch with my friend. The Scallop roll is to die for! sushiwa is one of my favorite places to lunch in Newer henderson....it is so relaxing and the staff is friendly. The Sushi chefs are absolutely adorable!
1,"My new favorite take out place.  Friendly staff, good, fresh and delicious food"
1,"The yuzu sauces are to die for! Best salad dressing ever - I wanted to drink it from the bowl. Fish was grilled perfectly, chicken terriyaki was delicious, and tempura was yum. The ice cream was a perfect ending - and the yuzu flavor was so refreshing and a little tangy. Service was good too.  We will definitely be back!"
0,"The last 3 or so times I've visited, they've been closed 15 minutes early.\n\nOn the plus side, I've discovered I look damn good with longer hair."
1,"Spacious and big\n\nThe employees are kind and helpful if you need anything \n\nI didn't try the food but people did not seem to think it was bad. \n\nThe pools are about 4 ft deep which was nice but are medium size. \n\nThey could use a little cleaning inside the showers but for the most part it was clean. \n\nEveryone is pretty respectful and quiet. \n\nWish it was 24hrs, save money by not going to a hotel"
0,"We were on the guest list, so that was the only reason I didn't give this place 1 star.\n\nMostly reserved tables for bottle service. That's how they make their money. A tiny dance floor.  Go Go dancers on raised platforms pole dancing were entertaining.  Another room of the club played older hip hop songs, which I preferred to dance to.\n\nWe left after an hour or so.  When we were walking out, they blocked the entrance because somebody special was entering. A group of people paraded behind these pretty girls who were holding light saber-thingys. It was almost cult-like. Or like when boxers enter the ring and they make a big production. Lame.  Didn't even recognize who they were."
0,"Normally LOVE Penn Station, but today was. Greeted by a gnat infestation @ my Penn Station. Sooo troubled by that! Please get rid of the gnats. I will be back at least once, but if I have to fight the gnats for a lid & straw it will definitely be my last time. Totally willing to edit my review it fixed. I informed the guy behind the counter who was already aware and shared his knowledge of the gnat's resilience. I'm sure your not the first eatery to have to deal with this. Get a professional in there and save my favorite sandwich shop!"
1,"This is my favorite market in Las Vegas. Great produce section and a ton of specialty items I cannot find anywhere else. It is family owned and they have a ton of different departments such as (deli, seafood, butcher, sushi, meals to go, pizzeria, coffee, bakery, etc. etc. etc). The only downside is that some of their frozen items and non-perishables are a little more expensive, but I just don't get certain items there, for the rest of my grocery shopping and quality is made up in all the other places. Huge isles and a friendly staff... this is not your typical \""chain\"" market. A plus is that they have request tickets for customers to order specific items, brands, etc and they will stock it for you... Oh, also, their homemade sausage section and various prepared meals are darn good."
0,"Crowded, mashups, girls all wearing the same clothes, horrible booze (like poison-you horrible), $12 drinks, $450 bottles. Not my scene but the club was pretty/well appointed. Many floors. Might be someone else's idea of a fun night, but it definitely wasn't mine."
0,"So sick of going back to the Henderson, NV location.. Everytime we go service is AWFUL.. Tonight we went at 3:30 thinking service wouldn't be as bad and they seated us in the bar area (hehem with our 18 yr old daughter) and I ordered salmon, my husband ordered, pizza, and my daughter got an appetizer.. I actually walked out because my salmon took until 5:00 for some reason and the waiter was so dumb he said our order was taking longer because of the salmon.. How stupid is he to offend a customer, really?  I wouldn't have cared so much had not ALL of the booths around us filled up and they were all leaving or having dessert when our food finally came and the table in front of us had all steaks!  When he used the salmon excuse I told him it was easier than steak and he ran off like a baby and I wasn't even loud.. So weird.. Not going back to this B.J.'s and always ask myself if these people interviewed for a job being as negligent as they are as waiters.. Oh, to defend this place I could tell his co-workers were thinking, \""Oh God, he sucks.. \"""

0,"If you want to bank with a financial institution that have staffs that actually know what they are doing, don't come here!  They may have good intentions and want to protect their customers from fraud, but they also happened to be grossly incompetent or under trained to the point they can't even setup accounts they are recommending.\n\nCame in on three separate occasions to resolve this issue with their 'free' checking and savings account for making small debit and web purchases, but they can't setup the account correctly because the new accounts were never linked to the primary checking/savings accounts.  How I was able to setup monthly recurring transfers with the new accounts, I will never know.  To add insult to injuries, I never even received the card that I was supposed to use for said small purchases, while protecting the primary accounts. The first card probably got lost in the mail, as I moved shortly after and it probably didn't get forwarded to the new address.  The second one, I can't explain.  Maybe I should have made arrangements to physically pick it up from the branch, as they can't stuff envelops and mail it after forcing everyone to go paperless.\n\nAnyway, the staff are pleasant enough but have limited ability to refund monthly fees that were charged, except the immediate 3 months that they can view on their screen.  And after a lot of investigation and tracing the problem to issues linking these new checking and savings account to my primary ones, they said it was ultimately my responsibility for not monitoring my accounts. Never mind that they screwed up in the first place, or the fact that I have no access to it and no reason to monitor it.  Hell, I doubt some thief can fraudulently access the $200 ($162 after WF took their cut) in the account, if I can't even get to it.  And if they can, then hell they deserve it.  Escalated this to their new branch manager,and she also was unable to do anything, after promising to look into it.\n\nWorst customer service ever.  I am so pissed that I am going to close the accounts, take everything out as cash and stuff it under the mattress.  At least the balance will not mysteriously disappeared or result in a -18% return in under a year. If I want to see that kind of return, I can just buy bank stocks."
1,"I'd been craving BBQ since I knew the Carnie Crew was gearing up for a field trip, and the last place I would've guessed that had it was Vegas.  Technically, this is Henderson, but it's about 10 min east of the airport.  \n\nLocated in what seems like a fairly new outdoor shopping area, Lucille's is huge and service is absolutely top notch.  The portions looked huge, so come with an appetite.\n\nI ordered a bowl of the gumbo, which had a nice, smoky roux.  The roux is usually the tell-tale sign of a good gumbo, and while it was not down-home, hole in the wall NOLA good, it was unexpectedly great.  I enjoyed it and found the ratio of shrimp, chicken and sausage to be more than adequate.  The gumbo is served over a bed of rice, so it's almost a meal in itself.  For a Yelper, though?  BRING MORE FOOD!  So, with that, I ordered the Tri Tip Plate from the kids menu, which comes with a side of fries and mac & cheese.  I stuck with the meat, which was tender, moist, and nicely smoked.  \n\nGreat place for two or groups and parking wasn't too bad."
1,"My friends thought it was odd when I told them the highlight of my vacation was a cappuccino I had in Scottsdale.  We visited in December and were staying nearby at the Westin Kierland and were just walking the mall. Stopped in for a coffee as it was pretty chilly that night.  The barista was super nice and eager to share his passion for coffee. We were interested in just picking up a half a pound of beans.  I wouldn't expect great help from such a small sale but he had several recommendations and had us smelling all sorts of roasts before we settled on the one we wanted.\n\nI ordered a cappuccino which was probably the best ever, and I'm a pretty avid coffee drinker and try to visit some well known coffee places when I travel. They showed us some of the tricks to doing latte art, which I've since been unable to duplicate on my home machine - we'll chalk it up to not enough frothing power, not operator error :)."
1,Absolutely the best sushi I have ever had!
0,"Your standard Irish Pub, this place will not disappoint.  It's got the ambiance and atmosphere of a good Old Irish Pub.  A decent bar menu and beer selection add to this place.  \n\nThe location is a bit out of the way and the service can be wanting.  If you want a better Irish pub, hit the capital and head to the Brocach."
0,"In summary: Overpriced and not very good. A small cup of lentil soup that was very watered down was $4.50 ... the main dish \""tabouleh\"" salad was overly doused with vinegar and 90% parsley with some diced tomatoes - no bulgur ... I have never seen such a receipe. I left hungry. Service was a bit slow. We won't be going back there - there are too many nicer restaurants around to waste ones time and money on this place."
1,"We had planned on going to the Rhythm Room, which is directly across the street, but they were still charging a full cover at midnight, and just wanting to have a late-night cocktail, we took our hard-earned cash to Friends.  Just as we walked in, a drag show was ending, which was a treat.  Only wishing we had gotten there sooner, we sat down and ordered drinks.  I was amazed at the selection of flavored vodkas and other booze they have.  Not feeling too adventurous in that area I ordered a Ketel One Citroen on the rocks.  Generously poured, I don't remember the price, but I am sure it wasn't too steep.  As the night went on the place thinned out, and soon the wife and I were the only two people in the place.  The bartender, Anthony, was a joy to talk to.  We ended up just hanging with him until it was time to go.  I would go back just to have a bartender that good. Hell, the place is called Friends, and I'd be his friend any day. He was full of conversation and laughs.  At the end of the night, he called us a cab and made sure I didn't leave anything behind in my Ketel One haze.  He nearly had to come out to the parking lot to give me a record I left on the bar from a concert we attended earlier in the evening.\n\nThis place really is a comfortable and clean neighborhood bar that was welcoming to a random couple having a fun night on the town.  It was a great way to end a great night out.\n\nAlso, I would totally wear a friends T-shirt if they have them.  I love the logo."
1,This place is awesome. What I think an old fashioned supper club would be like.  Huge bar and lots of seating.  The cheese curds are delicious and the fish fry is a must order! Good parking too.
0,"The service is always friendly however I was overcharged and she didn't realize it. I pointed it out and she still thought it was right.  She tried to explain that it was tax, which it wasn't because the base price was $4.55 instead of $4.15.  She asked me to speak to her manager so she could explain it to me.  The manager acknowledged it was wrong but said that they don't set the prices so they can't help.  Wow!!"
0,"I stayed at the Trump Hotel for 2 nights this week for work, and was incredibly disappointed at the lack of transparency surrounding phone charges.  I was taking meetings all morning today.  My phone died late morning, and I had to use the hotel room phone to complete my calls.   When I went to check out, I learned I'd been charged $164 for 47 min spent on the room phone.  The price for calls wasn't listed anywhere on the phone, as is generally done at respectable hotels, and while I knew it wouldn't be free, would've completely rescheduled my meetings had I known I'd be charged so excessively.\n\nWhen I brought this up to the desk clerk - who appeared to be about 21 yrs old - he said that was just the policy and at check-in should've been told that only local calls were included.  I was never told that, and asked if I could speak to a manager.  He went back to retreive a manager, but instead came back and offered to take half off one of the 2 charges.  I didn't have time to haggle, so just accepted it and went to the airport.\n\nI am incredibly disappointed at the lack of transparency, and then the lack of responding to the issue I raised professionally.  The manager couldn't even come out to the front desk to speak with me personally?  I assumed the Trump organization would have more professional staff employed.\n\nEven with 50% removed from one of the charges, I was still charged $102.48 for 47 min of talk time.  I don't think I should be charged anything considering a) lack of phone information clearly displayed or explained, and b) lack of professional demeanor in handling my conflict.\n\nThe only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 here is because a) the hotel and room were beaufiful, and b) Nathan, one of the valets, was extremely nice and helpful every time I had a question re: directions.\n\nPS - also negative?  NO casino!!"
0,"I usually don't like ripping on places too often but people are WAY too high on this place. ITS  A DUMP! It's full of bratty screaming kids, dirty-nasty-stained-clothing and shoes and there's always a need for police there. I could see if it actually sold desirable clothing there but I wouldn't even call it last years fashions. Most of the stuff there was never \""in style.\"" It smells like a sewer in there as well. I would rather pay full retail for something then to ever step foot in this dump."
0,"I think this place needs help.  NOT Recommended.\n\n1st - Some of the staff is unprofessional and can be arrogant - Customer Service is not a priority at this location.\n\n2nd - OVERPRICED and maybe \""shady\"".  I've stopped in to get a quote for a repair needed and their quote was 75% above another local reputable repair shop.  \n\n3rd - I've been here before for an oil change and I had my car returned dirty and leaky.\n\nLastly, look at the other posts here on yelp...\n I think their overall rating speaks for itself."
1,I love this place! My husband and I are often here dining in or taking things to go. I love that they use fresh organic and non gmo ingredients- it's so hard to find a place in the Vegas area that commits to this. I find the staff to be very nice and friendly. Thanks for making such good wholesome food! You have a loyal customer here.
1,"After moving to Arizona to accept a job offer, I had to find a new place to service my vehicles. I have been very pleased with the professionalism, speed of service, and quality of workmanship from this crew!\nI know what I want and need done to my cars. I put a lot if miles on my vehicles and am never pressured to get something I don't need. I purchased a replacement drain plug for one if my vehicles and they installed it at the time of a LOF. \nGreat guys in this shop. If you want honest people to work on your car, this is the crew. I don't trust any other shop in town to service my Dodge Durango and Subaru Outback sedan!\nThanks guys and I'll see you in 5,000 miles!"
1,"The Bagpus charity shop on Tollcross is a typical local charity shop.  You have the mandatory bookcase, clothes racks, ornaments and minimal items of furniture.  The prices continue on this level and you start to realise that these are prices of a local charity shop in a small town, yet the charity shop is in the middle of the city.  The result of all this is that you get a fantastic amount of bargains.\n\nYou may think I'm exaggerating, but let me tell you a story of the best deal I've ever had in a charity shop.  One day I walk in and there's two books (Agatha Christie's if you are interested) for 50p each; not a bad deal I thought so I bought them both.  Then a week later I'm back in and now they have more of these books, but now at 30p so I ended up buying 5 more - 5 books for \u00a31.50.  For some of the more expensive charity book shops you can't even buy one book for \u00a31.50, this really is a great value for money shop."
1,"West side off town and very nice off strip property.\nHas that Spanish / Mediterranean theme throughout the property.\nThe rooms are nicely appointed and the suite I was in had 2' bedrooms, 2  1/2 baths, bar, living room and wraparound balcony overlooking the landscape and pool areas. Yeah I roll like that. \nOk, service is good but not great overall. \nThe Aqua Sulis spa is one of the best in town. Spacious, calming and very good spa to serve you. On the pricier side but they pamper you with massage, huge sauna and steam rooms with spas and water therapy rooms . Try it it's worth paying up.\n\nThere are lots of restaurants and bars plus casino. 3 golf courses very close by too.\n\nOverall very good off strip resort. Especially if you don't like the hustle of the strip."
1,"We went there on November 23rd at around 11 am  and the place was just opening. They have about 8 tables but the place though modest, seems like clean. The prices are very reasonable and the food is good. This is not the place to take a date for the first time, or they will be underwhelmed. Its just a clean taco shop with cheap good food. We ordered burritos, carne asada tacos and a bean tostada. All of them very good. I will go back there when I go again to Phoenix."
0,Sprinkles cupcakes is nothing special and it just goes to show marketing is everything. The service is great and the presentation of the cupcakes is nice. When you see the pretty cupcakes in their nice box you really think you are getting a gourmet cupcake like other bakeries. The red velvet cupcake was Just ok. The Carmel apple and cinnamon sugar cupcakes were muffins. They were good but I was expecting a cupcake. The chocolate vanilla with sprinkles was the best but nothing to write home about. There are tons of great bakeries out there with amazing cupcakes. I will never come back here and I hope one day more people see past all the gimics and realize sprinkles is just a fancy store selling over priced regular old cupcakes and muffins.
1,"so I came into Strut last night... not really expecting nothing more than what I've dealt with amongst other bridal shops. Man!!! was I shocked... I'm a pretty simple girl in taste, but I'll be lying if I said that I wanted my dress to more than simple....it's my wedding day. I want a fabulous gown. But I say simple to keep me in a simple budget. My wedding is out of town... like 1500 miles away, and we just bought a house.. so my funds for a dress, was severely limited. Also my body type... I'm a curvy woman. I love my curves and wouldn't trade them in for nothing. But at most typical bridal shops, curvy dresses are either really ugly with an ugly price. So I gave up looking until i found Strut. As simple as 1-2-3... I found MY dress, in MY Budget, and MY body looked great in it. Stephanie walked me through the store. It was already late, and I was tired. The last thing I wanted to do was try on dresses, but she made it so enjoyable, and QUICK!! she asked me for my style and budget and stayed within those two guidelines. I tried on two dresses. The first one was cute, and well in my budget, but not for me ... the second one... was AMAZING on me. The way it fit, the price, the comfort that Steph gave me... the whole experience was GRAND. all because of the curvy plus size woman structure. In David's Bridal... their sample dress is like an 8... that's not an everyday woman. An everyday woman has curves! and she deserves to be a beautiful bride in a beautiful dress..\n\nThankyou for celebrating my curves!\n\n~Victoria..."
1,"Great food, great decor! Must go! 4.50 for breakfast croissant sandwich. So delicious and worth it..."
0,Good jambalaya and ok chili (the cheese is a slice just plopped on top) and cornbread... Great beer... But that's all I could eat. I have a severe fish allergy and it was that or a few of their salads (nothing with any meat though). Very disappointing that they hadn't thought about cross contamination with allergies. I'll go back for the soup and definitely the beer but it'll only be with friends... Not by myself. And only if other people suggest it. Very disappointing.
0,"UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES HIRE THIS COMPANY! \n\nWORST MOVING EXPERIENCE POSSIBLE!!!!! \n\nABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!

I kept calling and calling and finally someone called me back saying they'd be there at 7PM instead of 7AM ruining my entire day of moving. \n\nTo make matters worse they were lazy, threw my belongings around, and put everything right inside the door instead of in the appropriate rooms (ALL BOXES were labeled). \n\nOh and it gets even worse because they were smoking cigs and talking/hanging out on the clock and then stopped 40 minutes early and still charged me for the entire time!!!\n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY!!!!\nThe icing on the cake was that they couldn't work pay pal so wanted me to give them my debit card number over the phone to their boss before they would leave.... THEY ENDED UP STEALING MY CARD NUMBER AND ORDERING $90 OF PAPA JOHNS ON IT THE NEXT DAY!!!\n\nI called and left two voicemails that were never returned. Needless to say this entire company is a scam and I filed a police report on their CRIMINAL behavior.\n\nPLEASE DONT MAKE THE HORRID MISTAKE OF MOVING WITH THIS COMPANY!"

I asked for a #4 on the sides & back--didn't even get that.  I was in the chair a grand total of 10 minutes.\n\nFortunately my previous barber can get me in next week; unfortunately, I have to drive across town."

They were almost empty and had no flavor. Had been planning on ordering sweet crepes, too, but we left after eating just a few bites to have dinner elsewhere. These were by far the worst crepes we've ever had."

My friends have come here a few times now and it's definitely one of our usual dinner locations now.\n\nToday, I had to suffer through a really long wait for my food, which is unusual. Everyone had gotten their food but me, even though I ordered before some of them. Just as I started getting frustrated, a server ran over to me and refunded my order to apologize for the wait. That sort of courtesy gets my 5 stars!\n\nEdit: This was posted way after this was actually written. Written appx early October."
0,"This is by far the worst experience I had at a club in Vegas. We booked a $5,000 minimum table and the Hostess and the bus boy were just plain rude. Not only that the type of people who go there are ghetto and obnoxious.  \n\nPresale tickets are definitely cheaper at this club and there's a reason for that. It is because they are not selective in the crowd they bring in and this place is not classy at all. The girls and the crowd at this club were all ugly as hell.\n\nWe went to XS the next day and met some Vegas locals that just came from Hakkasan. They told us \""the crowd was so ghetto that we had to leave and come here.\"" Now I only booked a cabana at XS but the service and the people were 10000000x better than hakkasan was. \n\nTo be honest I only went to Hakkasan because I never been but if your thinking the same thing. Trust me its not worth it. Your gonna be in there packed like sardines with ugly smelly people. If you wanna fish can it then this might be the place for you but its definitely not for me.\n\nI also forgot to mention why I decided to actually create a yelp account to write this review.. Not only did I book that $5,000 dollar minimum table our group also got kicked out from it as well. \n\nSome passerby-er in the club decided to walk by and throw up in front of our table. The bus boy blamed it on our group and kicked us all out. When I asked him which one of us did you see do it he said that he didn't know but it had to be ours because it was in front of our table. No one in my group was even drunk yet and I would know if it was someone from our that threw up. It definitely was not us and the bus boy didn't even know who it was. He merely made a judgement call based on what he saw in front of the table. I gave a $500 hand shake tip in the beginning too..."

1,"Once upon a time in a far away land there lived a boy that could celebrate Octoberfest no more than one month a year.  He would order seconds and thirds of his favorite schnitzel and bratwurst dishes, fill his gullet with authentic German bier till he couldn't walk and toast the night away with good friends as the polka band would play his favorite drinking songs.  He would wake up the next morning with a pounding in his head, his voice gone from singing at the top of his lungs and sounds of accordions and tubas resonating in his ears.  Just to do it all over again night after night until the festival was no more.  He would have to wait another long and uneventful eleven months until the magic would return. Until now.\n\nThe moment you walk through the door you can't help but smile and think to yourself,\""It's party time\"" or in my case,\""lets get Fing Fed up\"".  The band is rocking, or as much as a polka band could rock, the crowd is rowdy, and I mean dancing on top of tables rowdy and bent over getting spankings from jager girls rowdy. The waitresses have German accents, and I mean real accents, not BS fake medieval times accents. \n\nWaiter: \""Would me lord wisheth more ale\""\nMe:\""Cut the crap Sir D Bag and get me a beer.\"" \n\nI also love how this place forces you to socialize.  You can't ask for a table for two and expect a quite romantic dinner.  Your seated at large picnic style benches perfect for standing and splashing beer on.  \n\nOK so now on to the food.  The dinners are not too pricey the couple times I have been I have spent about $16 a plate.  I usually get the Nurnberger Rostbratwurstl it consist of 3 pork sausages with sauerkraut, mash potatoes and gravy.  Dudes, believe me when I tell you, this stuff is absolutely amazing.  If you're only experience with bratwurst is something you get out of a package from your local piggly wiggly, forget everything you thought you knew and get ready for the pork epiphany.  Every bite you take will open new doors of flavor and flavor combinations.  If your anything like me and like to drink as much as you like to eat you will actually end up spending more money on beer than you will on food.  Last time I was there I had 3 liters of beer, one of the dunkelweizen, one of the hefeweizen and one pilsner.  The dunkel was my absolute favorite out of the three.  So all in all if your looking for a place to get rowdy, dance on top of the tables, take shots of jager, get spanking from jager girls as well as get a top notch meal in the mean time look no further."

0,"We went to Vegas to celebrate my birthday.We stayed at the Encore and SInatra's came highly recommended.....what a disappointment!!  We sat on the patio which was lovely, but the service was awful! Our server had no back up and she was serving 5 tables on her own! We waited 20min before we even were able to order a bottle of wine or cocktail. They were out of the wine we ordered ($52), so we had to order a more expensive bottle. We finally ordered the lasagna and the veal milanese..both house specialties...we were told. The lasagna was good, however our server offered to take it out of the casserole dish for me because it was too hot, but she never returned! The veal was awful and very expensive ($51)...it had absolutely no flavor and was tough. It was served with a tomato puree' instead of chopped tomatoes on the salad...it tasted like Campbell's tomato soup!We finally complained and then had several people come by to check on us. The manager offered to buy us a \""moscato\"" after dinner..but it was too little too late. They ruined my birthday dinner for $235.00! I should add that we are in the (Italian)restaurant business in New York. We dine out frequently and travel extensively...with all of the great restaurants and chefs in LV, I would pass on this one!"

1,"I came to Stephano's wanting to fulfill a gyro craving, which was satisfied! Located right across the university, this Greek/Mediterranean spot is delicious.

It was around lunch time when I went & it wasn't too busy, but people started arriving shortly after. \n\nI had heard of the place & it had always came up on my yelp when I looked for gyros, hummus or shawarmas so decided to check it out. \n\nThe fellow that took my order was friendly & so was the one who gave me my order. \n\nThe menu had a variety of items to choose from, from baba ganoush to all types of hummus & Mediterranean dishes & as much as I wanted to try all of them I just wanted a gyro. They had lunch specials as well at good prices. \n\nMy gyro was delicious & the meat was juicy & tender. I am not a big fan of lamb, but most gyros are mixed with beef & lamb so it was pretty good. I love fries & fry sauces & Stephano's serves their fries with a killer fry sauce that's tangy & compliments their seasoned fries well. \n\nAll in all I would return because to try their falafel sandwich."

A week later they installed them and I am happy with the work, not a hard job though at all. What I am not happy with is that after they were all done they   gave me a bill for $75.00 more than the quote and gave me a BS story about wheel lug nuts or something, which was included in the original quote by the way, and I was supposed to get locking lug nuts, I got none. I was going to have them do a clear bra and a custom installed radar detector ($2,200.00) also but now I will find another company. Not happy with the way they handled the whole deal, I will not go back or recommend them to anyone I know ever. Their customer service is way below avg. IMO"

Take a VIAGRA and your wallet, with you.\n\nThe parking availability is terrible.\nPlus the Valet reserved zones, have made it shopper unfriendly."
0,"If I could give less than one star I would. I can tell you exactly how awful this office is to work at and all of the negative comments are completely accurate. All one of the doctor's care about is making money and if you don't schedule your surgery he won't continue care with you and will discharge you from his patient clientele. He doesn't care about staff, nor does the business manager who is his wife. They degrade, put down and treat their employees like the scum on the bottom of shoes and look down on people who don't have money and pay crap for money so they have more to pocket. Believe me when I say your time is better spent at a doctor's office that cares about you and your well being, not just pocketing money. Not to mention your wait time being cut in half."
0,"I've lived in Las Vegas for 17 years, and have been to dozens of concerts at various properties. This is by far the worst experience for a concert to date. The staff was rude and unhelpful in providing directions. One staff member yelled at us when we asked why there were no signs telling people where to line up.  There was no order or organization whatsoever!  I'm sure the concert will be fantastic and make up for such horrible service, but I won't be back after this experience!"
0,IF you go here for lunch don't park in area that is continuation of the drive thru. \nOne person taking orders = a line that rapidly grows and a longer wait for something that shouldn't require a wait.\n The drive thru is typically the way I come through here and will be the only way from now on...
1,Went here once. They were good and tasty.
1,"Ate lunch at Courier Cafe today. I had not been here for quite some time.\n\nWe had a short wait to get seated, which was understandable since we came just after noon.  I would probably prefer to come for breakfast, but that wasn't in the cards today.\n\nThe service was very good. Our waitress was polite, food came in a reasonable time, and drinks were refilled regularly. We were also brought our check in a speedy manner, which I always like.\n\nFood: I had a buffalo chicken wrap, my wife had a hamburger and my son had a reuben sandwich and fries. All the food was very good.\n\nThe only negative is the scrum at the front door/register when you are on the waiting list or paying your bill. Of course, part of the charm of Courier is the old time feeling the place gives, and a large waiting room would probably detract from that.\n\nNext trip: breakfast!"
1,"I guess this is the place to comment on First Fridays.  I went to it tonight and it was a blast.  It was really nice to see lots of kids and families out experiencing art of various types.  It's really an impressive array of work.  The quality varies, but there's something for everyone I would guess.  I only hit about 25 spots in one neighborhood around Roosevelt/1st - 7th/the other random side streets around the area.\n\nLoved the use of the housing as studios and the welcoming atmosphere.  There were a ton of cops around too for some reason."
1,"There are a few things I will remember, recollect and miss about places I visited in Tempe and Phoenix area this last month.  While the studio is in a small business building and seems quite small from outside, the yoga space is actually quite big and with one wall mirrored gives a roomy feel. \n\nI've probably attended 9 classes here with different instructors.  Most of the classes seem quite energetic and the instructors are really friendly.  Monday nights, there's an 'off the wall' class which I highly recommend to anyone who is interested in learning inversions.  Cynthia focusses on strengthening your core and shoulders to do inversions.  It's the kind of class that makes you feel so hot inside that you actually feel cool when you leave the studio to a 100\u00baF outside!\n\nDanielle is an excellent instructor who has the best music playing during class.  I don't think I'll ever be able to have as peaceful a shavasana as I've had in her energetic class which ends with \""The Long Road\"" by Eddie Vedder and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.  Sara (O'Connor) focusses on stretches and while her class is a nudge more passive, expect lactic acidosis in your limbs!  I've enjoyed all their classes.\n\nWhile I'm certainly not an expert on yoga and am still far from a 'Level 2' kinda yoga guy, I must say that finding home at this studio on my one month away from my home was just perfect.  Expect to be challenged in most classes and hope you try it out and discover how capable you are!"
1,"I love this place.  The lunch buffet is amazing (especially considering it's less than $11 per person). They have a good variety of different rolls and Chinese food on the lunch buffet.  For the dinner menu they also have extensive options, and a specials sheet that changes seasonally (which is really nice).  While the dinner menu is obviously pricier than the lunch menu it is still reasonable.  I recommend trying this place out, if for nothing else, for the lunch buffet!"
1,Really tasty sandwiches and queso! They were dog friendly and came over and visited and gave my dog some bacon. Only problem was they didn't give us plates with our queso so we made a mess. I'll be coming back though.
0,"I felt that this place was overpriced for less than average Indian food. What sets this place apart the most is the absolutely horrible service. I tried it three times. I try to always do that if I feel that there might be something I miss on the first or second time at a restaurant. I kept hoping maybe it was a single server...then two...when it hit three separate poor servers, I was done. The food is merely okay for the price paid-the service ensures I won't return. Long waits at the door (with open tables visible), attitude and exceptionally long waits for orders placed are why I give it 1 star. In addition, it's like a cave inside."
0,"I had high hopes for this place.  We were drawn in by the vegan and vegetarian signs.  There are tons of signs. On the other hand, we came in at dinner time on a saturday and the place was empty; literally. We were handed menus and were shocked to see it was a regular restaurant with small vegetarian section.  We were about to leave and told them we thought it was a veggie restaurant and then we were handed veggie menus.\n\nWe ordered soy beef noodle soup and the waitresses was gonna put in an order for real beef. We had to tell her four times.  Needless to say we were very worried. The cook came out and double checked our order and assured us we ordered vegetarian dishes.\n\nThe soup was good. However after our meal, their credit card machine was down and someone had to call in the card number over the phone.  The cook (owner??) seemed really nice and she said she was veggie and was transitioning the restaurant.  In my opinion this place could benefit from going 100% veg and advertising."
1,"One of the best places to spa in the Valley.  My favorite place.  The staff make your time there, a time of peace and R & R."
0,"So after 17 years of passing this place driving to Vegas we finally decided to stop for the $6.99 buffet and \""GIANT SALAD BAR.\""  So yes, its a \""throwback\"" casino or as I prefer to say, whoever owns it isn't putting any money into it and reaping the benefits of running a dive-casino and hotel. \n\nWhile I'd never stay the night here (I'd rather sleep on the side of the road in my car and take my chances), the buffet was equivalent to a nursing home and doubles as the employee cafeteria. Standard mashed potato based foods and casseroles, spaghetti, mac & Cheese, fired chicken, and gravy all bland just like at grandmas retirement village. \n\nThe \""GIANT SALAD BAR\"" right; thats counting the tuna salad mix, macaroni salad, loaded potato salad, tuna macaroni salad, you get the picture....other than that its a normal salad bar.\n\nThe ice cream was good, I know, I know \""What do I expect for $6.99.\"""
0,"...can someone please explain to me why anyone would venture to this place, or how it is a sustainable business model to place a bunch of upscale stores and subpar dining options way down in Henderson without a single anchor store to be found?  Admittedly visiting myself to take a look at the Whist menu (yawn) before perusing the d\u00e9cor at the sister cocktail bar next door there is not one thing worth coming to The District for that cannot be found within a fifteen minute drive - both new restaurants included."
1,"The panoramic room upgrade was really nice on floor 62.  Wifi worked fine for us and was included in the resort fee, though you have to click through some web forms that tell you as much.  There is no floor 40 - 49 so it's not as quite high as it sounds, though still an awesome view North to downtown and the mountains.  The view seemed to put my lovely date into a very romantic mood, so good times were had - and the room mirrors seemed to multiply the visual pleasures.  We turned in well after midnight but heard no club thump at our level/side though I knew in advance that the party was on with Diplo spinning.  The gym room was nice and big, open 6A to 8P.  Heavy on machines and treadmills but still enough room and apparatus (free weights, kettles, bands, balls, etc.) to train strength and functional stuff with my trainer/wife, so that experience worked out well.  We didn't see all of the resort in our two night stay, but what I did see, I liked and there was a lot to look at.  The giant hanging fresh flower balls in the atrium were impressive and demanded photos be taken.  Wazuzu food sucked in my opinion and sundries store items were crazy money expensive but those are minor complaints.  Society cafe breakfast was excellent by contrast, though not cheap.  I also dug the Alexander McQueen shop at Wynn with the stylee skull themed gear - though I could barely afford an accessory there, I wanted to buy more.  The resort location rocked, close to the classier end of the strip, adjacent to the Fashion show and Palazzo.  I didn't drop a penny at the casino, but witnessed many other people appearing to enjoy that side of it.  Consensus is that we had a great time on our short stay."
0,"Worst. Experience. Ever.\n\nI went in to buy a new phone. They told me they didn't have it there and would have to order it. I wasn't too happy about this but they  told me it would be \""like 2 to 4 days.\""  I ordered a phone on December 1st and, after tons of phone calls that *I* made (they never bothered to check in or call me), it finally came in on the 21st.\n\nWhile I understand this was in part due to the phones being on back order (how can you not know that if you work at a phone store??), it was still a huge hassle for me and they didn't and WOULDN'T give me anything for my ordeal. They could have thrown in some screen protectors or something and I would have been satisfied. But the girl didn't offer, and when I asked it was just \""sorry.\"" I was also told they could get me a better deal on my plan. Did they? Nope. She didn't even try. \n\nI hope to God I never have to deal with these people ever again, and I will tell anyone I meet never to go there. Ridiculous."
0,"Terrible, terrible, terrible customer service. \nWe came in for dinner at 7pm. The restaurant was not busy, with only a few table sitting down. It took the server at least 10 minutes to come take our order. \nWe asked that my mom's order (two appetizers) be brought out with the rest of our entrees, since she ordered appetizers for her entree. And we also asked for our mussels to be brought out as an appetizer. The waitress did the complete opposite of what we asked, and then looked at us like we were crazy when we said something. \nWhen we finally got our mussels, we were expecting for our food to come out shortly after. It did not. It took another forty minutes, and for us to ask to speak to a manager before my boyfriend's food to come out. The manager said \""I'm sorry it's taking so long, we have a lot of 'to go' orders\"". (Which in my opinion is the definition of poor customer service). \nMy mom and my boyfriend got their food, but I still sat for another 15 minutes waiting for my sushi roll. (The total waiting time at this point was one hour and twenty minutes). \nWhen we asked for the check, we were appalled to find that we were charged for the full meal, and they even charged us $2.00 for club soda (which is basically water).  \nMy boyfriend (who never, ever complains at restaurants) decided to say something to the manager. She told us that she was going to comp our drinks and give us a 10% discount. We thought that would be reasonable and were prepared to pay. When we got our check back, only 10% was taken off the bill. I went to go looking for the manager again, and found her taking care of her son behind the bar. When I brought to her attention the fact that she didn't comp the drinks, she looked at me and pointed to the 10% discount. I told her right there and then, that the customer service at this place is awful, that we'd pay the bill, but we were never coming back, and that I was going to write a review and warn folks of the way that they treat their customers. (As a side note, the 10% discount did not even cover the price of the sushi roll that I waited for an hour and twenty minutes for). \nAnother manager came up to us right before we were leaving and began \""apologizing\""  for the bad night that we had. He made a bunch of excuses as to why everything was so bad, and offered us a what we heard as a \""fifty\"" percent discount, and asked my boyfriend if that was reasonable. My boyfriend said \""sure, that sounds ok\"". When we got our check, he gave us a 15% discount, which in my opinion is absurd, and it STILL did not cover the price of the stupid sushi roll. \nWe paid our tab, did not say anything else, and ended up leaving a $10 tip. \nIn conclusion, the restaurant management REALLY dropped the ball on customer service that night. Don't tell your customers that you're \""really busy because [you] have to go orders\"". You need to focus on the customers that are sitting in your restaurant, and if you're that busy, get in the kitchen and help your staff handle the orders instead of taking care of your kid that shouldn't be at work with you in the first place. Second, if you're going to send another manager over to talk to your customers, don't continue to give the same excuses, and offer a joke of a discount. \nThis place wasted our time and the food was sub par. \nNever going there again."
0,"I don't believe all these 5 star reviews can be real. They must be friends of the owner because this was the most sleazy, money-grubbing experience I've ever had. They try to squeeze every penny out of you in such an uncomfortable way. \n\nOnce I was seated I was asked what I would like to drink, I replied \""nothing right now, thanks.\"" The server then told me that I'm required to buy a drink. I felt bad for her, because it was such an awkward thing to have to tell someone. I wondered what would happen if I refused... would they kick me out? They lost any future business from me right there and then anyway. Its not like it was busy either, there was one other table occupied. \n\nThen I was told that me and my three friends couldn't share a hookah, we had to pay for two, even if sharing only one.\n\n\""Oh but we don't have menus\"" so here have an awkward moment using my point of sale app on my iPad so you can decide a flavor, because we don't want to spend the money to print a list of flavors. \n\nThe thing was, I wasn't looking for a bargain. I really wasn't concerned about the price. But by being forced to buy multiple hookahs and forced to buy a drink it made the experience very negative, despite the fact that I would have purchased those things anyway. \n\nOtherwise the service was good, but I mean there was no one else there so I can't give them too much credit. And the hookah was sub par. The vent on the hookah was clogged (this is something you would only notice if you have a lot of experience with hookahs) meaning you can't clear the jar of smoke and it doesn't hit efficiently. This is a sign that they don't maintain them very well. This was the case on both of the hookahs we ordered. I had to open the valves myself and clean out the bearings there so we could vent our hookahs properly. When I worked at a hookah lounge we would replace your hookah if the valve was not working properly. \n\nThe server insisted I smoked from a piece of fruit instead of a ceramic head. After telling her \""no\"" more than once I finally submitted, and as I expected the fruit provided less smoke than a ceramic head. I imagine they use some cheap tobacco that burns up really quick, so they push the fruit to make it last longer. It does last longer, but at the expense of good and heavy smoke. \n\nMY ADVICE TO THE MANAGEMENT: Instead of trying to squeeze every penny out of your customers in order to raise your average sale, try to provide great experiences. By the lack of customers on a Friday night, I'm guessing your current methods aren't working very well!"
0,"My husband and I used to go here a lot, but under new management and different workers, the food just isn't that great anymore."
0,"Yea, they also have a place here in Chicago. I gotta say I was really bumbed by the poor service and the fact that two of the folks who ordered their signature burgers cooked med, received them cooked well-done. Their server should also know that when everyone at the table begins to play with their smartphones, it's time to bring the check. We sat their for 15 minutes just playing on our phones. I'll give this establishment a try here in Chicago and see what I come up with."
0,"Being a business owner myself, I have always lived by the mantra that the customer is always right. This is definitely not the case with this business. I have a video production company and my crew of 2 contractors is working today at the KROC's Boy's and Girls Club literally across the street from this place. I'm currently in New York over the holidays so I'm doing my best to provide them lunch the best I can with the resources available to me. And being that I searched for \""delivery\"" on Yelp and this place has a \""yes\"" under delivery, I would assume I could get the food delivered. That wasn't the case today. The person that answered the phone said \""No delivery driver today\"". Like, what? Is there a schedule for when I can get delivery and when I can't? So, whatever, no problem. I said, that's fine, I'll just order the food and have one of my guys come pick it up real quick. I told him the situation and I asked if I could just pay for the food over the phone since I wasn't in the area and I needed to get these guys lunch. He said \""No, we don't do that.\"" Ok, so if someone orders delivery from you guys (on the on days for delivery at that), I'm sure they take the credit card over the phone and get it dropped off no problem, as I'm sure the delivery drivers don't walk around with credit card swipers. Long story short, this guy obviously didn't want my business because he was the most un-accomidating POS as I tried endlessly to find a solution without having these guys come out of their pockets to pay for a meal that me as the business owner should be providing them. It's a shame too because we have a contract for the next year where we'll be filming at that location one weekend a month which could have equaled some good business for these people over the year, but, being less than a smart business man, this person didn't see it that way. It's crazy to me too because our business isn't even a consumer based company and I can sit on my couch at my house and take credit card from my clients over my phone like nothing, and these guys act like it's no big deal to turn away clients. If you need some delivery, don't even bother reaching out to Tam's. If you're local and are going to eat at this shop, do me a favor and slap this guy squarely across the top of his head for me. Happy days!"
1,"it was good,"
0,"A nice location and pleasant atmosphere. Service started very well, but went downhill fast. \n\nWe started both appetizer specials of the day.  \n\nThe first - deep fried meatballs - was okay; nothing to write home about. We later added them to our entrees, and they felt like they belonged better there. \n\nThe second - a selection of 2 each of their popular appetizers -was a mixed bag. Fried mozarella sticks and fried ravioli were both tasty.  Calamari was soggy and limp. The real problem was the shared dipping sauce which was just plain bland and boring. Adding crushed chili peppers gave it a bit of a bite, but it was still a losing cause. Squirting fresh lemon on the calamari did nothing to help the taste and just made them soggier. . \n\nThe main course was spaghetti bolognese (we asked, and they substituted fettuccine) and this dish was just adequate.  It felt like they had added too much cream to the red sauce, and it was smooth and orange, instead of lumpy and bright red. I hate to say this, but the bolognese sauce at even the Olive Garden is much better. After we'd started eating, the waitress came over and apologized that she had forgotten to bring us our salad.  She offered to pack it to go, but we declined.  \n\nAfter we'd finished, we just waited and waited and waited.  We piled our dirty dishes in an effort to neaten our table, but no one approached us to clear the dishes, offer us dessert or coffee.  The restaurant was not particularly busy and we could see the two waitresses standing in the kitchen watching the cooks at work.  About 20 mins after we had finished, we were finally able to catch the attention of the maitre d' who finally summoned one of the waitresses for us.\n\nTerrible service notwithstanding, the food itself was simply too bland and boring to consider giving this place another chance. A pizza being carried to another table looked tempting, but not enough to warrant another roll of the dice."
1,"The pizza here, phenomenal! They have a sweeter marinara sauce, it's to die for. Their appetizer 3 meatballs in vodka cream sauce, ahh melt in your mouth amazing. I tried the spaghetti calzone in vodka cream sauce this last time, and it was great! Service is always good. If it's busy, which it always is, food can take a little while to come out, but it's worth it!! Oh and you get a free canoli on your birthday :)"
0,"You know, we have supported this place from day one.  We have gone there when NO ONE went there.  We actually didn't think it would stay open, so we kept going hoping it would make it.  Well, we actually went there this past weekend after having very mediocre service and food for the past couple of visits.  It was packed and the place appeared still be doing great.  When our food came it was good but our 8 year old dropped his toast.  We asked if he could get another piece and the waiter said \""sure\"".  Well, when the owner saw this she refused.  She wouldn't even allow the waiter to get him a single piece of bread without paying for a full order or toast.  The waiter was even stunned she was so rude about it.  ???  Are you kidding me?  When my wife asked her why she couldn't just let the waiter get a single piece of toast, she just blew off my wife.  We just spent $60 for breakfast and she couldn't get our kid a single piece of bread without paying for a full order.  \n\nI think the egos of these owners are getting out of control. We have 2 other friends who have had similar experiences with different issues.  Too bad that success has driven such arrogance.  We won't be back...ever."
0,"Yea ok I came in with high expectations other than burnt rice and hot pot of curry. Mmmm and Kim Chee....So it made me poo....Yea I got sick. After 1 bottle of immodium. A roll of tums, and 2 things of pepto. I stopped impersonating a straw for five days. Ask my boss...It was rough...Sick and dehydrated.....There were some good things on the menu. But seriously the kim chee really did look old. It was like they got the water from Korea. I'll stick Korean Barbeques from now on."
1,We had a great meal and a great time at Andiamo!  Ask for Iaon as a waiter - he's fantastic!\n\nSausage & peppers were excellent!  Tomahawk steaks were great!  Tableside Caesar salad prepared by Iaon was excellent.\n\nNo complaints at all....you get what you pay for in this world and it's worth it at Andiamo!
0,"A lovely idea for a business and I was looking forward to trying this place when it opened last year. However, when I went along and tried some of the beers on offer, I was totally shocked at the prices being charged. Prices vary from around \u00a36 to nearly \u00a310 for a litre of beer! That is way more expensive than pub prices (as an average), so I fail to see how this business can be a success going forward. Yes, I understand that dealing in small batches of beer and regularly changing the beers on offer, will add cost but if you get yourself to somewhere like Stewart Brewing at Loanhead you get draught beer to take away in bottles, in exactly the same way as Growler Beers of Morningside but Stewart's are around half the price with draft beer ranging from around \u00a33.80 to less than \u00a35. There can be no justification for this kind of extra cost being charged by Growler Beers and I think the owner needs to rethink his strategy, as every time I pass the shop, it is empty. It looks like the high prices are keeping the punters away! Oh and by the way, Stewart Brewing do some excellent beers!"
0,"The wait staff was very friendly, and we arrived around 11:30--just before the lunch rush.  The food was OK, but not really worth the drive and parking to downtown. And I LOVE a good breakfast place.   My friend had the egg truffle sandwich, which she said was pretty good, and I had bacon and eggs, which were decent (but insanely greasy).  The beignets that arrived before the meal were also good--but also incredibly greasy.  At around noon, the crowd picked up and it was very busy.  \n\nThe kicker for Eat, and the reason I won't be returning, is that upon receiving our credit cards back from the bill, we noticed a photocopied note that had been highlighted, which (very condescendingly) stated that split checks during \""slammed\"" times was not appreciated.  Now, had we been TOLD that by the waitress prior to running our check, we would not have split it (down the middle, not by item, mind you).  After an inordinate amount of time between the end of our meal, the dropping of the check, and the waiting for our credit cards back, we were informed by one of the wait staff that Eat only has one credit card machine.  Seriously?  With all the free card runners (Square, etc...) out there, an establishment is going to blame the customer for the slow down of running two cards? And again, it was not busy when we entered, and had the bill been dropped in a timely manner, we could have been on our way, leaving behind us a free table for the crowd.  So there you have it.  Decent, greasy, initial service was friendly, incredibly rude and condescending upon receiving the bill."
1,"For the price, this was a great stay. The lobby is beautiful. The restaurant/bar is good and reasonably priced ($5 beer and $13 dinner, not bad for a hotel). Bed was very comfortable with super soft pillows. It is a bit close to the interstate, so there is road noise, but certainly not more than the point of a minor distraction. Bathroom has been updated, but the room carpet is a bit out of date; but I'm not sleeping on the floor, so I can put up with that. This is a great hotel for a 3 1/2 star in Hotwire. I would stay here again; nice assortment of tap beer and seasonal beer favorites."
1,Hems...\n\nWill always like this place because of so many great memories there.\n\nThey have pretty decent food and a good selection of beers for a college bar.  Prices are very good but can get extreamly crowded at night and on weekends.
1,"Always one of my favorite places to go when I have family visiting. The large portions can feed a whole family. The calamari is one of the best I have eaten, so that is a must have."
1,"My wife and I went there last week for breakfast.  First time there.  This is one of the best crepe places that we have eaten at. We have tried many places in Vegas,  Quebec, Montreals, Canada. Good selection for sweet creeps and regular breakfast and lunch style crepes. Saw the Greek salad crepes, and look so good. Friendly staffs, clean, and good selection of different water that you have to serve yourself. They put cucumber and lemon in a water pitcher that you can serve yourself. There were one more but does not remember. They are very busy on the weekends according to a staffer. There are line of people waiting. I gave a four instead of five, because you kind of have to serve yourself with water. Not sure if this a restaurant, restaurant or a Starbucks type. They bring you your food at the table. I tip like I would at a restaurant, but you have a server at the restaurant. This is not a big deal. We would come back, nd recommend to our friends."
1,"I went with a large group of people on a Friday night.  They don't take reservations, so it took us about an hour to be seated.  Service was prompt, but the waitress had so many tables it took about 45 minutes for the food to come after ordering.  Some of us wanted desert, so that took an extra 45 minutes.  The place is packed with lines coming out the door most of the time.  Personally, I think the food is good, but not good enough to wait for.  I also think prices are pretty high.  Two alcoholic beverages, a main course, and a desert is about 50 bucks a person."
1,Chose 4 different tacos which had very different flavors and all were very good. I'd definitely come back here next time I'm in town.
1,"My boyfriend and I came here for date night while we were in Vegas. We really enjoyed our experience. We got a table that overlooked the fountain at Bellagio, which was beautiful. Our waiter was the nicest gentleman. We had a great time chatting up with him. We had heard wonderful things about the spaghetti so we both got that and devoured it. Their drinks were delicious and so was the complimentary bread. They catered to us very well and we were delighted. We were so stuffed so we didn't have room for dessert but I'm sure they were just as good. Highly recommend this place!"
0,"I've had sushi boat here with one of my friend. The fish was not fresh at all and I feel like I've got ripped off! I don't think I am ever going back here again. I am a raw fish/sashimi person. I don't usually eat cooked/warm Japanese. Maybe their rice ball or warm dish are better. However, the only good thing I liked at this restaurant is their WASABI! I have to admit I loved it! \n\nIs it just impossible to find fresh sashimi in Pittsburgh?"
0,"Lots of people to help but too busy talking to each other...so, I left..."
0,"To give it two stars is being generous.  I don't even feel like reviewing this place.  The only reason we had so much fun being here is because we ignored all the negative stuff and just climbed.\n\nI'll just make this brief.\n\n1.)  It smells like socks and dirty shoes.  The ventilation is not very good and if you're there for hours, maybe you'll just get used to the stench.\n\n2.)  The receptionist was not helpful, condescending, and acted like helping us was too much out of the way.  Probably just got used to regulars and is very nice to them.  But to newbies, forget it.  My cousin is the nicest guy you could ever meet and will even go out of his way to buy food for the poor.  He just wasn't worth the time to be given good service to I think.\n\nI think if the smell wasn't so bad and if service was better I would recommend people to come here or myself to come here to have fun."
1,"Sensational Food, Spellbinding View\n\nThe Fountains Brunch at Jasmine may be the best Sunday brunch you've never heard of. In comparison to the more famous Sterling Brunch across the Strip at Bally's, many people aren't aware that on Sunday, Jasmine in the Bellagio opens at 11 a.m. for a luxe, Cantonese/dim sum/all American breakfast brunch. The room is decorated in florals and creams... it's a bit old lady, but never feels stuffy, especially with sunlight streaming through the windows on a bright morning. Better yet, the room's floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the Bellagio fountains, which go into overdrive especially for brunch patrons. Fountain music is pumped into the room every 15 minutes as the fountains perform. \n\nOutside of the fountains, the centerpiece of the brunch is a fantastic buffet. It's not massive, but there's a wide variety of superbly prepared dishes. Traditional american brunch favorites are here, with the usual Bellagio-classy twists: the belgian waffles are red velvet, the eggs benedict are served on a lobster-potato cake. There's an excellent raw bar, a selection of caviar and sushi, and awesome cold bites and cheeses.There's also an omelet station, but a better choice is the soup, where a chef customizes asian-style noodles to your liking. The carving station has huge chunks of beef, lamb, and incredible carved slab bacon. The dim sum components are great too: sui mai, short ribs, crystal prawns. Best of all, they serve fantastic peeking duck table side in steamed buns. \n\nThe finale of brunch is a room devoted to desserts, and unlike many buffets, these are made in small batches by the pastry team and are quite good. Additionally, the pastry chef on staff chats and explains the different desserts, what was particularly good that day, and what ice creams and gelatos they've prepared. \n\nDownsides: it's not cheap ($80ish), and unlimited champagne is an add-on. (They have different levels of sparkling wines, and I believe the lowest was about $15?) I think they add gratuity automatically, but the service was so good when I went that my boyfriend and I ended up tipping more. \n\nOverall, this is a truly not-to-be-missed morning in Las Vegas. Make reservations, go hungry, and prepare to spend a few hours indulging yourself. If nothing else, this is probably the classiest way to deal with a hangover on the Strip."
0,"Worst McDonald's ever...tweekers \""spare changing\"" freely, some lady threatened to beat another lady's ass, following her around yelling, dirty drink area, etc. The building looks good, as the only good point. I'll never return to this location if I can avoid it!"
0,"Checked in on Friday, December 26 - Checked out Monday December 29.. I will never ever stay here again.  Our restroom was gross!!! Mildew all around the tub, the wall was falling apart.... Towels that were there were stained with black and to top it off our bathroom sink was clogged!! No point calling to complain was left on hold forever.  I will never stay at this hotel and I would not recommend to any, you would think for being a hotel right on the strip it would be up to date however NOPE!"
1,"Calamansi juice is the best refreshment on a hot Vegas morning.  Mmmm.  My fam and I ordered that variety platter of grilled meat - pork, beef, chicken.  Delicious!!  I especially love the fact that they have all the dipping sauces Filipino's need - namely, the soy sauce and vinegar.  Yum!  We also ordered some soup and the pork chops.  I was in heaven.  Why didn't anyone ever tell me about this place before??\n\nMy dad ordered the halo-halo, which he was impressed with.  I loved that there was a scoop of ube ice cream - I never see that here!  Also, we tried their special dessert - Turon Delight.  It's basically turon (fried banana dumpling) topped with ice cream.  It was good and just enough for 3 of us to split!\n\nService is fast and friendly...and it got pretty packed about half an hour after opening.  (They open at 11am on Saturday, btw.  My fam and I were sitting in the car, waiting for them to open.  How sad.)\n\nOh!  And they serve breakfast all day!!  Chorizo, scrambled eggs and rice anytime you want it??  Nothing beats that!"
0,I am sad to say I was very disappointed by their hotel service... Upon arrival we were told that the 700sqft suite with two queen beds we reserved was unavailable because of the hotel being over booked. So we were downgraded to a 500sqft suite with two queen beds... We were comp'ed six wrist bands for Rehab and received $100 off our first nights stay and told to call in the morning for a room change. The next morning I was told that our room would not be available for the rest of the weekend but we could take a 700sqft suite with one king bed... because we had four people staying in the room we opted to stay in the smaller suite but because we had booked the larger suite we were told that no matter which room we took we would still have to pay for the 700sqft suite for the remaining two nights... we were appalled!!! After a long conversation we decided to take the larger suite and resorted to sleeping on floors and couches because the hard rock does not have pull out couches and never sent the roll away to our room even after repeated requests...\n\nOn the up side the rooms were AMAZING and the pool was gorgeous but our stay was ruined by the lack of service...\n\nBEWARE: if you book a room with two queen beds you are NOT guaranteed two queen beds... you are given what's available upon arrival no matter how many people are staying in the room!!!
1,"Dieu du Ciel is my favorite brew pub in Montreal. The beer is amazing and there are always different choices of seasonal beers. The place has its own vibe, noisy crowds and good service. If you need a snack try the Quebec cheese and meet platters."
0,"Service was HORRIBLE. I was with my family and we asked this guy named Gustavo for the prices. after I figured out that he didn't give us all the options he said \""look it's not my obligation to give you all the options.\"" As a result, we were basically short of $7.95. He was soo rude. He kept interrupting me and wouldn't let me finish my sentences, didn't help us at all. I had to keep talking louder because he kept interrupting me and ended up yelling at me. I left incredibly angry. I would not recommend coming here at all. Their gelato wasn't even that good. The flavor wasn't very brought out and it was too watery."
0,"Corporate chain restaurants aren't usually places I visit often, and when I do I generally have much scrutiny and suspicion. I know that might sound bad but I have good reason, Ive been burnt way to many times. Ive dealt with horrible service, unimaginative food and the whole annoying corporate shtick, complete with high chairs and screaming unmanageable children. Please don't get me wrong, Ive had similar disasters at locally owned restaurants, but knowing I'm keeping my hard earned money in the community makes that brutally shrieking kid a little less bothersome.\n\nThe North Scottsdale location of Butterfield's caught me off guard. I was all primed to dislike everything, but was surprised with a few of the dishes and the service was fast, efficient, and well, annoyingly friendly. How anyone can be that chipper at 7:30am is beyond me.\n\nBeing a small national chain, only 4 location, they are complete with lame corporate shtick. Look up in the massive dining room and you'll see pictures of buttered and syrup laden waffles on the ceiling. Then there's the behemoth menu complete with \""Egg-ceptional\"" Eggs and \""Egg-cellent\"" Specialties, I wonder who makes this stuff up? I suppose some will find this clever.\n\nWith such a huge menu it took a few minutes to try to find the unique and interesting dishes. Started out with the Dutch Baby ($7.25); a large oven baked pancake that's finished with lemon juice, powdered sugar and optional syrup. The texture is light and airy comparable to a crepe with a crisp edge. Order this upon sitting, it could take up to 30 minutes to make depending on how busy the restaurant is.\n\nBiting into something heartier, The Bacon and Onion Skillet ($7.95) was well portioned for the low price tag. Crispy hashbrowns, bacon, grilled onions, 2 eggs with your choice of cheese and bread, was simple and satisfying.\n\nButterfield's originates from Illinois, so I should have given the Mexican Egg Burrito ($8.25) a little more thought before ordering. A whole wheat tortilla with chorizo, eggs and cheese, then in little plastic cups were sides of tasteless guacamole and salsa. Maybe in Illinois this is considered good but here in the land of Mexican food, it was a complete failure.\n\nSticking with the classics is a good idea, like the Country Benedict ($7.95). Perfectly cooked sausage patties on country biscuits then topped with eggs and country gravy. Though really, pretty much anything with pork and or egg yolks is going to be tasty.\n\nWhen ordering try not to change your selection to much, it's $.75 for every substitution you make. For instance, the Popeye Scramble ($7.95) comes with monterey jack cheese but to have feta instead as well as yellow onions, added $1.50 to the bill. I mean really, scrambled eggs for close to $10 just doesn't make any sense.\n\nScrutiny and suspicion aside, with so many breakfast choices out there Butterfield's isn't necessarily the best option, but if you're looking for a change up, this might be something different."
1,"I've been to many Mexican restaurants, some have been forgettable, some are consistently good, the majority are average. I've only been to Mi Pueblos twice, but I've had good results both times. Service is quick; drinks and chips were on the table within a couple of minutes. I had no problem getting in and out for lunch under thirty minutes. The chips were decent, neither stale or fresh out of the fryer, and the salsa was good. You can always tell how the quality of a restaurant's salsa is just by the way it looks and smells, Mi Pueblo's is properly chunky and has that distinct smell of fresh cilantro. They pass the test. I hate when Mexican restaurants have bland rice, it's almost as if you're chewing nothing at all. Luckily theirs has enough spice and salt to complement the entree. The burrito is large, tasty, and the meat quality is good. The building looks clean and it's easy to tell that the management upkeep the building well. Just about everything was great. What I didn't like was their guacamole dip, too me it had an off-putting taste, and their queso was a little bland. I'd also appreciate a little more variety on their menu. They have the staples covered, but once you've been to an authentic Mexican restaurant it's just hard to settle for anything less. Overall, it's easy to recommend Mi Pueblo's, the service is great and the food is good."
1,"I've been to Postino a countless number of times, and have never been disappointed by the food or the service.  The servers are always friendly and helpful, and the food (especially the small sandwiches and bruschetta) is delightful.\n\nIf you're thinking about going during happy hour or for dinner, I recommend calling ahead to make a reservation, or expect to wait.  It can get pretty packed."
1,"I recently moved to the Valley and was excited to spend my first Christmas with friends and flip flops. For lunch, we went to Jasmine Tokyo. It. Was. Awesome! They had a wide range of sushi and a nice selection on the buffet. It was overpriced, but it was Christmas. We left there to meet our friend Jim for snacks and cocktails. He wanted to do an \""early dinner\"".\n\nHe made reservations here. Good thing... Place was packed! I guess all Asian places were packed on Christmas. We weren't hungry, but had a few beers and ordered a few items on the limited menu. I read on Foursquare the chow mein was good. It comes with chicken, shrimp, and pork. The chicken was the highlight of the dish. VERY impressed with the flavor and the price point was average. Oh, and we ordered some spring rolls. The mustard is HOT. You've been warned. \n\nWe had a great time, and the service was great. Before you leave, head over to the bar and ask. It's not that bad. (You'll know what I mean.) I would highly recommend this place to friends and family!"
1,"My wife's Mini Cooper had to have its engine replaced. She no longer felt comfortable driving that car. We visited Nissan, Honda, Toyota and VW dealerships and ultimately had the best experience with Zimbrick VW in Middleton. Otto was very helpful. He was not pushy and gave us all the information we needed to make a decision.\n\nZimbrick made a very fair offer to trade in the Mini but we ended up selling it ourselves. Once my wife's car was sold, Otto made the process very quick and easy so we had her in her new Passat the same day. He even stayed after closing to walk her through setting up her new car!\n\nWhen I replace my Toyota RAV4, I will definitely consider Zimbrick VW."
0,"Cox is included in my rent so I am not really free to go elsewhere (or I would, I liked Dish network better). I got the bundle TV/Internet/Phone at a good price, the only think they don't tell you is you get the phone in the bundle, but you are charged when you use it, so i was stunned when i received my first bill as I was charged for $58 of phone calls. I called Cox and they did not want to do anything about it so I placed the issue in the hands of the BBB. Otherwise the TV guide is not very efficient, you can not check out only your favorite channels, and the guide screen is full of everything but the guide so you have to turn tens of pages to get where you want to go. they should cut the self-promotion to let customers use the service."
0,"Food was decent. Waiter was attentive. Music was a bit loud and I did not appreciate the people smoking cigars while I ate. I am sure its because they were \""making it rain\"" on the band performing. This restaurant would get 4 stars if it weren't for the cigar and cigarette smoke, which I think is against health code now. Probably won't go back unless it is to-go."
1,"Restaurants without windows should generally be avoided; however, I make an exception for Tokyo House. If you can get passed this structural oddity and cross their threshold (but I understand if you can't, I have a friend who refuses to eat lobster mac and cheese because he says putting seafood and cheese together is the single tackiest thing in existence) you'll be rewarded with not only a sizeable indoor koi pond, complete with a little bridge you have to cross to get to the seating, but also some seriously good Korean BBQ* (feel free to skip the sushi here).\n\nThe pork and beef--both were $15 and came with plenty of standard Korean BBQ sides--we ordered were coated in a spicy-sweet marinade, cooked up nice and juicy, and made a deliciously weighty base for our wraps. Our waitress (the master of great timing!) landed bowl after bowl of side refills on our table just as we were scraping the old ones. \n\nThe watermelon martini I ordered on a whim couldn't have been more out of place for the meal, but it was so good that I didn't care (sort of like the windows situation I mentioned above).\n\nKeep in mind that you're going to smell a little (a lot) garlicky after your meal, but I'd still take a date here; the smell is worth the adventure, and you can't say that about too many dining experiences. Plus, it's generally pretty empty so it's a good spot if you're looking to talk in a place that's private and quiet.\n\n*You have to call in advance and request the slatted grill, otherwise they'll give you one without holes, which is really more like a griddle and takes all the risk of dropping food into the fire below (READ: fun) out of cooking for yourself at your table."
0,"Called on 11/12/13 for an appointment set by Mike for 11/13 at 10 a.m., and this person did not show up nor did he call.  I called this business because their ad states that whoever represents this company is an Ahwatukee resident.  I hoped someone would show up promptly and quickly.  I am very disappointed in this company."
1,Same-day service and a great job done by Tony!  Can't complain!  $10 to replace the bottom of the heels on a pair of heels and Tony worked his magic in less than 2 hours for me.  I will be returning!
0,"My experience at this place has changed quite a bit the last two times I've been there.\n\nBoth times, the only free barber has been a guy at the very end. I know some people wait for their \""preferred\"" barber but I just take whoever is available because my cut is very simple. This guy is nice, but both times he's been sitting in his own barber chair eating a full-on meal when I walked in. So he'll set down his food nearby and start cutting hair, which seems kind of weird or unsanitary to me. Plus, I have to smell his food the whole time I'm sitting there. His station is also very unsanitary, with lots of other people's hair on the floor and even on the chair. It was quite noticeable when I was there on 11/16/2012. I guess I thought it was common for barbers to clean up their stations between customers.\n\nThe other barbers here are nice and professional, but unfortunately this guy is dragging the place down."
1,The porterhouse steak was just average but its topping and the side that made it! We had some kind of topping that wasnt on the menu...it was a asparagus lobster topping but it made that steak! The mushroom pot pie is an absolute must order!!\n\nOur waiter made all of his suggestions and made our dinner all the more delicious.\n\nThe restaurant is a little too loud for a Las Vegas steakhouse
1,"I just have to say that Jen, Cheree and Pharrah are my favorite ladies at this place! They are always happy and very efficient with their work. The other thing I like about them is that they always remember everything we talked about the previous session which always makes you feel really good!\n\nMy results have been great so far! This isn't my first experience with laser hair removal and this by far has shown more results then previous treatments at other spas. Im very happy overall with my experience so far!"
1,This is place is a must try if you are in Las Vegas. We always get the vanilla chocolate chip concrete when we stop by. I have nothing negative to say about this place. I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! =_
1,Not bad but not great.   So fav Asian on strip spot is still the one in venitian. \n\nGot the BBQ pork soup with wonton.  Good stuff if you are trying to shake that hangover. - 2 days in a row and the soup did the trick.. that means not a lot of MSG in there.. hmmm
1,"Love this place and love working here!  I like to go to local establishments as often as possible and this is the only coffee house in Old Town that I can find.  The staff is super-friendly and the atmosphere is great.  Couches, high-boys or tables to choose from and free wi-fi.  I highly recommend!\nThe only reason I give it 4 stars is the selection of coffees are not as varied as most, but they have the basics - smoothies, lattes, coffee and scones, etc."
1,"Talk about CHEAP prices for produce and meats!! When you go in for the first time you are going to see some things you (probably) have never seen before for sale in a grocery store in North Carolina. And you're going to find specials on things like limes, for instance: 7/$1 or sometimes even 12/$1! (yes you read that right!). Cilantro bunches are 3/$0.99!! Everything is much cheaper but it's also shipped in (which is why you can get cool produce like a Jack Fruit). I wouldn't buy any beer here since it's overpriced, but pretty much everything else is a good buy! The manager/owner is always there, and he is so pleasant! The store is neat and clean, the cashiers are multilingual and helpful."
0,"I think the problem might have been our expectations!  I went to dinner with my parents...none of us had been there.  We thought it was going to be like Lucille's...Maybe this is poor deduction skills on our part...BB King named his guitar Lucille so we thought the this was going to be like Lucille's in the Green Valley District.  We thought maybe the places had something to do with each other.  If they do, someone dropped the ball!  Lucille's never disappoints...Not the case with BB Kings.  \nWe had time to look at the menu and decide what we wanted before someone came to take our drink/food order.  It was minimum 35 minutes before we saw our food.  Really poor service.  She never came back to check on us.  No refills.  Once our food finally got there...the most helpful person working there was the food runner.  We never saw our waitress again until it was time to drop off the bill.  Then we thought she got lost because we didn't see her again for quite some time before we got our card back.\nAs far as the food goes...the sauce is good.  But you have to ask for an extra side of BBQ sauce.  There isn't a bottle on the table.  No extra flavors...only their house sauce.  My dad liked his ribs.  My mom and I split the chicken and ribs combo.  In my opinion, the chicken was dry and the ribs were too fatty.  Cornbread was pretty good though.\nThere is nightly music there.  It was a good band....however, it gets really loud in there.  Unless you are going specifically to listen to the music...don't go because you won't be able to have a conversation.  Unless you plan on yelling at each other!  Also another warning for people who may not know this...if you are at a restaurant while there is live entertainment, they can charge you entertainment tax, which is usually 18%.  Definitely adds to the bill.  My mom went to the gift shop to get a magnet...that $6 magnet was also charged with the 18% entertainment tax.  \nNot planning on going back...not worth the prices.  There's too plenty of other great places to eat at the Mirage, other Strip properties or local places."
1,Another wonderful dinner at this cute restaurant. We each had salads which were very good and huge. I had the LAMB BOLOGNESE and my wife had the whole trout. Both dishes were excellent. The restaurant wasn't very busy on a Sat night which amazes me. One of the better dining places in Pittsburgh.
0,This place has the worst service and sushi food. I have been to several places but this one takes the cake for being the worst. The waitress disappeared without coming back with the change. Unbelievable.
1,"Modena is a conveniently located med spa , with a friendly and welcoming staff . Dr. Yazdan is one of the nicest doctors I have met and truly experienced in his field. He will be my skin care specialist for a long time coming. Dr. Yazdan also does amazing hair transplants!"
0,"Food:\nAll three of us ordered different dishes, but all three tasted like they were cooking on an old greasy grill. Nothing to write home about.\n\nDecor:\nFriendly, neighborhood restaurant with comfy seating, comfortable lighting, and reasonable noise level.\n\nService:\nWait staff is attentive and informative, but not skilled at arithmetic.  Recommend that you add up your own bill."
1,"We used to visit ichabods at least once a week when you could get the best salad bar in town  for free with an entree.. Then the price went to $2.99, we still came because it was still the best in town.  Then it jumped to $3.99 and we noticed smaller portions and higher menu prices. . So we stopped coming. . After about 6 month or so we stopped last night as I was craving that salad bar.  I ordered the hot turkey $8.99 and my partner had the chicken parm sandwich. We then asked to add the salad bar and was told it was now $6.99 to add the bar to a sandwich. So, no salad bar for us.  You can only get the salad bar for $3.99. If you have an entree or order a special. The chicken parm was delicious,  a true winner.  My turkey, was a tiny scoop of mash and bread with a few turkey pieces. . While good, the portion was Def smaller than ever. . To say the least I think they probably have lost 3 customers for good,  and yes that salad bar was still looking good but, they took the soup away and now you have to order it from the kitchen instead of it being at the salad area."
0,Yuck.  Service and food both deplorable. \n\nHow do you make McDonalds worse than it already is?  Shove it inside a low budget casino and employ nothing but hood rats.  \n\nthe one star is for it being cheap and quick when hammered inside the Plaza.  At that point diarrhea really isn't a beg deal.
1,"Considering the number of Americans posting reviews, I was surprised to see that La Banquise was a charming neighborhood spot full of hungry locals, not just food-crazy tourists.  It's a smallish restaurant, and they're certainly economical about their use of space - no corner shall go unused.  Be prepared for a little bit of a squeeze, but everyone's in such a good mood that it doesn't matter.\n\nAside from 20+ varieties of poutine, they also have some diner favorites - burgers, omelettes, and salads.  But if diners' tables are any indication, seems like 90% of the clientele orders the poutine.  Had a tough time deciding between the Poutine Mart (hot dogs, bacon, and mushrooms) and the T-Rex (ground beef, pepperoni, bacon, and hot dogs)...but we were very happy to experience the Jaco (ground beef, onions, mushrooms, and peppercorn sauce) in all its gravy goodness.\n\nSee if you can snag a seat outdoors.  They can't serve alcohol outdoors, and you might be seated next to a smoker, but it's worth dining al fresco."
1,"We loved this restaurant on a recent trip to Montreal. In fact, we ate their 3 times on a five day trip!   I was surprised to find that this was one of several locations.  It has all the charm of small downtown BYOB, and delicious fresh baguettes served with quality Italian food."
0,"Spent over an hour looking for parking and going in circles around the block in traffic. Their lot was full so guy pointed to a garage a few blocks away. I'm spending $23 a day to park and had to walk 5 blocks thru homeless ppl to the hotel. Receptionist said I should have come in to ask about parking - great idea but I couldn't park the car to come in and ask!! Place is just ok, reminds me of college dorms. Will not be returning."
1,"Best bbq I have had in phoenix HANDS DOWN! Moist brisket is the business! Ribs, chicken, jalape\u00f1o links, potato salad, Mac n cheese, topped with that spicy bbq sauce and pickles and jalape\u00f1os on the side! With all that amazingness AND a great friendly staff how could you go wrong? Thanks for making my stomach happy time and time again!"
1,"This place was a saving grace for me. Being from out of town and being used to a plethora of Asian cuisine being everywhere, I  couldn't believe how there were so few authentic Chinese places. It's like there is a drought of authentic Chinese cuisine and thankfully this was the ONLY watering hole. Their string bean with garlic dish is always a go to dish along with the ox tongue and tripe. The double cooked pork was great. The spicy crispy chicken and beef brisket hot pot was definitely a favorite with the chicken just being spicy enough and succulent. And last but not least, the spicy crispy fish as well. I really hope this place thrives so if I ever have to come back, this will be my go to place to feel at home."
1,"We went for the Grand Opening party New Years Eve, so keep in mind this wasn't a typical clubbing experience. \n\n*The door/getting in - shockingly easy. They didnt' discriminate based on looks and we actually got in in a timely manner despite a long line. Perhaps this will change in the future, unfortunately. \n\n*Drinks/the bar - It was open bar so I can't comment on prices, but the bartenders were HOT and made a stiff drink. I might have blacked out for 2 hours that night.. damn you bartenders! \n\n*Layout/atmosphere - I would say it has a similar \""feel\"" to Lavo in that it's upstairs and small enough where you can see nearly the entire room from any vantage point. It is larger, however, than Lavo with a more defined dance floor. The dance floor has 2 sided video screens which is fun. I do not like, however, that there is no outdoor space like a balcony to go out onto. \n\nBottom line: Like it better than Lavo and Tao, but it can't compare to XS! Worth checking out if you're staying in city center."
1,"I ordered the Chipotle orange salad with blackened tilapia and it was so good! You can't beat the quickness and freshness for the price. And the people who run it are so nice. Will definitely be adding this to my new favorite \""fast food\"" rotation."
1,"This is my go to place in Vegas for tapas, specifically beef and seafood tapas! If you enjoy eating beef I would recommend the porterhouse as an entree. If you like lamb there is also an excellent lamb chop entree. As for seafood, Chilean Seabass is great! It has a nice flaky texture and rich in flavor. \n\nTheir sparkling sangria is also on point. \nIf you have a big appetite, I would recommend ordering the seafood paella! It takes 40 mins to cook so prepare to order early. Here is a list of what I ordered (group of 9) and what I think of each dish:\n\n1 large seafood paella - great for sharing, deep hearty flavor, the rice has a nice bite, they are able to accommodate for large groups and can make one big paella if needed \n2 duck forgras -excellent whole duck liver saut\u00e9ed to perfection and sandwiched between two baked apples, the sauce was a little too sweet for me, however the walnuts helped tone it down  \n2 beef and cheese - cooked medium rare \n2 calamari - crispy, not too chewy, fresh \n2 salmon cakes- hearty pieces if salmon\n2 lamb chop entrees - the white sauce has hints of truffle, great fat to meat ratio, fresh meat \n2 Atlantic cod- rich, fatty fish, chive oil was a nice combo \n1 Porterhouse - new to the menu, very tender, cooked medium rare \n1 beef tartar- excellent! Fresh raw beef with taro chips\n2 chicken skewers - has a nice char to it, meaty chunks of chicken"
1,"What could I say that hasn't been written about Kabuto over, and over again. If the overall Yelp rating isn't enough for you, and the Elite endorsements aren't either - keep on reading. But just so you know, you could save yourself the reading time and make a reservation now.\n\nMost sushi in Vegas is all-you-can-eat. Kabuto is the exact opposite of the very notion of food-to-money value. This is an experience. This is one of the rare places in the city that can bring you close to experiencing the taste and expertise of Japan. You're going to pay up to $120 for a designed and manicured experience, not including your drinks and extras. Be ready to see through the lens of the prideful sushi chef.\n\nImmediately, you may be confused where to find Kabuto. It is an unmarked door near Nakamura-Ya. Walk in. Do you see all white with some ovens? You're in Sweets Raku. Leave (but come back later). The other unmarked door. There you go. The place with the beautiful interior. Very Japanese in that the use of natural materials is prevalent. Wood. Stone. Simplicity. The food is being made right in front of the lucky customers sitting at the bar. Go ahead, take a picture.\n\nYour prix-fixe options are three. Basically, how much can you spend for how long of an experience? You can go up to $120, though I imagine the middle option is the most popular - which is what I had. It is plenty, but the higher tier is still appealing.\n\n1. You'll start with a drink. I had a Fuji apple infused sake, made in house, served over ice. Light and refreshing.\n2. Next, a small dish of sliced bonito, seaweed, and cucumbers. A tease for what is to come.\n3. Finally, a sashimi plate. Bluefin tuna, scallops, white fish, and oyster already with sauce. I'm usually the kind of person who tries everything on the plate - but avoid the stuff the oyster is sitting on. It's salt. Ask me how I know.\n4. Next, a grilled plate. Three pieces of meat. One fish I don't recall the name of but it was topped with a sort of miso. The next, beef tataki. Tender and delicious, wrapping some vegetables. The last, wild trout.\n5. Chopped bluefin tuna over rice. Simple and tasty.\n6. Marinated ikura over rice. I was initially afraid of the fishy aspect of this, but like all things perfected - I had nothing to fear. The bursts of ikura while chewing were salty but delicious in the mystery marinade and rice.\n7. A bluefin hand roll, but not of the conical variety. More like a small sushi roll but uncut. Simple, and still delicious. Appreciated familiarity.\n8. A series of nigiri. Some I don't remember, but I know there was cho-toro (medium fatty tuna). I also ordered extra young yellowtail and o-toro.\n9. When you're all done, you'll have a choice of miso soup with a variety of items. Fish bone, shrimp head, or seaweed (I think). I tried both the fish bone and the shrimp head. Both delicious and comforting ends to the \""sushi phase.\""\n10. Dessert. I got to try the roasted tea ice cream and the citrus sorbet. Both excellent, particularly the sorbet. Extremely refreshing and flavorful.\n\nFor a high-end sushi experience, you will probably never find better in Vegas. This isn't a place to get value, or to get full. This is an experience. Remember this. Eat slowly. Take the time to think about what you're eating. Enjoy."
1,"This place is amazing! Prepare to get messy (don't worry they will give you a bib and gloves)!  The food was awesome and cooked to perfection! I was shocked at the size of the shrimp! \n\nThank you for taking care of us, Jesse! Can't wait to go back!"
1,"A unique park-like setting, located at the back of a modest farm.  Many lovely things to look at while you wait.  The brunch is served very casually, on paper plates, which seems strange for what is essentially gourmet food, but maybe it keeps the costs down."
0,"Wow..... Kinda sucked! I have no idea why so many others gave such good reviews?\n\n The theater was as big as a frigging 7/11... Ok I am exaggerating a little but it was tiny comparatively.  The singing was horrible. Whoever told the main chick she could sing was smoking something good and probably a family member or something. Then half way through the show a dude comes out and starts telling jokes?! WTF \n\n1 of the chicks looked like a dude.... and 2 others were kinda chubby. This is Vegas baby! You have to be cream of the crop to dance here! No sloppy chicks! Please Save your money! For a couple extra bucks go see a real show in a real theater \""Peep Show\"" at the MGM.\n\nOh yeah they don't have a restroom in the theater so make sure you go before you get there.\n\nDino...)'("
1,"I live within walking distance to Ed's and I haven't been there too often; however, I have become a sucker for their wings.  I love their Blackened Parm. wings.  Such a great flavor and their ranch dressing is just yummy!  Whenever I'm craving wings, I head to Ed's!"
0,"I have been a member for over two years. I used to be in love with this place and go practice religiously but now things have definitely changed....for the worst! Most instructors that I love have quit or been let go in the recent months due to their pays being cut or other personal issues with the owner King, showers are disgusting and never any soap now, there are tacky hand written signs to tip instructors $2-$3 per class, the schedule is definitely not what it is used to be. The owner has been greedy and selfish & careless towards his staff and especially the members that paid to attend! My contract ends in a couple months....and I will NOT renew. I have recommend this place to so many friends and co-workers & absolutely regret it. I feel terrible for all the people who I refereed that purchased year contracts!!! It WAS an amazing place :("
1,"If I could, I guess I would go with 4 1/2 stars? \n\nI came to Vegas for my best friend and my birthday.  We wanted to go to a nice restaurant and ultimately selected RM Seafood.\n\nFirst, 3 out of 4 of us are Top Chef fans and were excited to meet Rick Moonen and chat with him.  He's a very nice man and we talked about the food.  He spent a lot of time on the floor...only thing about that that concerns me is that I know he's a celebrity chef and all, but I hope he had a hand in the food that night.\n\nTwo of us did the prix fixe and two of us didn't.  We ate:\n\nAppetizers:\n-California roll with real crab (mine)\n-Steak tartare with fries\n-Ahi Tuna two ways\n\nMy california roll was better than a typical california roll (with fake crab), but none the less it was a ...california roll. The steak tartare looked excellent and I was told that and the tuna both were.\n\nMain course:\n-Lemon-butter scallops and shrimp with capers\n-Halibut with basil sauce\n-Cioppino (mine)\n\nAll three were delicious!  The halibut was the best...love the clean flavors...the green.  Scallops were seared to perfection.  The cioppino was the weakest of a very strong pool.\n\nDessert:\n-16 flavor ice cream challenge\n-Key lime pie\n\nWe were so full by the time we got to dessert, but hey, how many more times am I going to come?  We had to do the ice cream challenge! We got about 10 correct.  According to the waiter, the average correct is 8.  This was more about the experience as some of the ice cream flavors were truly disgusting.  haha.  We had a great time though.\n\nThe waiter also brought out a little candle with the ice cream for our birthdays! (They didn't sing, which I wouldn't expect or want in a joint like this so it was just right. :) )\n\nI'm not usually a key lime pie fan, but this one was probably the best key lime pie I've ever had.  \n\nThe bill wasn't as unreasonable as some of the other restaurants in Vegas (we also didn't drink though).\n\nAll in all, it was a great experience and perfect low-key moment to a crazed Vegas trip.  I would recommend this restaurant to a seafood loving fan looking for a good, not-outrageously priced but still nice meal for their Las Vegas trip."
0,"Food was ok, a bit overpriced, but it was in the casino. But the service took forever for coffee, over 20 minutes to get the bill after asking for it. stick with the basics, oatmeal, french toast, dont try anything fancy because they don't do it well."
1,So nice to have a sprouts nearby now. Great selection of produce and meats. Can't beat the already prepared meals for price and convenience.
0,I had been coming here since it seems like 2003 or so and for 4 years or so had been consistently delighted with the food - they were always too-crowded and service/wait times consistently showed that strain. \n\nI've stopped coming here - preparation and ingredient quality have diminished steadily since late 2007 and crossed a boundary for me by November 2008
0,This Thai place used to be my favorite thai in the valley until it changed ownership. After the it went down the drain. I used to give it 5 stars. The old owner opened up Bola Thai in Mesa which is my new fav!
0,"Prime was not.\n\nIt was not yummy. It was not inexpensive. It did not refill soda drinks. It had no other customers.  The lady who met us at the front was expecting us to get take out. Why? There were plenty of tables and it was clean. \n\nWe stayed, we ordered Hot Thai Soup, House chicken, House seafood, lemonade, soda and Thai tea with cream. The rice was a very small portion, the seafood was inedible, because the garlic sauce was like mucus and tasted off, not worth $16 for sure!  The chicken was like it had sat on a buffet for hours and I'm not sure what they made the sauce out of, it wasn't to our liking. The soup tasted of mustard not lemongrass and chili or coconut or what you might expect from a Thai hot soup. Thai Rama, Malee's...others have better soup.\n\nI expected a lot better from the reviews. I understand why it's empty now and I'm surprised it's been here so long. It's only because they handled the order fine, service was fine and the place is clean that they got 2 stars. \n\nI would not try them again for food, unless i got really desperate and too lazy to drive farther than their location which is really close to home. I'll probably try the China Buffett down the street before I return to Prime. Very disappointing."
0,"The food is good - typical of any Paradise Bakery. Good breads, meats, salads and the cookies.\n  The facility is great, but parking is horrible.\n  The reason for the low score is the staff. It seemed like they were all moving under water. The sandwich guy may have been the slowest person I've ever seen. Lethargic would be a good description."
0,"The owner was extremely rude. He was talking on his cell phone while closing out a customer. Also, with me personally, he was unprofessional about taking down my information (is it me, or why is personal information relevant if all I'm getting is a smog check?), claiming it was the \""law\"" for him to take it down. Then, he had the nerve to tell me when I was going to pay that it would be an extra $2 if I wanted to pay with my debit card, when he had no such statement posted ANYWHERE in the place. I told him it was the LAW for him to have something posted and that he couldn't just spring that on people at the time of payment. Thankfully, he didn't charge me, but then proceeded to distastefully throw my final paperwork at me. I would NEVER go here again, even for the cheap $10 smog. I don't understand how this place is even in business with customer service like that!"
1,Great friendly place. I'm usually very picky about people cutting my hair. Went to this place on a recommendation of my brother in law and Yelp and I wasn't disappointed. \nI recently relocated from NYC and this was the first and last barber shop I will experience here. I won't go anywhere else now.\nCody (sp) was a very easy going guy. A good conversation a good cut and shave.\n\nTreat yourself and get the executive package it was awesome!

1,Great Japanese cuisine with a kiss menu and premium sushi.  The presentation of all dishes are artistically done.  If you are in for lunch I recommend the Kabuki Deluxe and Omkase Delux for starters.
1,"I like the fact that they clean your fish and fry it to your liking. The fish use to be better quality, its a hit or miss nowadays, ten years ago was a different story, good stuff back then!"
0,food poisoning from a medium rare hamburger. 'nuff said.\n\nexcuse me while i go visit the porcelain god again. ugh.
1,Best Italian restaurant anywhere!  The salad is to die for!  The menu has a very nice mix of choices.  Prices are very reasonable.  Atmosphere is very nice.  Staff is friendly and responsive.
0,"If I could give no stars I would. This is the first time I have been to Danny's in 5-6 years because last time at another location around the corner my iPod was taken from my console. I noticed immediately because there was radio static playing when I got In my car. I call manager, I called police. Everyone said same thing, \""sorry sir, there is nothing we can do.\"" Well, this time I go out of desperation and again \""they\"" (anonymous  dirtbag) rife led through found my wife's wallet and removed all the $190 that was inside. I will NEVER go to another Damny's in all my days. I suggest you do the same."
0,Eh. I don't love this food store. It smells pretty bad. It also doesn't seem like it has the best selection of anything. There are no scallops either. Plus they don't de-bone their salmon.
1,"I love this bar!!! Its some where between a dive and trendy spot. Its dark, has plenty of tables and chairs, great local beers on tap, friendly service and good food. When we go we definitely make sure to arrive on an empty stomach, since the duck here is amazingly good and unique! For 12 bucks you get 6 duck legs prepared kind of like fried chicken, alongside an arugula salad, some fantastic french fries with 2  delicious creamy dipping sauces! My mouth is watering just writing this! Follow up this delicious meal with a perfectly poured pint of their IPA. Bliss!"
1,"GREAT selection of bottled beer. Not that many drafts to choose from, but still a pretty good selection. Our bartender, Ashley was very nice! We could sample any of the draft beers before purchasing which made us feel more comfortable. Prices were reasonable as well."
1,One word: YUM.
0,"I stopped by this place on Monday October 12, 2009. It is closed forever as Jack's Grill.\nThe new owner was inside remodeling.  He claims to be reopening by 10/14/09 under a new name of \""Holy Land\"" restaurant."
1,"Every time I come to Vegas, I visit Tao and am never disappointed.\n\nThis time my husband and I were celebrating my birthday and got bottle service in the hip hop room.\nWe had a great time!\n\nWhy 4 stars...\nWhen we arrived it took almost 20 min for the cocktail waitress to get our bottle of Hen and our mixers.\nOne of the drunk ass guys at the table next to us almost knocked down our bottle of Hen and did knock down one of our mixers all over the floor. Lucky for him not on my shoes!!!\nAnd the rope that was supposed to protect us and our alcohol... kept getting knocked down, people were trying to hop over, and there was no security in sight."
1,Very nice hotel - check in was easy and the hotel itself is relatively new.  My room is very nice with a view of las Vegas - it is a long distance view because this hotel is so far away from the strip it seems you are in California almost.  I went to the all you can eat sushi bar which came with sake for $25.00 and it was excellent.
1,Bloom is the best!!!\n\nBest prices in Pittsburgh!\nMost beautiful spa setting!\nKerri is the best ever! She really took the time to get to know me and what exactly my skin needs. She's professional and sweet! And the skin services are amazing and relaxing! I feel soooo good after my appointments!!\n\nI can't wait for my next appointment!! :-)
0,"Does anyone in Madison consider this a great Mexican food location? Both of my experiences at Pedro's have left me disheartened. They go a little something like this:\n\n1. Thursday night. Friends invite me for inexpensive margaritas. Am   approached by a girl who wants me to go out with her father standing 10 feet away, who ironically is the least creepy of the crowd looking to enjoy cheap tequila. Implementing Gym Rules, i.e. baseball cap and hoodie upon my next visit post 9pm.\n\n2. Wednesday evening. Dinner with a friend. Server who may or may not go on living if she stops texting, poor quality food and terrible lighting, which is imperative unless practicing G.R. (see above.)\n\nBeing a girl from the southwest, I have had a great fajita or two in my day. If you are feeling rebellious and decide to go despite the many poor reviews, know this: Mexican food is great, and this is nowhere near that."
1,The best breakfast I have ever had. Amazing french toast.  Large slices of bread that are crispy on the outside and doughy-rich on the inside. Covered with like two cups of just-softened blueberries and a large dollop of freshly whipped cream. Pour the warm blueberry syrup over it all. Heaven.  Attentive service. Seemed like they refilled our coffee every 90 seconds.  Cute atmosphere -- the atrium is light and airy. It seems like a French bistro on Las Vegas steroids.
0,The Duce is a disaster. \nAs an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown. I wanted to love this place. The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service. The parking is atrocious. It's as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food. They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing. \nHowever I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night. We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce. Management needs to wake up. Great concept. Horrific customer service and staff.
0,"My husband and I tried the 2 six dish tasting menus (the signature tasting menu and the Peking duck tasting menu). Doing the tasting hopefully gets us a wide variety of dishes to sample as well as trying what the restaurant is most proud of. The first two courses of each were excellent - vegetable dim sum and a tofu and crab cake and Peking duck on traditional buns and a duck salad with truffle vinaigrette. However, after that the quality went down hill dramatically. The duck menu had a greasy lo mein main dish that was no higher quality than any lo mein you get at your local restaurant and one dessert was just chocolate mousse (at a Michelin star Asian restaurant?!). \n\nThe service in general was good but as the meal went on and the restaurant became more busy they became less and less attentive. The general atmosphere was nice, especially if you can get a table by the garden, however of the 4 chairs at our table, 2 had pieces missing and creaked uneasily. I would rate the place higher if it weren't so expensive. If you're spending that much money go to a place with better overall food."
1,"Went in here on a whim since its close to home to get some dog food. After asking me questions about my dogs and our lifestyle they recommended a food and WOW! What a difference in my labs! Their coats are nicer, have gotten leaner muscle mass and definitely a lot less poop to clean up (yay!). The prices are competitive with the large box stores, which honestly, surprised me. I get my cat food here now as well and I swear, my cat has gotten bigger. Not fatter, just bigger. And she's 5. The staff are super friendly and knowledgable and I love supporting a small local business when it deserves to have my money."
1,"This place has great character. I've been here at least 5 times, and I've only lived here for 2 weeks!"
1,I love this place! If you create tour own and it's good they put it on the menu. The Christmas music random on shuffle is strange in July but it goes with the atmosphere.
1,"Okay, this was recommended by a friend who had their holiday party catered upstairs. I was not expecting BEST WINGS EVER!!!!! It is a hipster place with TONS of seating and great burgers and wings. This is what I know of it so far. They have private room for parties, LOTS of craft brews of every sort.  Bike and car parking (unlike Four Peaks). \n\nThis is not \""upscale\"" it is very relaxed, calming and the food is the same, nothing hugely complicated but lots to choose from. Wings are standard buffalo, (see pic), we ordered some of differing heat and none were beyond medium for my taste. I like them hotter but the meat was cooked properly and they were crispy. \n\nYou can also sit outside with the out of control misters.  It's good for your lungs, like a humidifier in the outdoors. I will highly recommend this place for happy hour, which is every hour."
1,"Recently joined the YMCA and this is my \""home\"" ymca.  I LOVE the equipment and 'most' of the staff.  I have hit the gym (been a member about 30 days) at very varied times but have settled on 5 am for strength training (mon/wed/fri) and 3pm (ish) for cardio (Tues/Thurs/Sat).  At either time it isn't overwhelmingly crowded.\n\nI will say at 5 am (and I assume other times) there are plenty of meat heads in the weight room - grunting, slamming weights, flexing in the mirror.  I also  find it entertaining to see the fashion show that occurs in the weight room (I like to ppl watch between sets).   I have NEVER seen so many coordinated work clothes in my entire life.  Matching shows, pants/shorts/shirts and often times hats.  None of this bothers me, it is just entertaining.\n\nI have not met anyone very friendly there and I assume that is because it is the \""SoPark\"" area - but since I don't go to the gym to socialize I guess it doesn't matter."
0,"Really bad  customer service.On 1/08/15 me and my wife visited Walmart. Everything was fine until we got to the register where unpleasant& very rude cashier Sandy \""helped\"" us.One of the items in our grocery cart was tangerines that she rang up at 0.58cents a piece (10 pieces total)where the correct price was 0.58cents per pound so after seeing the price for 10pieces of tangerines ($6.80cents)I brought up to her attention that the price was wrong so instead of her calling for a price check she went off on me and said :\""well this is the price that they ring up\"" so I told her again that the price is wrong because it's per pound not per piece& I asked her to check the price herself which she just rolled her eyes and ignored it so at this point I told her that I don't want them anymore (there's a longer story to that but just trying to keep it short)We bought close to $200 in groceries and I wanted to do a multi payment and that's where she got very upset at me and my wife like that option wasn't allowed lol so I told her I want X amount on one card and the rest on the other card and she went off on me AGAIN.Me and my wife got literally shocked and confused as why she is making a problem for us to do a multi payment and was acting all crazy and rude to us and next thing I hear is her trying to call the manager on me lol  (I have to be honest tho- this is very first time ever that employee of a store tried to call the manager on me :D ) I shop at this Walmart for few years now and never had a problem before until today...Time to change Stores I guess because their employees at night shifts have some really nasty attitudes."
0,"Bought the groupon for exam, X-rays, and 3 adjustments.  Mind you, until now i was completely uneducated on chiropractors and assumed i was buying 3 actual adjustments... you know, where you can hear and feel the difference.  Setting the appointment was quick, easy and friendly. \nAt the first appointment the office staff and doctor seemed a little 'too friendly'.  We (my spouse, daughter and I) waited for a while then were all escorted to a room to watch a video.  The video was of testimonials saying how awesome this new NUCCA chiropractic treatment was.  \nAfter more waiting the doc came in, told my spouse (who I bought the groupon for) to get on this scale that weighs each side of your body.  Wow, he was 20 pounds heavier on his right side.  Then the doc took X-rays and told us to set another appointment for the adjustment, which would give them time to evaluate the X-rays.  \nSo we set an appt for the next morning.  After some more waiting we were escorted to the room to watch another video of all the NUCCA believers testimonials.  While we were waiting in there both my daughter and I stepped on the scale.. Hey you guessed it.. We were both 20 pounds heavier on our right sides.. Not to mention my daughter is only 6 years old lol.\nSo doc comes in \""I have good news and bad news.. The bad news is that your spine is pretty messed up.. Good news is I think our treatments will help you!\"" \nThen he presents us a paper with the pricing on the 8 weeks of treatment he recommended to 'get better' $2100.. \""But if you pay up front it's only $1700.\"" \nBy then we already knew we wasted the $45 on the groupon.  So finally time for the \""adjustment\"".  The doc literally rubbed my spouses neck with pressure lighter then my 6 year old would apply for about 25 seconds.\nNow to not continue to bore you with a pretty lame experience, it seems all they want is your money.  The adjustment did absolutely nothing to my spouse.  We no call no showed the last 2 appts and feel good about it.. Lol.  \nHopefully this review saves some others from wasting their time and money on something that is truly \""all in your mind\"".\nOn a good note for the company, while we waited and waited those 2 days, there were a lot of patients signing in to get their \""adjustments\"".   So for some, the mind funk obviously works. . . But if you want to feel a difference I say make sure you're going to a real back cracking body rubbing fair priced chiropractor.\nThanks for reading ;)"
1,This is by far the friendliest IHOP I have visited.  The managers are on top of the service. I was trapped in town due to weather and had dinner and breakfast here. Great value and service.
0,"We went in there on Sunday for lunch, it was packed-well the foyer was at least. After sitting there for ten minutes we were led to a dinig area that was maybe 1/3 full of customers. I was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess. There was one person taking names, another checking the names, two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room. Christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and I'm hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice. So my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner!  The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time. I would love for it to be another 10 years (or more) until I eat here again....glad I wasn't paying for it!"
1,Hands down the best sushi in Scottsdale!  No need to ever go to Stingray again!  Especially since it is walking distance from my home!
0,"Mixed reviews for sure.  I've been here a few times, for various events and the only thing that has remained constant is BAD SERVICE.    Why would someone invest so much money to open a restaurant and then ruin it by hiring a bunch of idiots, who are Sloooooow and don't give a shit.   It baffles me.   \nAlot of people on here have dissed the decor,  but honestly I don't care about what it looks like if the food and service were good.\nMost of the food has been too spicy for me, but there are a couple of dishes that I LOVE (hence the 2 starts versus 1) \nThe melted cheese and  chorizo appetizer is delish along with the soft tortillas they serve it with.  And the Lolitas Rice is a very good blend of rice and beans.  The little bean dip they serve with the chips is good too.\n\nas for the drinks, hard to say.  last time I went they were out of both ice tea and lemondade in the middle of the day.  The margaritas i've had there have only been OK, nothing special.\n\nthe last time we went there was a party of 12.  they added 18% tip to our bill, which was good for the lazy slow waitress since we would have left her only a lump of coal. \n\nI honnestly hope they get it together, because the location is great.  Step it up people before you loose your investment due to an uncaring staff."
0,"If you like expensive, fatty BBQ, then is the place for you. \nAfter reading all of the gushing reviews for Little Miss, we decided to give it a try. We were third in line and the 25 minute wait wasn't bad. When we got inside the place, my wife looked at the menu board and went \""Oh No\"". The prices were quite high, a two meat plate with tax was over 16 bucks $16.00+. We both ordered lean brisket and a rib plus 2 sides. \nTo be fair, both the brisket and rib was tender but since they wrap the brisket and ribs in either butchers paper or aluminum foil and put them in a warming oven before carving, a leather boot would be tender. \nBoth cuts were loaded with fat. I do not mind some marbling on my BBQ but this was over the top with fat. The meat itself was bland. No slight flavor from the dry rub or the hardwood.  Personally, a bit of crusty bark on \""Q\"" does a lot for the flavor.\nLittle Miss is a step above, Rudy's, Honey Bears, Dave's and Can't Stop Smokin BBQ but price wise any of those places are a better money value.\nWould I return to Little Miss BBQ? No!"
1,Love coming here after a long day of work! So relaxing snd foods great as well. Very clean too
1,"This bar is the shit, probably my favorite in Phoenix. Great drinks, great people and great art! I could go off on how great it is but I'm not going to... JUST GO THERE! Tonight.. NO.. RIGHT NOW haha\n\nP.S order the Leffe, its a great beer"
0,"I'm not sure why this place has gotten so many 5 star reviews--it is truly a mystery.  I actually found this place on yelp and thought it would be as the reviews indicate but was sorely disappointed.  At first I was sold by the fact that they went over my car with a fine tooth comb and gave me a breakdown of problem areas.  The problem was that this list didn't indicate prices or prioritize the work needed.  So, when I spoke to Bogi she recommended what should be done first and verbally quoted a price between $600-$800.  This is what I had planned to pay.  From the looks of it most people who have work done here drive Lexus, BMW but I am not a person of means -- the reason I'm going here based on yelp reviews that say she is fair priced.  When I went to pick up my car the bill was $1300 and not even a blink from her!  I was shocked and told her so!  She never informed me at any time in the process (she had my car for over a week) that it would cost any more that I was initially quoted!  Isn't this against the law?  Then, to boot, ever since I drove my car off her lot my airbag light is on and I have no horn.  I would go back to have it fixed but quite honestly I'm afraid I'll get stuck paying even more.  This place is a RIP OFF-- STEER CLEAR (no pun intended),"
0,"Husband and I ordered a late breakfast. He had belgian waffle breakfast, I has the corned beef hash. \nThe bad: Corned beef hash was nothing special, tasted like the stuff you get out out a can. My hash browns were blond, rather firm, and possibly starting to turn bad... They had that slightly-off taste. My husband's scrambled eggs were watery (not runny, but surrounded by liquid). The belgian waffle was also cold by the time it came out... It had obviously sat in the window for a while while my food was bring prepared. \nThe good: fresh, hot coffee (they left the thermos pot on the table, which was nice), sausage links were fine, waffle was fine, my food was piping hot when it came out. \nThe total came to $26, which is more than the meal was worth, considering the poor quality of the breakfast food."
1,"I love this place. They have a very friendly and helpful staff and their coffee and beer are equally wonderful! \n\nI played at their Wednesday night \""open stage\"" and I was pleasantly surprised. The scene was very relaxed, inviting, and friendly. I will be back next Wednesday!"
0,"I live downtown and was sooooo excited that we had yet another restaurant to visit..... especially since it is the same owner as AZ88 which I love!  \n\nWent for lunch with my bf and we both started out with a martini.  Mine had St. Germain in it and I couldn't wait!  We waited... and waited.... they finally came and wow... they were in miniature glasses.  Not so happy about the size.  When you order a martini... it should be in a standard martini glass.  They were tasty though, so we ordered a sandwich and a margarita pizza.  Meanwhile, a table of 4 sat down about 5 minutes after us.  Later when the server finally came with their wine bottle and 4 glasses they had already left.  The table next to us told the waitress \""I guess they got tired of waiting\"". \n\nAll in all, the food was average, pleasant decor, however, the service needs work.  I look forward to giving Hanny's another shot but will wait a couple of months."
1,"absolutely delicious! family owned, the entire staff is very friendly!"
1,"First of all, I've been a Yelp lurker for years... I had an experience tonight that compels me to write.  Felt in the mood for some Cibo pizza on my home to SoPho from a downtown Phoenix client ... was guided by the awesome female bartender towards the Diavlo pizza with added ricotta (something different from my standby Margarita pizza ... she didn't steer me wrong).  As I tend to do ... stopped by on my way home with novel in hand, ordered a dry white and a pizza to go.  The serene hum of this sweet little place was broken up by a nice older, very clean, but obviously mentally challenged man.  He walked in and loudly asked what was on the menu ... wanted a loaded pizza and a beer in this upscale downtown restaurant.  The owner gave him his utmost attention and ordered him the pizza with his toppings of choice, and a beer. I'm sorry I didn't get the owner's name, but his attentiveness and kindness endeared me even more to this place.  This diverse downtown environment may scare some away ... but I just love the energy of people helping people.  Oh, and the pizza at this place is to die for!  Can't wait to try Pasta Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which I just learned about while I was waiting."
1,"This is a really cool new place.  My wife, 4 yr old daughter along with two friends hit it up this morning after  charity walk at Fremont St.  We were seated immediately, brought our drinks and promptly ordered. \n\nAll five of us ordered something different, and everything was fantastic. I had the Chili Omlette, it was great. Wife had Dunkin Pancakes (I think that is what they were called) and she enjoyed them. Our daughter ordered the Apple doughnuts and they were amazing! Can't recall what the friends ordered but they both had nice things to say.\n\nIt was a tad pricey ($75 for 4 plus child) but I will return.  The entire menu was loaded with stuff. I would like to try."
0,Front office staff was rude and condescending because we wanted to check in early.\n\nFriends of ours showed up after we did and yet they received their rooms. We waited 3 hours for our room.
0,"A large group of us made a dinner reservation a month prior, and was told upon being stuck in the corner with two crates for tables that they only take \""requests.\""  The owner came over only to blatantly refuse to take responsibility for the misrepresentation on his restaurant's part and rudely interrupt our attempt to resolve the issue with, \""I own other restaurants.\""  \n\nI have never seen such a mistreatment--not even in the snobby town of Scottsdale (no offense, people of Scottsdale).\n  \nIt was unfortunate, because the waitress (whose section we were sitting while making plans to move our night) was sweet."
0,"I hate the fact that I have to give this place such a low rating. Many aspects of it kick ass. I came to Vegas 9/25/13  for my honeymoon and spent my last night at the D. At check in I specifically asked for a nice room and would pay more. What they gave me was a room that was standard and next to the stage outside that blared music until late into the night. After complaints, we were moved to a better room that was quieter. Needless to say, we love old Vegas  but will stay somewhere else next time"
1,"Wahoo!  They have a location in Vegas!!  I used to be a regular in various locations around SoCal... so when a friend mentioned this place recently opening up... I had to pay this place a visit.  Unfortunately it's location is a bit obscure... you wouldn't really run into it randomly unless you live in the area.  Google it and try it out.\n\nI like the fish tacos and the maui bowl... but mix it up and find your favorites, there's plenty to choose from.  If you can't decide, let the bartender or server order for you :)  \n\nThey've got video poker machines at the bar as well as Thirsty Thursdays! (1/2 off draft beers...Sam Adams please.  Always a good choice...)"
1,"This place gets a solid 5 stars for the atmosphere and history. The live rock music also gets this place onto my list of favorites. From the decor to the bar specials, so many things here make Long Wong's a Valley icon.\nThat said, the food is really good too. The burgers, wraps, subs, and hot dogs are all around the 4 star mark, with only some of their offerings being truly noteworthy. Sadly, no matter how much they advertise, the wings here are at the most 3 stars. I LOVE CHICKEN WINGS (What a Sommelier is to fine wine, I am to chicken wings). Unfortunately, these wings are nothing special. A few of the flavors are admittedly delicious, but most are barely decent. The quality of the wings kill it; they are small, fatty, stringy, and covered in too much batter and gooey sauce. Also, the worst lemonade I've ever had at a restaurant.\nMost all of the food here is pretty darn good, and for a night at a bar or a bumping concert, the food psychologically turns exceptional. But in the sobering light of day, the food here is nothing special. Pay homage to what this place is, what it was, and what it stands for. It's a fun relic with good food and great music... still doesn't mean it's the best place out there to go out to eat."
0,"Sorry, but something must have happened to this place since Ellen J. and Monica B. wrote their reviews.  My girlfriend and I went there tonight for our monthly sushi fix and to catch up.  It was nice to have it so quiet - we were the only ones in the restaurant for an hour - but we understand why.  The service was attentive but the food was poor.  The portions are small - you get twice as much at most other places for the same price - the happy hour offered nothing of interest - and they do not have a full bar as is listed - only beer and wine.  Imitation crabmeat?  Sorry - that's just not authentic fare and definitely not serious sushi.   We were very disappointed.  Fortunately the conversation was good!  But we won't be back here again."
0,I'm getting married next month and have been in this store twice. One thing I didn't like is I didn't have anyone dedicated to my service of renting a tux. As the groom it's one of my most important days of my life. \nI didn't see quality of experience and knowledge in sales Not enough opinions or help while trying suit. \nI pick up next month for my wedding. I surely hope this experience is better for us.
0,"They call themselves \""fine dining\"".  I'm not sure I agree with that.  The atmosphere is dull at best.  We went during lunch and had to wait for a table to be cleared (but the restaurant was not even half occupied).  The guacamole was the best thing we ate, though under seasoned.  In fact, all of the food was extremely under seasoned.  Because it was \""fine dining\"" there was no salt or pepper on the tables.  It was very much needed.The house margarita tasted similar to pine sol.  All in all, not a good experience.  I do not think I will be going back to this place."
0,"WOW service was bad... That is the waiter was awesome, the kitchen sucked in getting us our food. Although most all the food was good, some was less the good. The cocktails were delish. The restaurant was really beautiful, but strange for the area! I do not think they will be open much longer.... Sad..."
0,"The best thing about this Albertsons is that it makes you feel like your life isn't so bad.  The various crackheads, meth addicts and other true Las Vegas characters that seem to inhabit this location make it seem like a tour of what your life could be if you didn't stay away from meth..."
1,"I came here with a group of 5 girls celebrating a birthday on a Friday night, and I had a great time here. The bar wasn't too crowded around 9:30, and we were able to sit and hang out. \n\nThe reason why we went here at all was because I am a fan of Drinking Made Easy, and in their Charlotte episode they came to Prohibition and got 2 drinks: One called a Chocolate Covered Strawberry shot, and the other was called American pie martini. \n\nWhen we got there, we were served by the bartender in the show! I was so excited, but tried to not be a huge dork (I may have only marginally succeeded). She made us the chocolate covered strawberry which includes strawberry moonshine, and was quite a large shot. None of us could take it down in one go at it. We also had the American pie, which is made with whipped cream vodka, and it was delish as well, although she told us she was out of the crushed graham cracker crumbs that normally rim the glass. \n\nOverall, great experience, I would definitely recommend. If you get there before 10:30, no cover!"
1,"With all of the great reviews that I read before I came here I definitely had high expectations and they were exceeded! \n\nWe started with the large Salumi board and even though it was just the two of us I was glad that we got it because we were able to try all of the different varieties of cured meats.  I was particularly fond of the lardo and the duck speck (possibly proscuitto).  \nI was hoping for a duck entree, but since none were available we decided to split the squab and pork belly, and boy was I glad that we did.  They split the entree for us without us requesting and even split I thought that the portion was good after the Salumi board.  The squab was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the pork belly was delicious.  My husband and I continue to disagree on this fact, but my favorite was the squab.  The entree was accompanied by grilled romaine lettuce, cornbread, and corn pudding.  \nFor dessert we shared the cheese platter and the chocolate souffle cake.  Both were good, but I really didn't notice after the amazing entree. \n\nI will definitely be back and can't wait to try some new things!"
1,"Tried foosia while trying to find healthy \""clean\"" food and we weren't disappointed. Love this place!  It is similar to chipotle meeting Asian stirfry. Everything looked and tasted delicious.  Great customer service too. I also enjoyed having no caffeine and no sugar fruit ice tea. So many times it is loaded with caffeine and sugar. I wish California had a few of these, I would eat there all the time.  Foosia we will be back!"
0,"Despicable! \n\nI pre-paid for a table at The Bank through Vegas.com. My reservation included 2 bottles of champagne and 2 bottles of Vodka. When I contacted the club 2 days before the event, I was told that my reservation was not being honored. They would sit us at the busy bar instead. For anyone who has been out to clubs in Vegas, you know that's not the same kind of experience. Not even close. \n\nI had even emailed their Director of Social Media and the same guy who responds to all these Yelp reviews - with my concerns about the reservation. He assured me that the reservation would be honored and to just show up at the club on time. Then I speak with their head VIP host - who tells me I'm SOL. They don't care that I've already paid for a table and bottles... they won't be honoring it. He had no concern for the way that makes his business look. \n\nI called Vegas.com to explain the dilemma and they called The Bank directly. Nothing changed. The Bank still says it's a no-go. The lesson learned here is that nobody at this club can be trusted. When their Director of Social Media can promise a customer one thing only to have the club disregard it completely despite having prepaid for the reservation... it's just absolutely reprehensible. \n\nThere's not a lot we can do to affect these clubs. The supply and demand curve is just so out of wack in this industry that the clubs can do whatever they want, treat you however they'd like, and charge you 20x cost just because! But we have to keep trying to make companies treat customers with respect. I strongly urge everyone who reads this to share this story with anyone they know who might be considering this club. There are other more honest clubs in Vegas that deserve your money. Don't give it to one that will toss you to the side the second a bigger opportunity comes around! \n\nUpdate 5/29 - after the trip:\nThe Bank continued to give me the run around... so we went with Donnie E. at Tao and dropped 5 G's on a prime table on their stage with a perfect view of Snoop and Busta Rhymes performing all night long. Whatever you do, just stay away from the Bank and the shady criminals who run it!"

1,"The Omni Charlotte is an immaculate luxury hotel that totally provides the Omni standard of service. I have stayed at this hotel on three separate occasions now, and each time I have been impressed. On my most recent stay, I arrived in Charlotte much earlier than expected; the wonderful front desk agent checked me into my room at 7:00 a.m.! \n\nThe rooms are somewhat dated but still nicely appointed. As a Select Guest member, my Wifi internet connection was free (the hotel otherwise charges $9.95) and the connection was decent. I ordered room service - it arrived promptly and the food was great. \n\nWorking out/hitting the gym while I travel is very important to me. At this hotel, you have two options: you can use the hotel's gym at no charge or you can go to the Charlotte Athletic Club, located in the same building, via a guest pass issued by the front desk. The pass costs $15. The hotel's gym is not what I have been accustomed to in four and five star hotels. It has a couple cardio machines and some free weights - if you want a full workout, you won't get it there. The Charlotte Athletic Club is a wonderful gym and is just as easily accessed as the hotel's own. It bothered me that I had to pay $15, however, to use the gym. The hotel should either provide its guests with a gym comparable to other hotels of its class OR using the Charlotte Athletic Club should be complimentary. \n\nOther than my frustration with the fitness aspect, the hotel is great, the staff are helpful and polite, and the location is superb."
0,"There's nothing about this specific location that is bad.  It's the Einstein Bagels food itself.  I got a Santa Fe Egg wrap, and I don't understand how they can use the term \""egg\"" in the name.  There's no way in hell that slimy yellow gelatin came from a chicken!   Absolutely horrible."
1,"We loved this place, great atmosphere and friendly service. We asked for the freshest fish and Wayne offered to feed us Omakase style. Which was wonderful and reminded us of our old Sushi place in Glendale, CA. Needless to say we were there for hours drinking beer and sake. \n\nWe can't wait to go back again real soon!!!"
0,"Knew it was going to happen!!!!  Arrived at Advantage on 1/20/14 after reserving a car online a month prior.  Lo and behold the car we reserved was not available, and there was a problem with GAS?????   We were told to keep checking back for availability or pay additional dollars for a larger vehicle.  We already had reserved Intermediate vehicle and since there was only 2 of us, we didn't require a bigger vehicle.  Besides, why should we pay more when we already had a car reserved and they did not have the vehicle.  We left the counter and walked over to E-Z Car Rental, where we were able to get a larger car for less money - a larger NEW car (15 miles on it).\n\nWent back to Advantage and told them we did not need the car.  I had asked if we were going to get charged anything and the guy behind the counter said we did not pre-pay so no issue.  Well guess what......since you have to give a credit card to reserve, we were charged for 1 day car rental for a car we didn't get, that they didn't have.  WHAT??????   Letting the cc company know to dispute the cost; ridiculous to get charged for something that was their doing!\n\nNever say never, but will never rent from them again!\n\nGo to E-Z Car Rental folks - great customer service, great vehicles."
0,"Every time I ate at Garcia's, I got sick.  The last time I ate there, my appendix burst. No joke. A few years after my near-fatal experience, a friend of mine ate there and the next day her appendix burst!\n\n Avoid this restaurant like the plague.   Unless you enjoy going septic, that is."
0,"Foodies beware!! This place is bad, bad, bad!! I don't even know where to begin! For starters, when we walked into the restaurant we got hit with such a weird smell. It was like a cross between mothballs and burnt wood. The building looked really old, and the inside was clearly outdated. They obviously didn't change a thing when they opened. Their leather menus have the name \""Kelly's\"" in bright neon.. Well actually Kelly green.. The K is backwards and there's a shamrock on the menu. This can be really misleading from the outside, because it looks and sounds like an Irish pub, not a steakhouse. \n\nThey have live entertainment from 6-10PM daily. Their idea of entertainment is an older man singing terribly to his piano. I joked with my husband and told him that I felt like I was in a nursing home. \n\nFor apps we ordered the steamed Manila clams. I hated them, the sauce was really salty and it tasted like a wine infused BBQ sauce. \n\nIn hopes that it would get better we both had the lobster bisque to follow. Again--- overly salty and the bisque tasted like it came from a can. It does come with a generous scoop of lobster though. \n\nAt this point, I was just looking forward to our steak. It arrived quickly. The waiter said they marinate them in a nice mixture of oils, salt, pepper etc. He proudly boasted that the steaks were high quality.... they weren't good :-( I love filet mignon. Matter of fact, Ive never had a bad steak night in Vegas, until now! \n\nWe also ordered their garlic mashed potatoes, truffled corn and creamed spinach. I'm absolutely sure that they use an instant mashed potato and just add a few fresh potatoes. The consistency was so gritty, you could just tell. The corn did not have truffle oil, or truffle anything. It was creamed corn with a breadcrumb crust on top. As for the spinach, it was watery, not seasoned and undercooked. \n\n\nI've never had a dinner in a restaurant where every aspect of the meal was this bad. This place will not survive with Mortons around the corner and Del Friscos across the street. \n\n\nPros:\n-The server was so nice, very attentive without being overbearing. \n-My martini was cold \n\nI wish I had more nice things to say, but it was just so terrible. No wonder they had such a great deal on groupon. We will never return. Yuck."

1,"Frisbee? Check. Picnic? Check. Scrabble? You damn skippy.\n\nFreedom holds a place in my heart. This is the second most frequented park for me in Charlotte. I love the large space, the range of terrain from running and bike paths, to playgrounds, to island hopping, to outdoor theater, to sports fields, to wooded areas and meeting halls. En short, this place suits all of your park needs, and is a great place to people-watch.\n\nIf so great, then why only 4 stars you may ask? Two reasons.\n\n1.) Clean up and maintenance: Someone needs to seriously address the amount of bird poo in this area. I know I know, there's a lot of bird in the area that contribute to the picturesqueness of the park, and birds poo at an alarming rate. However, when it gets to the point where you need to look down when you're running (so you don't step in anything) instead of taking in the sites, or spend 20 minutes looking for a place to spread your blanket that doesn't have a mound near in, something needs to be done. I know parks don't get a crazy amount of funding, but I'd be willing to volunteer to clean up once in a while, and I hope other people would as well.\n\n2.) This park has the best theater and seating that I've seen in a while... but I never notice any plays going on there? Festivals and other events sure, but I haven't seen any theater events scheduled or advertised anywhere. Saw a guy doing yoga in it once, but it was a far cry from what I'd been hoping to see. \n\nOther than that... it shall remain a sunny day favorite."
1,"Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket is an adventure in itself!  If you are looking for a specific item, you will find it here!  If you aren't looking for anything specific, you'll find it here!  Fresh Quail and Duck eggs, squid, live fish, fruits and vegetables that are exciting and fresh, tofu noodles, mixes, sauces and so much more!!\n\nOur kids love the fish market, yes you can smell it is a fish market as soon as you walk in the door!  The staff is great too, one of the fish mongers even surprised our kids by giving life to a mackerel.  Giving new meaning to the term \""Holy Mackerel!\""  I'm not sure who jumped higher, the kids or the fish monger from the shrieks from our kids!\n\nAfter about and hour of just perusing the aisles, we decided to shop.  We filled our basket with delectable adventurous, for us, items and headed out.\n\nMake sure you have some time to spare before going shopping at Lee Lee's, you sure don't want to miss a great item for being in a rush!"
1,"Okay, it was a couple of weeks ago. Went there with a couple of friends. Yummy food, great curry, great portion of soup, but the sticky rice dessert, yummy, yummy, yummy. Saw the lines to wait when we were leaving, so prepare. I think they have a buffet for lunch, would love to try this sometime."
0,Overpriced French bakery.  I ordered the cinnomon bun which was old and hard.  After being disappointed by the price and the quality of the goods I window shopped at other bakeries on the strip  and i saw the same cinnamon bun at another bakery. I came to the conclusion that Jean Philippe Patisserie bakery does not make their own stuff.   The only thing that they have going for them is the chocolate falls that attract tourist like me to paid for overpriced stuff

0,"I went for happy hour. There is a sign in front of the restaurant that claims appetizers are 1/2 price. They charged full price. When I pointed this out, my waitress said, \""The sign is old.\"" She then took $4 off the bill, meant that one of the three dishes I had as 1/2 priced. This is simply dishonest business.\n\nThis is sad because I liked my meal. The quail and ful medames were very good and the kibbe was also good. The basket of pita was hot and fresh. Up until I got my check, I was satisfied.\n\nTo be fair, the manager did throw a gift card at me on my way out. A nice, if hollow, gesture (even with the gift card, I still paid more than the advertised price). I won't go back to a place that promises one price, charges another, then uses lame excuses to cover up their dishonesty. This wasn't just one bad waiter, the entire staff was dishonest."
0,"After having had lunch at the Grill at Eagle Mountain Fountain Hills, AZ, we looked forward to being able to someday stay at the beautiful resort. A trip to AZ that was related to a recently deceased parent was made better with the fact that my husband booked a suite at the Inn at Eagle Mountain for the 1 night we needed to be in town. 6 weeks prior to our trip he made the reservations and we received confirmation. We looked forward to taking solace in the gorgeous surroundings. We arrived in Phoenix and as we were being shuttled to the car rental facility, my husband turned his phone on. A voice mail had been left from the Inn telling us they did not have a room for us. We immediately called to find out what the problem was and were told they \""we're very sorry, but...\"" they had no rooms available. When we explained we had confirmation from a reservation made through the hotel (not a travel outfit), they again apologized saying \""it appeared we had been 'mistakenly' wait-listed\"". They offered to find us a \""comparable place to stay\"".  We arrived at the Inn about 30 mins later. Our first question was why were we not notified until we had arrived in town. Their reply was that they were waiting to see if there might be a last minute cancellation. As an explanation we were told that new owners had recently taken over and were not well versed in the customer service aspect of hotel management. The receptionists agreed that this was unacceptable.  They did get us booked into another local hotel. Far from the beautiful ambiance of the Eagle Mt properties and the comfort of a king-size suite, we were directed to the nearby Marriott Courtyard, in a room with double beds. Disappointed, doesn't describe how we felt. A \""sorry\"" from the desk and absolutely no suggestion of compensation left us feeling as though we were unimportant as guests. So, no, we will not be returning to Inn at Eagle Mountain! We will not be recommending the Inn at Eagle Mountain."
1,"Great place. Stopped in on a Saturday daytime. Haven't been here in over a year. Same great service from bar and mgmt staff. Plenty of dancers. Very pretty women. All under 24. 2for1 drink specials still happening, just not with Beefeater. Must choose Tangueray or Bombay. Small buffet lunch still served."
0,"I tried to talk my sister out of going here.  I really tried, but she insisted.  She wanted to check out their happy hour, and I was hungry, so in we went.\n\nWhen she asked about happy hour specials, the waitress had a blank stare, and said we have a few beer specials.  We ordered dinner, and it was very forgettable.  Bland and mediocre.   \n\nIf you want great BBQ and comfort food, go to Lucille's at Red Rock or Green Valley on the south side."
0,"An open letter to Primp & Blow: I am a real customer. Writing a real review. Stop accusing your competitors of writing nasty reviews, pay attention to what your customers are saying and fix your business. That's how it works.\n\nMy experience at your shop was just all wrong from the moment I arrived--so much so, that even my 12 year old niece, who was also getting a blow out, realized it. We compared notes and here is our honest, genuine review of Primp & Blow. \n\nThe okay: Open on Sundays, decent location, no wait when we were there, Bumble & Bumble product.\n\nThe bad: The stylists were ditzy, unprofessional and lackluster in general. The girl doing my hair actually stopped what she was doing to read over the iPad over my shoulder so many times that I stopped reading and switched to entertaining myself on my phone. She also, while doing my hair flirted with a maintenance man across the salon and hit me in the head with a blow dryer. She loudly and, in an accusatory tone, commented on any flaws in my cut or hair quality but drew a blank when I asked her for suggestions. \n\nThe ugly: My blowout lasted a few hours. It was pretty--that's about it. I paid extra just to have the stylist touch a curling iron for my blowout and my niece's so I did feel completely stilted. To my knowledge, this is the only blowout bar that charges extra for hot tools. The stylist didn't use any product pre-blowout and it showed. Checkout took forever. It was during that time that the woman working the front desk told me her suspicions about a competitor writing reviews on Yelp. \n\nThe bottom line: I've been to plenty of blow dry salons in the valley--this was by the far the worst. All show, no substance. Nice space, good location, lack of talent.\n\nCatherine Thomas"
0,"Seriously?? MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT and expensive mistake!  This was maybe a step up from Macaroni Grill  but way more expensive and  I dont think the food was as good. The service was crap, the \""fresh made pasta\"" was way under cooked (hows that possible?) and I am familiar with \""al dente\""....but crunchy spaghetti??? C'mon. \nWe ordered the \""exotic\"" cheeseplate to start....LOL, the ding dong waitress had no idea what the cheeses were so we were left guessing.....although it was a fun game, not even 3 star service.  She suggested provolone was an exotic cheese. Precious. \nOrdered sparking water and the waiter kept filling my glass with tap;( and then bringing me a new glass each time.\nThe lobster ravioli wasnt bad, but nothing special. My friend had spaghetti and meatballs and it was BAD. How does an Italian restaurant screw up spaghetti and meatballs???? The noodles were crunchy and the sauce was like canned tomato sauce heated in the micro and the meatballs smelled like canned dogfood. As we left, an older gentleman( owner? Manager?)  asked if everything was \""ok\"" and I said \"" it was ok\"" and he was offended and questioned in his hammed up Italian accent \""where we'd had better food?\""  I told him \"" I make better spaghetti and I'm Irish\"" he didnt think it was funny and asked no more questions;) Do not eat at Ferraros....go to Olive Garden or Mac. Grill and save yourself $100 or pick any other Italian place in Vegas, great odds that its better."
1,"OMG~ We had the most amazing meal at this steakhouse.  Perhaps because I was not expecting much, or perhaps it was the great company I was with, but I HIGHLY recommend Vic & Anthony's.

I'll give it a shot.\n\nBecause I was unwilling to spend too much money for the food, I chose to get 2 small sliders. I don't remember what they were, but they were just generic sliders. Nothing spectacular.\n\nI tried the waffle smothered in chocolate and chocolate bits and ice cream. Syrup Desserts in DTLA is way, way better. All I tasted was chocolate, but no real flavor. The waffle was... bland and lacking."

0,"Don't let House of Cards fool you, there's no decent barbecue joint in Washington DC. So when my Texan friend who has been living in Montreal for a decade told me about a BBQ joint he had been meaning to try - I was in. After all, I was at 4 poutines in 3 days and even as a native Quebecois in town just for a few days, I needed a break. \n\nFrom the very strict \""wait outside\"" policy (I went inside to look at the menu, and I was told to \""take a picture of it and GTFO\"") to the waiter who literally splashed us with coleslaw (everywhere on our shirts - didn't apologize) to the ridiculous prices ($20 or a half rack of ribs, with one side, seriously?), Icehouse screamed attitude. \n\nTheir food better be good then. Right? Not really. Popcorn shrimp had amazing breading, with definite Asian influences with the sweet sauce. The ribs were fall off the bone. Good stuff. The fried chicken had also great batter, but the chicken itself had probably been prepared too long and it was dried DRIED. For my friend, all was saved when they brought the corn bread and potato salad (vinegary, thick, excellent). \n\nFor someone in severe BBQ withdrawal, it was fine. I guess that sums it up. \n\nNote: Posters of shiner bock and all around - and yet you don't serve it? Shame on you."
0,"I've never liked going here, pretty terrible food and service. I actually know some of the people who used to work here, and they aren't exactly in a clear mind when they clock in. Once there were gnats flying around my food, pretty off-putting. I wouldn't go here again unless i had to. If you do like the food and get past all the bad things, try the mother load. Least terrible thing on the menu- they pretty much just throw everything they can into that sandwich."
1,Great value and great beer selection. An IBU (international bittering units) column on the beer menu is very helpful and makes choosing a beer even easier.\n\nCarne Asada and Al Pastor tacos were way above average. Chicken and fish tacos were above average. All tacos are larger than average. This is a relaxing spot with good lighting and friendly servers.\n\nThe exhibition kitchen is unexpected and nice - you can watch the cooks give every taco the attention it deserves.\n\nGood number of big HDTV screens. A smart spot to watch games and/or grab a quick lunch.\n\nAnd the *secret* Habanero salsa is great - ask for it if you need some extra heat - with a spice level somewhere between the secret habanero at Border Grill's (not as hot) and Javier's (hotter).
0,"This was my first time at this location. I did not know Upper Crust Pizza went away.\n\nI wanted the chicken fingers, but they did not come with french fries. Fries separately are an extra $3.00. Not that I am a cheapskate, but not trying to pay $15.00 or more on lunch.\n\nSo, I ordered the student special - 2 cheese pizza slices and a drink for $4.50 as the sign says. I paid $5.95. I didn't argue, but I feel that was a dollar too much?\n\nAnyway, I am a native Long Islander. I can make pizza. I was not very impressed with the cheese pizza. It was okay...nothing that will win award, but it was not inedible. I have had better pizza at the Red Rock Station buffet. \n\nWill I go back? If someone else is buying & this is their choice, I will eat there. It would not be a place I myself would say \""Hey family - let's go to Rocco's\"".\n\nIMO, the best 5 pizza places still in existence in Vegas are: Red Rock Pizza, Napoli's Pizza, Mark Rich's, Broadway Pizza, & Metro Pizza."
0,"Stay away, made reservations, but seating was changed when we arrived. A party of 6 and all had poor meals. Sent a letter to management and never heard back."
0,Location was poor\n\nDecor was decent and upscale\n\nLobster Mac and Cheese was good\n\nBread was ok\n\nService was poor\n\nTomahawk steak was poor
0,"Well we read the reviews and decided as they were so mixed to give it a try.  BIG MISTAKE.\nThe staff out numbered the guests...they stood around in a group yelling and laughing with each other, totally oblivious to the noise they were making....all centered around the bar tender.  Needless to say there was no one at the bar.\nThe air conditioner was on, but someone said the door was to be open, so our food was buzzed by flies, throughout our dining experience.\nWhich brings me to the actual food......mashed potatoes, excellent but cold. Cheese biscuits....probably yesterdays or older, reheated to a dry crisp and then allowed to become cold. Now for the chicken......beautifully served, dry as a bone, tasteless, and certainly NOT just removed from a rotisserie. Sauces, watery and quite disgusting.  Service bad (our server smelled of sweat)\nPlates and silverware very nice!"
0,I like the Gelato here and it's oooooookay in price but everything Is outrageous. I don't care for Tootsie lollipops but twenty something dollars for tiny lollys with bling bling Is just Re-dunkualous! I refuse to pay for over priced candy just because Kimmy Kardashian says so.
0,My wife's food was cold. The baked beans were tasteless.   The service was nice and the waiter was friendly and did make sure my wife's meal was redone and hot.
1,My favorite Indian restaurant! Food is fantastic! Decant price! If you are gonna do dinner the portions are bigger then most Indian restaurants so great for big parties. I prefer the lunch experience with the nice verity of dishes!
0,"I was sadly disappointed with this buffet. The line wait was over 20 minutes, and the cost per person was over $30. Typically this would be worth it EXCEPT, everything I'd gotten on my plate was either cold or lukewarm. And the eggs benedict was like something I'd expected to get at a place comparable to a Ryan's buffet chain. All of the labels were mixed up as well, so I couldn't tell what some of the food even was. The pastries were hard too, like they were brought out from the day before. I went there on an empty stomach and was starving, and even then the food was just disgusting. I expected much more from the Paris, and I won't ever be going back to their buffet."
1,"One of the best nightclubs I have ever been to.  A little over the top though, as the name suggests though."
1,"Have eaten at this place a few times now (dinner and Sunday Brunch).  Really friendly service.  Each time for dinner, our waiters have been very knowledgable about the menu, wines, etc (which is a plus as I'm not an expert on French Cuisine).  Have not had a bad meal yet.  Further the brunch on the weekends is a great way to start the hangover recovery process."
1,great place to play golf and relax. dinner is great and has a full bar. if you get a chance go!!
0,"I have been going to this ranch market for at least eight years. Here is my review.\nThe foods are not the same as they used to be. We bought some tortillas and they usually last about a week, but they started growing mold about three days after.. never used to be this way. \nThe service we had was terrible when we went for breakfast one morning. The guy at the counter was not very professional and made this face when we asked for eggs, it was like he only wanted us to buy something already made.  When we used to go before they were always more than willing to cook us whatever we needed. On my way back to my table, an employee even walked right into me with no apology!  It used to be so different here."
0,"Okay so I went here because it's close to home and boy was that a bad move. I walked in at 6:30pm and the hours on the door clearly stated \""8:00pm close\"". There were 2 stylist sitting down and I thought by the look of things I was sure to get a quick hair cut.So I walk in and I was wrong the women who I later found out was the owner said \""sorry we are closed\"" I replied \""really I'm sorry the door says you close at 8\"" and she says \""well we're closed\"" in a manner that made me think \""wow in this economy you are too busy to take care of a paying customer\"" so I accepted the fact they decided to close early and thankfully they did because I went 2 doors down to Anzhela's Hair Cut and got the BEST cut and color and customer service of my life and I will forever be a loyal customer because they are all about the customer and on top of everything they have wonderful prices. I highly suggest you bypass pin-ups besides they don't need the business apparently, go to Anzhela's."
0,"Margarita pizza  was like out of a box from grocery sauce. The tofu fries tasted weird . The hummus was not authentic . The smoothies were watered down all I can taste was the powder or syrup they used to blended . The chicken breast that my sister got was sooo small it looked like it was for a 6 year old child not an adult. It was very over priced for juice bar food we spend almost $50 for the both if us for lunch&  the funny thing we were still hungry the portion are really small. We really want it to like this new place, but it's not for us."
0,"They lost my clothes and three weeks later they still had not resolved the problem.  The manager was supposed to call me but didn't until I showed up in person and insisted.  Their idea of resolving the problem was waiting to see if they ever turned up on their own. Scary when their response was \""what we usually do in this situation...\""  They lose clothes that often?!?!  \n\nWhat clothes they did return were either wrinkled or stiff as cardboard (I requested light starch).  One pair of pants were torn.\n\nIf you value your clothes, do not use this incredibly unprofessional business. Go to American Cleaners instead.  They are friendly, professional and very well priced."
1,"Lovely. That is the best word to describe this place. Everything about it is lovely: the food, the service, and especially the setting. \n\nI went here for brunch at 11:00 a.m. on Sunday and expected to have a long wait for table (especially since it was a warm and sunny day in January) but we arrived and the place was practically empty. We got to choose our table and enjoy a relaxing meal. \n\nThe service was fantastic. From the complimentary valet, the hostess, our waiter, and busser. They were all professional, courteous, and attentive without being pushy. \n\nWe both really liked our food, starting with the banana bread they bring to your table. He went with the steak and eggs (that come with poached eggs on a corn muffin with hollandaise sauce...good lord) and I opted for the three egg omelet minus the shrimp (corn, peppers, spinach, cheese) and they both came with their potatoes (sweet and regular, cubed and seasoned). It was presented well, tasted great, and left us feeling full but not heavy. \n\nNow, all of that is fine and good...but what you should really come here for is the setting. We sat in the outside courtyard and it was just so picturesque (it reminded me a lot of the Arizona Inn in Tucson). Southwesterny without being over the top, brick patio, lots of trees, colorful flowers, fountains, and green grass. \n\nI think this would be a great place for brunch, date night, dinner with your family, rehearsal dinner, and even small wedding. I would also love giving the Hermosa Inn a whirl because it looks very charming."
1,"LOVE. THIS. PLACE.\n\nFirst tried this place on my drive cross-country and it was very good. I raved about the burger to everyone for a very long time.\n\nBy chance, when I was visiting home in the south, I spotted that culver's sign out of the corner of my eye and proceeded to flip out. My passenger in the car was baffled at my sudden excitement. \n\nOn the way back from my primary destination, I stopped here and my friend and I were in burger & shake heaven."
0,"Very confusing airport.  For an International Airport, I would have expected a more luxury feel.  Definitely not the airport you would want to get stuck for hours in.  I flew southwest and Gate C and D did not have great restaurant choices or stores to look in.  You have to walk what feel likes miles to buy a water or grab a magazine, and food."
0,"Worst Korean BBQ I've ever had. The brisket was fatty and tough, the Kalbi they did have on the Menu they didn't bring out until way later when they've tried to fill you up with the low quality stuff to get you full,   limited sides..... Will not be going back..."
0,"I would love to give 5 stars because their Chinese menu is fantastic. Love the wonton soup. My only complaint is the last 2 times I have gone there for lunch only to be told there would be a 15 minute wait. Mind you, there was only a handful of people in there eating.  While waiting one particular time I watched the hostess do the same to families in which they left and wouldn't wait. We decide to leave as well. The other time we were told the wait was long because the waitress was not very good, she would be very slow. I would appreciate it if I could have made my mind up on the staff. Very unprofessional. I will get her name if I try again for lunch in the future because she should not have a job there dealing with the public."
0,"Went on a Thursday for happy hour, light crowd, bar seating not nearly a quarter full.  The bar service was horrendous, getting a bartenders attention became a joke with the six people in our group.  The food, delivered by the kitchen, was great, the smoky whiskey drinks we begged for were wonderful, but the bar tenders were abhorrent.  The ceiling must be impeccable because that's all the bartenders looked at when they occasionally graced us with their  presence.  I'm being completely serious, it was that bad.  Industry must do one heck of a business to get away with treating patrons this badly.  So if you like pleading for service and being treated like sh.t, by all means make the trip out to industry and quickly learn your place."
1,"We had an awesome time at the Bank, thank's to Christian Guterres.\nWe were able to get a great table on the dance floor and a great price on a Saturday night last minute.\n\nChristian helped me plan a great surprise 30th birthday for my fiance -- starting with a Limo ride, skipping the line, and having full bottle service -- all pre-paid so we didn't have to worry about anything.\n\nMusic was great - top 40s, R/B -- great for dancing the night away\n\nIf you are looking for a great night out, contact Christian!"
1,"Located in the middle (or does anyone really every know where anything is at in these huge hotel casinos?) of The Cosmopolitan. It's a little open to the ching-ching and hubbub of the casino, but I guess it is what it is in Vegas.\n\nI read the menu and while some things sounded pretty good, I actually wanted something different. Talked to the bartender about what I was thinking and he made a drink with tequila, ginger soda, cayenne and a dash of ghost chili oil. I'm also sure there were bitters in it, because precisely 0% of mixology drinks have no bitters.\n\nAnyhow, it was exactly what I wanted. After that I ordered a few more drinks just by explaining the taste profile I wanted and the bartender nailed them. It was great, synergy with a mixology guy.. now we're talking.\n\nThen his shift ended. The next bartender wasn't bad, but he wasn't on the same wavelength and I would have to ask him to change things in my drinks. Not really an over-all slam here, just a mild let-down from the previous guy. I'm sure he made on-menu drinks very nicely.\n\nService was a little on the slow side, but yeah.. Vegas. Prices were high, but yeah, Vegas.\n\nAll in all, if I was ever forced to go back to Las Vegas again (Im praying not to have to), I would definitely return."
0,"Carnegie Deli was recommended by a few people to try while I was in New York.  Unfortunately, my schedule was packed and I couldn't make it.  Since we found out there was a Carnegie located in the Mirage Hotel, it was a perfect time to give their famous hot pastrami sandwich a try.\n\nThe chicken noodle soup ($6.99) and the chicken soup with matzo balls ($7.99) are a must order!  The noodles were small and tender.  Both soups come with a chicken soup which is flavorful and extremely comforting.  Definitely perfect for the morning after a long Vegas night.\n\nThe hot pastrami sandwich ($16.99) was a disappointment.  A large amount of pastrami is stacked between two pieces of bread (choice of rye, white, or pumpernickel) and served with a side of pickles and dijon mustard.  Though I ordered a HOT pastrami sandwich, it came out room temperature and the meat was dry.  I thought maybe I just got a dud, but my friends said the same thing after eating there a day later. \n\nWHAT TO KNOW:\n*Dine in or take out (note: they're separate entrances)\n*Consider sharing, portions are HUGE\n*Breakfast served all day\n*Not sure on their exact hours. Their napkins say 7am-2am, but they were open around 4:30am"
0,Good concept....poor performance. I love me some BBQ....especially while waiting for my car.  However theirs was dry.  I was excited to try the pulled pork omelet with mozzarella.   People must be deprived of good bbq in NorSco because this was weak.  Now I will try again because I have to have some brisket.  But never again with the pork or eggs.  BOO.
0,"Roll the dice, and go to this location.  I went here for nearly 6 months and got a different haircut from 6 different people.  I'm a guy...short on the sides with clippers, scissors on top.  Nothing fancy.\n\nUnfortunately that's a bit too much for most of the folks who work here, bless their hearts.  The final straw was last time when I'm pretty sure they had the assistant who runs the cash register give me a haircut so someone could take a break.  I had the distinct feeling he'd never given a haircut before....and I had to go home and \""fix it.\""\n\nI'm done going here.  If you're a guy, try out Dan Cercone Hairstyling in Bloomfield.  It's cheaper, faster, and better.  And no, I don't work there."
0,"Stopped in here because I saw it whilst driving past, and saw an item on display out front that I was interested in. When I asked about it, they did not have a price for it and wanted me to wait while they \""researched it\"" online--because the person who brought it in didn't know what to charge and wanted the owner of the store to set the price for it. I finally got tired of waiting and left. The store had a back room that was cordoned off from shoppers...maybe they should put merchandise that is not ready for sale in that area to save shoppers some frustration. They did have some nice items, but I felt too frustrated by my experience to bother with them."
1,"If you ever come here you must sit outside and enjoy the poolside view, even if its a little hot, you wont reget it.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came for lunch after checking into encore. We ordered the organix mix salad, and beef sliders, truffle fries.\n The food was delicious. If you get the salad, there is no need to add meat, because honestly they dont give you that much for the extra price and the salad itself is savory. \n\nThe sliders were good, typical sliders nothing really special about them, I guess you're better off ordering a burger for the same price as the sliders.\n\nOMGOSH the truffle fries were SO GOOd!!! Definitely would order these again! There were freshly made a d had truffle sauce and cheese over it. So bad for you but ooooo so good.\n\nOver all the prices seemed a little steep, but it is vegas so what do you expect. The serve was good, they seemed really busy but they were attentive."
1,"I've been to Waffle Houses all over the country and they are always consistent! Great food at Great prices, you can't go wrong! I know for some people The Waffle House is not your cup of tea but I promise you; the older the location (and grill) the better the food! Mmmm, I can almost taste their Philly on Texas Toast and cheesy eggs and grits!"
1,"Simply put... My home away from home.\nLux is so much more than a coffee bar...  it's a community.  The staff is great, the owner has an amazing memory for names and faces...  I'm constantly impressed, and the people who frequent this great spot are eclectic, intelligent and friendly.  It's like Cheers... but better.... and without the booze.....\n*anyway* you get my point... from my first visit here, it has felt like home and over the years I've made more great friends here than I can count.\n'nuf said."
1,"Great atmosphere. Perfect sushi restaurant for after work drinks and a quick bite. The location on South Boulevard is nice and yet parking is still OK. The sushi is not cheap, but the quality and art of sushi is what you expect from a high end sushi restaurant. I am not an elitist so I prefer the cool atmosphere with the quality in the food. If it were more stuffy or \""quite\"" I would not like Nikko as much.\n\nAlmost my fav spot in Charlotte, but definitely up there..."
0,2 words.  food poisoning\nHusband and I visited Vegas at ate at Hecho on 5/27. We shared a carne asada .About 3 hrs after we ate we experienced severe gastrointestinal problems. My husband had non stop vomiting... so much that we spent that night and into the morning at a disgusting and dirty ER. We were bed ridden the next 2 days. Anyone else experience this?!!
0,I'll keep my review short & simple. Ok food & excessively long waiting time for your order to arrive. Judging by all the Bob Marley posters on the wall & his music playing in the restaurant... I'll say the workers are slow to cook & serve because they may be more concerned with being high than serving their customers.
1,He and my girlfriend came over tonight to have some fettucini alfredo and we just ordered the two small one would have been plenty our server Luis was very nice and courteous we will return.
0,Boulder strip discounted crap would eat if I was broke but that's about it
0,"When I asked why every drink cost at least $2 more than at any other CBTL, I was told that because the address is Las Vegas Blvd, they feel they are entitled to charge \""Casino Prices\"". I understand they can pretty much take car-less tourists hostage in a casino setting on the strip, but most people do drive to this mall which is like a regular mall anywhere else in the country. Outrageous!"
0,"I stopped by this location for lunch with a couple of co-workers on Thursday. We each ordered the two slice lunch special and drink for $4.00. I would have liked to see a pizza and wing lunch combo like another pizza establishment down the road. \n\nBoth of the people in my group went back to the counter because the pizza was cold. The staff was very friendly and provided a new slice recently from the oven.  The pizza itself was just okay for me. I like the thicker crust and the taste was fine, but really it didn't stand out to me anymore than a Digiorno."
0,"I had an appointment at 11 am and it is now 12:30pm and I still have not been seen. Why make an appointment if you still have to wait this long? I'm a healthy adult in my 20s and just need a shot, didn't think it would take this long. I wanted to come here because I am Vietnamese and wanted to have a Vietnamese doctor to feel more comfortable. This has not been enjoyable. Waiting and waiting. I respect your time by coming early to my appointment, I expect my time to be respected too... Whether it's a Saturday and I'm not working or not. Will probably be changing my PCP. :-("
0,Been to this place over 20x and this place has really gone down hill in most areas. It was once a 4-5 star restaurant and the food was great but I have noticed the pattern...
0,"Many airports these days are attempting to become more upscale; there are sculptures and musicians and art and fancy food. In theory this is great! If I'm going to pay more for buying food in an airport, I might as well be paying for something good, right? Problem is, when it goes wrong, I just feel cheated. They should know better!\n\nTake Humble Pie. Theoretically a gourmet pizza joint in the Phoenix airport, the pizza they gave me was one of the worst I've had in YEARS. The crust was soggy, the toppings spartan, the sauce sickly-sweet and the greasiness unbearable. When I first picked up a slice, all the toppings promptly fell off. I tried to put the toppings back on, but the greasiness of the pizza left me to eat it two-handed: first a bite of the crust, then a bite of the toppings.\n\nReally, even if this place billed itself as a super-cheap pizza joint I'd feel cheated."
0,"This was my first and last time at this nail shop..... Let me start at the beginning:\n\nMy best friend and I make appointments to get our nails done hours before arriving, even though we arrive early to our scheduled appointment time we still wait 15-20 min to be helped... No big deal in itself... Although annoying.\n\nMy friend sits down with one of the nail techs.... She begins her fill in, about 15 in she sees that one of her regular customers enter the shop and IMMEDIATELY stops doing my friends nails and tells her that her appointment is here... What about OUR appointment?! That was so rude!!!!\n\nFinally my nails are finished and my friend is still getting the gel polish and glitter on her nails (btw it was nothing like what she asked them to do) I'm still waiting..... I wait a whole hour because apparently there is only one lady in the shop that can do designs...... So I continue to wait because the nails they did looked TERRIBLE! I couldn't leave the shop without a design it would look like my 4 year old niece did my nails... Yikes! \n\nFinally I sit down with the lady who does the designs, she proceeds to text her date for the night to complain about still being at work.... In front of me! I can clearly see her entire conversation. RUDE! \n\nIn the end I got $5 off the price of my nails which was probably inflated anyways because it usually cost less then the discounted price they gave me.\n\nMy friend paid $50 for a fill in with gel polish which was with a $5 discount for waiting... More than she has ever paid for her nails to be done and neither of us liked them! \n\nI will never return to this nail shop!!!! Even if it was free! Worst nail salon in Henderson stay away!"
1,"This was some damn good pizza. We were in town from Chicago and looking for some pizza to bring back to the room to watch the Irish. Lucky for us Grimaldi's was right down the road. We perused their menu for a bit and put together our combination. Which you pretty much have to do as they have only three to choose from: plain, pesto or white. I'd like to see them have some creative combos, instead of nickel and diming you for the toppings you are bound to add. That said we opted for garlic, sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms. The pizza came out pretty quick and we hurried off to chow and watch the game. It certainly could have been hotter, but I put that on us. The pizza was great and the crust was fantastic. They had gone into this elaborate story of how they mimic NYC water to get the perfect crust. It must be the truth, because it was damn good. Slightly charred, chewy and crusty. It held up well to the generous heaping of toppings they laid on us. It could have used a bit more sauce, but really I'm not going to add that as a topping. Pretty tasty pie and we put a beat down on it like the Irish put on Nevada."
0,Service was slow..staff was inattentive and nothing was done when we complained.won't be back.
0,Dean K. is right. The owner here clearly had zero interest in serving us. She was bitter and bent out of shape because we had a few kids in shop for all of 4 minutes. Will never come back.\n\nNews flash for people out there selling various forms of ice cream or gelatto or whatever----KIDS LIKE YOUR PRODUCT.\n\nSo relax when they come inside your store. They're excited about getting ice cream.\n\nI'll come back when the owner changes her tune.
0,"We have been coming to Fibbers for over 8 years.  Have always enjoyed the atmospher, staff, and fair prices.  They have good food for a bar.  \nLately the staff they have brought in is less than spectacular.  They are slow, unfriendly, and need to learn a little bit about customer service.  We sat at the bar last night and waited over 10 minutes just to have them take our drink order.  We had to flag down the bartender PJ several times to get food orders and our second round of drinks.  I found him to be rude and condescending when we dealt with us.  Also noticed several other customers had to flag him down to order more drinks. Not what I consider good customer service.  There were a few people in the place but it was not what I would consider busy.  \nFood took well over 30 minutes to arrive.  We just ordered flat bread and a salad.  In the past this would have been there in under 15.  The flat bread was cold and a portion of it was missing.  It must have stuck to the pan when they were making it.  In the past the place always felt like the comfortable bar to stop by after work, now it felt cold.  \nLike I said, we have been coming here for years but if the service is like this the next time we stop by, we might need to look at other options."
1,"I don't often go to dinner here, but mostly for happy hour, again this mama like to go out but lives on a budget. They have a little good happy hour that I think we should all take advantage of it once it a while. Do no the big fancy building intimidate you, they have cocktails and delicious appetizers for $5.00 each. I am South American so I always go for my MOJITOS!! epa! The bartender, Ryan, a.k.a. Carlos (My friend couldn't remember his name so we decided to call him Carlos and he is ok with it, but it's Ryan) We also order the Avocado eggrolls and the Chinese salad. My friends loves the margaritas, but I am not a tequila drinker (for obvious reasons since I am a light wright). Oh, and my favorite: The Peach Bellinis!!! They are not part of the happy hour menu but they are amazing!!! Please do not leave the restaurant without sharing a piece of cheesecake. The upside down pineapple is amazing!! One day after a movie date with this guy, we went there for late coffee and a cheesecake, it was nice, romantic, and sweet!! Just throwing some romantic ideas for you boys!! (wink, wink...)   \n\nIf you ever go the Scottsdale location and sit a the bar, ask for Carlos, he will probably have a laugh and will know exactly who and how you know his name LOL"
1,"There are many decent indian restaurants in town, but here is one more yelp vote calling this place the BEST indian lunch buffet in Vegas.  \n\nBig selection, so even if one item is not to your liking (ingredient or spice-wise), there will be plenty else to nosh on.  Service is quick to get beverages and naan on the table, and tables cleared for new customers. You feel very welcome here :)\n\n(Side note: Always a bummer though to see how much food is wasted at buffets here in town.  C'mon folks ~ take a lil to see if ya like it, and if you do, go back for more! Discarding plates still piled with food is appalling.  And please at least have had a meal in the last 24 hours ~ the single diner next to us sat down and demanded three baskets of naan right off the bat...did he finish them? NO.)"
1,"I went here with my gf a year ago and loved it so much I decided to come again and take my parents with us.  We got the tix for tonight which saved us about 13 bucks a plate.  This is the only Brazilian place that I have been to that has fried bananas so for a whole year, I have been craving that and they were as good as I remembered them to be.  \nAs far as the meat portion of the dinner, it was great.  I tried everything once, and some twice, and some about 8 times.  If they would of let me, I would of just had them give me the whole pineapple in the beginning to save them all the trips back to me.  I really loved the sirloin steak, it was cooked perfectly to where it melted in your mouth.  \nI thought the service was great.  Our server Dave, who we had the first time was fantastic and very personable.  I can't wait to go back and have more of their fried bananas."
1,"Its such a gem off the strip.  Its actually a bar (so hide your children or your wife).  The portions are gigantic but watch out for the $5 sharing fee.  Since there's only about 20 seats and typically a huge line, come during the off hours like breakfast.  The chef is also hilarious.  Here's an interaction we saw with a customer:\n\""Where is the oysters from\""\n\""The water\""\n\""Which water?\""\n\""Walmart\""\n\n\""How do you cook it?\""\n\""With Magic\""\n\nWould definitely come back here just for entertainment."
1,"What a great experience located in the South end of uptown. With any new experience, I will ask what is either most popular or recommended. I ended up with a waiter that probably knew about as much as me just by looking at the menu. I didn't ask how long he had worked there. I ended up with the treasure pot. Excellent choice. Portion size is on the money for lunch. The sushi is pretty good if you absolutely must have sushi for lunch. I had the 13 year old with me. If it passed her approval then I know we were in a good spot. Pros are good selection from a wide range of Asian fair. Cons are ensuring you time the place right as it gets crowded for lunch, ensuring you land a good waiter/waitress and asking for a little bit of a higher health score. I prefer sushi served in restaurants that are 99-100+. \n\nFYI, like E2, this restaurant is on the more expensive side for lunch. The atmosphere is hip contemporary. Know what you're expecting here for lunch. Unless you happen to be within walking distance to some of our best Charlotte sushi/Asian joints (not in Uptown I promise), then go knowing it's the best place close by."
1,$2 big microbrew beers!  Decent bbq spare ribs.  Excellent sides of baked beans and cole slaw.  I ordered the combo ribs and chicken and the chicken was not very good.  But the ribs are great.  Corn on the cob was just ok.  Service was excellent.  Everything here is cheap with your players card.  Great food and drink value.
1,"I personally love John Cutter!!! I think it is a great friendly neighborhood restaurant. Portions are HUGE so the prices are great for the amount of food you get. They also recently started doing half portions of items at a smaller price. I have not tried one bad thing on the the menu. All the employees are so nice as well... I am so glad a place like this came into the area. Another great thing, they are now doing breakfast on the weekends!!! Big portions as well. It's nice to have some where to get a real breakfast close by, not a doughnut...  I highly reccommend going in. They know what they are doing ;-)"

1,Food is very good all the time. I remember when it was 1 tiny store. Pho with meatballs (P7 no longer on menu but they will still make it for you.) and the salad rolls (K2) are my favorites.
1,"Love this Restaurant. The food is authentic.  Remember, make sure you order Hunan dish like Hunan dried pork."
1,I lived in Arizona for 6 years but it took leaving and coming back for a visit to discover this hidden gem.  The pizza and service were great.  It was a little spendy for a pizza but the quality of ingredients made it worth it.
1,"Love love love this place . When it comes to places to eat I'm a very picky and hard person to please and this place was on point with everything .. The staff is great, food hot, orders were taken correctly and arrived to the table correctly .. And anytime I decided to write a review then you know that Duckworths is the place to visit ... I'm looking forward to the football season, cause I've just found a new place to watch the game !!"
0,Well being a loyal customer sometimes has its disappointments. Today I went to Dutch Bros on Camelback and Central as this is one of my favorite places to get my usually iced beverage but I've noticed that lately they have been filling the cup all the way with ice. Last time I was there I asked for light ice and they still filled it past the half way mark. Today I requested less than half ice in my beverage because I was tired of getting half the product and paying close to five dollars for it They tried to hit me with a speech about charging me an additional fifty cents to top it off. What happened to these guys?  They use to be so good to their customers. Now it seems it's all about the profits. I remember when they first opened and I still gm there. I have spent hundreds of dollars at this establishment. Hope they make a change or I'm gonna Starbuck it again!
0,"The chicken is good here I will give them that. But this place is quite pricy for the selections. Service is slow & in-attentive. Certainly will not be returning, don't see this one lasting here."
0,Terrible service or should I say no service.  I was told the plumber would be at my place between 0800-1000 and guess what?  No one showed up nor was there a phone call.  I called 30min after to find out what happened. The lady (I believe they are out of state because she ask me what city I live in) told me he was on the way and he would call me.  No phone call or a plumber.  I called back again to cancel.  I called for another plumber who arrived in 15 min and more affordable.  I highly don't recommend this place unless you want to wait all day long not knowing whats going on then this is your place.  Terrible.
0,"I texted the number *on their website* to be added to their promotions, got the text code, went in and they said that the promotion was over. I said its still on their very own website. How can it be over? Nonetheless, I gave them the promo coupon from right here on Yelp. They said that was over too. This was like 2 months ago. It's still here on Yelp! I walked out and went to Fogo de Chao. While I was in there getting denied, I did get a good look at their selections and service. Horrible! Don't waste your time. These guys' dishonesty doesn't bode well for the quality of their food."
1,"If you go.... and fly in for this venue, fly to Phoenix and either go to Holiday Inn Express or rent a camper. It was great, but they need a dance floor for the fans. Its out in the boonies and have VERY Clean johns that FLUSH.They are serviced every day. The food is mostly fair ground type food so enjoy Indian Fry Bread, Gyros, BBQ, fresh ice cream floats  and stuff like that. Mostly carnival type of food. The music makes up for all of the rustic stuff. Great music and sound. The crowd gets pretty rowdy at night, so if you buy seats you may want to spring for VIP seating. They even have VIP that include a wonderful dinner and discounted drink tickets."
1,"First time having a massage that wasn't in a fancy hotel. I made the appointment for couples massage a day in advance. The lady on the phone was very nice and accommodating. \n\nThe location was not far from Vdara. The place didn't look fancy or flashy. No ambient lighting or anything either. Don't expect posh furniture or decorations either. Just think, this is the reason why you're getting your bang for you buck. \n\nMy masseuse was Rosie. She was very friendly and sweet. She had me describe my ideal pressure and problem areas. I told her between a Swedish and deep tissue and she nailed it. \n\nFull time and good price for the couples massage. \n\nIf you don't want to pay more just for fancy decor and posh furniture, come here. They get straight to the point :) will be back again!"
1,"I recently stayed here for 3 nights. The room was quite large with a king bed and a sitting area with a fold out couch and a table with chairs. Large TV. Very large bathroom with 2 sinks and a separate toilet/shower area.  There was even a phone in there!  Small refrigerator, nice sized closet. View overlooking the golf course. Bed was a little firm for my taste. The room was very nice and clean. Very quiet in the rooms, even at night.  Workout facility is clean. Casino has nice updated machines. Parking in the garage is easy. Even went to the movies, was surprised that the movie ticket price was comparable to other theaters."
0,"Forgettable experience. Asked our waiter what is popular, he said to toss a coin. We choose 2 cioppinos. Even after a 50% off comp! it came to $68 with tip. They added 18% automatically without informing me. I caught it right before tipping out myself. For value and great seafood, I'll stick to Tides at Green Valley Ranch. Shame on you guys! But hey, your bread was good. I'll give you that!"
0,"I feel bad only giving this place two stars, but I don't know.. The portions were huge, but the food was kind of.. Bad. The service was average.\n\nI had a Salmon Scramble and the girlfriend had Roast Chicken Hash. There was a lot of it, including giant sprigs of sage. Like, novelty giant sprigs of sage. I found a couple small bones in the salmon which didn't totally put me off, just a little bit. I think it was the lack of flavor that did it, really. Everything tasted bland. The GF wasn't a big fan of her hash. I've seen it mentioned on here a few times, and she agrees, the chicken was very dry. \n\nAll in all, we're not fans and I doubt we'll be going back. I know it's supposed to be an institution of Las Vegas, but I can't see how."
0,"I was a fan of the club when I joined a few years ago, the cost was $10/month, so figured why not. However, this past year, I got divorced and moved to the north valley and the nearest club is about 15-20 minutes away, so I decided to cxl my mo-to-mo membership. I was aware of the cxl fee ($25).  Long story short, been a long difficult road trying to cxl my membership. Took 2 letters and a trip to the nearest location (this one is closest to me, at about 10 miles away). I was originally told due to the difficulties I encountered they'd waive my cxl fee, but last night when I got down to the club, I was informed by Tessa, the mgr, that they cannot do that. I feel they strung me along for a couple extra months and got an addl $30 out of me in the first place, they should have waived the cxl fee. I was so irritated but saw no way out except to pay the $25 and walk away. LA Fitness treated me the same way when I cxl'd my membership with them several years ago. I should have learned! Bait and switch, yes, will I Yelp about my experience? YOU BETCHA!"
0,Looks dirty and run down
0,"FRAUD ALERT\n\nAfter visiting in early June with a large group of friends, several of us who paid with credit card at this establishment were hit with fraudulent charges, both from the restaurant and from a location in the country of Turkey. \n\nAfter calling the place, the girl who answered the phone confirmed that she's received several reports of this during the past week. \n\nApparently there is/was an employee lifting CC #s.\n\nFood-wise, it was so-so. Value-wise, the food was pretty great, compared to other locations in the mall."
0,"I gave one star bc I HAD to. I have never in my life been to such an unprofessional place in my life.  I'll spare the name of my \""stylist\"" but why, idk. bottom line is, if you can't cut hair right, don't cut someones hair!!  I'll stick to letting the professionals at Honeycomb Organic Hair Salon  do my cutting from now on. How hard could it possibly be to trim BANGS?! THEY'RE ALREADY PARTED SHAPED! My bangs look disgusting and I'm not going to let that hack job TRY to fix them. Bs!"
0,"The food was good, however, 11 (and counting) of our 23 are now sick from food poisoning."
0,"What a sad excuse for a chain that touts its football games and specials on Sunday. I walk into this place about 1:30pm on Sunday and the hostess has no idea who is playing or what is TV. The bar has one person and one table filled. Meanwhile, there are football banners and pennants everywhere promoting the NFL, but they apparently don't carry the NFL package because only the nationally televised game was on their five TV's. Even the staff is wearing football jersey's - well there was a reason it was empty right smack in the middle of an NFL Sunday. What a pretender."
0,"First I will start off with the service for ski equipment, they do a fantastic job tuning and sharpening skis as well as fitting boots. They are very knowledgable and helpful. \n\nNow for the prices. They seem to be higher than anyone else. We recently went in looking for ski boots for my 13 yr old daughter, they were charging $170, when the exact same boot can be purchased down the street at MC Sports for $99. They also mention that they have a program to give you 50% of the cost in a trade in toward new boots the following year. Sounds great right? Especially if you have kids that seem to outgrow everything each year. But beware, we were 2 days past the 1 year and they would not honor the deal. Really? 2 days? They would not budge on this and were generally rude about it. Anyway, you would save money buying 2 pairs of boots elsewhere over 2 years than trying this deal."
1,First time to the restaurant and my husband and I enjoyed both the atmosphere and the food.  Service was great!  We'll be going back!!!
1,"I have been a fan of Surf City Squeeze since before I moved here from California, and seriously cannot remember if I've ever had anything other than the blueberry banana smoothie. I don't come that often, but when I do I can't stray from the most delicious blueberry concoction on the planet. A small size is perfect, and a medium is generous and filling enough for me to never order the large. I tend to buy it whenever I happen to be at Meadows Mall or going to Cardenas, but if you like blueberries try it. It is a foodgasm in your mouth. Based on how delicious it is I'd imagine the other things on the menu to be decent at the very least. But I'll let you find that out while I go have some more blueberry banana goodness..."
0,"Bad service, not true about free drinks on cards, women pay $15 for open bar but men go in free.  However, simple drinks for men are $11 and up."
0,"This was quite possibly my worst dining experience since moving to Phoenix about six months ago.\n\nMy wife and I eat out quite frequently and had heard decent reviews about Spasso. We decided to visit the restaurant last night with another couple.\n\nThe food was overpriced and only average. We ordered their mozzarella plate that was served with soggy vegetables and 3 tiny pieces of cheese. For almost $15 I would have expected more. While the mozzarella was the highlight of our meal, imagine sharing 3 pieces of cheese amongst 4 people. This was the BIGGEST mozzarella plate that was offered on the menu.\n\nOur calamari appetizer was chewy and lukewarm at best. The pizzas were alright, nothing spectacular. Very much your run of the mill pizzeria.\n\nService is where this restaurant falls flat on its face. Their website, along with our waitress, speaks that the restaurant closes at 10pm.\n\nAt 9:15 we tried to order a bottle of wine and were told that we couldn't have the bottle because they were closing. The \""manager\"" turned the lights off in the bar and brought us our check.\n\nFor a restaurant as empty as this place was, I couldn't believe they would have turned down the chance to make an additional $40. Their manager knows his business way more than I do and maybe he's doing so well he simply didn't need our $40.\n\nThat being said, I've never been denied service in a restaurant and I've never been told so blatantly and rudely to leave.\n\nWe won't be back and I suggest you take your money elsewhere."
0,"OMG- avoid for the time being... No Hostess, confusion out the Wazoo! Was this a soft opening with no workers what so ever that know what they are doing?? Wow! Wow... Who ever reviewed this place ... What were you reviewing? The fact that you were the only one there? Maybe u get service but talk about unprepared.. It was crazy! They had tables but no one who knew what they were doing on the floor- it was a mad house! \nWe checked Out! Didnt even get menus our water within the first 10-mins of siting there and watching the madness unfold-"
0,"Not too much going on here. It's not my style to compare a pizza place to Slices but that's kinda what it felt like here....only not as good. Feels weird saying that. I had a couple slices of pepperoni, which, here it comes, tasted like cardboard. and my girl had a slice of sausage and pepperoni and some kind of square margarita pizza without marinara, which was their only saving grace. It was actually pretty good.\n\nThere are too many other dining options in this area. But if I'm in the mood for sub par pizza by the slice, I might stop back in."
0,Tasteless food that arrived over an hour after it was ordered and was cold.  Will never order from here again.
1,The stars are for the food.\n\nZero stars for the owners. Why do you have to be so unpleasant? You are in the service industry remember? If you are trying to be funny stick to baking.
1,"It is expensive but on par with Old Montreal rates. But lets be honest, you go here for the atmosphere first and the food second. And it would be tourists that go here so they don't really care about the price. \n\nAtmosphere: You have to sit outside. It was raining what we went, but the upside down umbrellas catch the rain to keep you dry. There are a couple places where the rain enters the patio area but it isn't a big deal and it is kinda fun to watch the servers walking with umbrellas so not to get your food wet. \n\nService: The service was some of the best I have ever received. They were friendly and accommodating. I asked to have the forest crepe with something other than the chicken sauce that came with it and they didn't have a problem with this. \n\nFood: Delicious and eye-appealing. \n\nPrice: I said that it is costly... and it is... but it is not too over the top. It was actually cheaper than the hotel I was staying at. So for the great presentation, and wonderful atmosphere it was worth trying."
1,"Nightclub rating only...\n\nWe got lucky because we happened to arrive during Kris Humphries' (new husband of Kim Kardashian) bachelor party.\n\nI also saw Jordan Farmar, Lamar Odom and Scott.\n\nPlace was packed on a Saturday night and we didn't want to wait in line so we did bottle service. Cost us $575 total for 5 guys and we got grey goose and our choose of drinks.\n\nYou don't get your own VIP booth - you actually get to sit on a long couch and you get a small section along with the other bottle service people.\n\nOverall pretty cool club, but I think it's pretty small compared to others like XS, Marquee, JET, and Pure."
0,So ive been there for dinner many times and honeslty I didny like it as much as the lunch special! But then they changed their price snd they are very expensive for sushi only because its kosher. So i mean if my family decides to go ill tag along but if its by choice.. id go to maiko!!
1,"Absolutely AMAZING! I didn't stay here but I gambled here a few times and words can't describe how awesome this place is. The architecture is absolutely insane. This is the type of building that you look at and say to yourself \""Wow, I can't believe what humans are capable of constructing\"". \n\nThis casino reminded me of the casino from Ocean's 13. It has the most advanced gaming equipment I have ever seen. The roulette table light up all the winning spot once the ball drops into a number. I joked with one of the dealers and told her she probably loves this new feature because it makes her job 100 times easier, she laughed and said \""you betcha!\"".\n\nThis place is a must visit next time you are in Vegas even if you aren't staying there."
1,"Brunch is seriously one of my absolute favorite meals (though I really love lunch and dinner a lot too... umm... it's an ongoing internal debate, which one I love the most). Cafe Continental is an argument FOR brunch. All of their benedicts are spectacular and if you love french toast, you are in luck. Absolutely fantastic! And their omelets? Arg. SOOO good. The cheesy grits are good, if that's your thang but the side of potato salad is equally delicious. Their dinners are okay, from what I remember but not stand-out excellent like their brunches.\n\nAlso. They have the most awesome coffee mugs which were handed down from generations of restaurants or something amazing like that. AND you can't find them anywhere anymore!!! SOOO COOL. I want a mug!!! Anyone know a good smith metal?? lol."
1,"Awesome place, cute girl bartender, cold beer, what else do you need! Yelp special is $1 dollar for a pint and FourSqaure special has a 25 cent pint special, nice!!!"
1,Whenever we throw a party we like to get a few buckets of wings from here. There are a ton of flavors to choose from and everyone I have tried is very good. The service is always prompt an I get taken care of. For those that like to hang out it has a great vibe and fun atmosphere.
1,"This was my first dining experience at Green Valley, but I was not disappointed. Some of us had delicious fresh fish grilled with saut\u00e9ed veggies, others had delicious oysters, while I had the all you can eat crab legs. After four buckets of legs & claws, I was overwhelmingly satisfied, and when we received the bill it averaged to less that $30 a person with food and wine.\nI would return here anytime!"
1,"Great cupcakes, pastries, baked goods, and breads.\n\nThe workers here are super nice and the shop is clean and cute.\n\nI wish I could have tried more stuff, but I only had the chance to try their cupcakes. They were moist and full of flavor. If you're looking for a sweet treat, make sure to come here. They are also on the outskirts of Uptown Charlotte, so parking is so much easier here."
0,"Let me start by saying I am not a picky person... But when 3 of the 4 plates on our table had dried food still on them ( mine actually had a cement dried chunk of chicken glued to the back of it )... I figured I had to write something.  The sheer filth didn't stop there... I took my kid into the bath room only to discover it hadn't been cleaned in something close to 10 years... My shoes were sticking to the floor from the stagnate urine, there was no towel paper and poop still in the toilet bowl.  After returning to the table, the waiter came over to apologize in broken English to tell me the dishwasher was really backed up... We ended up leaving as I couldn't eat another bite... This place is great if your looking for cheap and want to attempt getting food poisoning."
0,This place needs some work for sure! First off how do you not have the ball ramps for younger kids?? You mean to tell me they are all broken?? How frustrating! There were many parents that felt ripped off because of the simple fact that the children were displeased with not being able to bowl with the ramps. It's was a sore sight to see looming down the lanes that every young child was upset cause they couldn't bowl like they anticipated with the ramps. After having bare witness with my grand daughter being let down and disappointed I doubt I will ever return to this place. Can't go wrong with their competitors. One day not have the ramps for kids cost this place my future business.
1,"Hope this place doesn't go up in smoke with the statewide smoking ban. Excellent selection of drinks. Selection of cigars left A LOT to be desired. I can understand the mark-ups, but let's also be a bit reasonable. The music last night when we went in around 12ish was horrible. The DJ looked like he thought he was cool. Let's just let him keep thinking that. I don't know what kind of mood he was looking to set, but it was reminiscient of the music playing in the background when I had my wisdom teeth pulled. I'll spin better tracks and do it for free if Maduro will let me!"
0,Okay this place sucks. \n1. There was a rumor that there were 5 dollar pizzas and there wasn't any at all\n2. They said it would be 20 min and after 20 minutes they said to wait a couple more minutes (annoying!)\n3. They poured about three pounds of pepper on the pizza crust which is disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nLater i will NOT be back \n\nP.s. The place next store has great beaner candy
1,"Don't get me wrong! I love HK Star, but the service is really poor. I have been back twice since the UYE lunch and both times we have been ignored for normal requests, like more water, please, more order please etc.... One of the times was even on a Saturday. Therefore, I am taking 1 star down for the service, BUT I will continue to come here for lunch because it is just damn good as well as the price! \n\nBy the way, their crispy fried tofu with salt and pepper is to die for!"
0,Not so great. weird.
1,"Been here a couple times now and have to say I really like this place. Not because the fish quality is amazing or the rolls are great but because it goes everything well. Nothing is really outstanding but the price and the rest is just solid For a $20 price you get miso soup, salad, edamame, choice or tempura or gyoza, ice cream and all you can eat sushi. That is a great deal and the sushi list is huge featuring a ton of specialty rolls and nigiri. I have never left this place not feeling like I got more than my moneys worth even on nights where I ate light.\n\nAs for the food like I said it is solid but not spectacular. The fish isn't bad but isn't out of this world either. It's just good. Unlike some other AYCE places I am not afraid to try things on the menu here and venture out and I am a bit of a fish snob and won't do that unless i feel comfortable with the level of quality at a place. I have found some things I am not a fan of her but nothing i felt was bad quality or stale. I am a big fan of a few of the specialty rolls who's name escapes me but I think it's the mido roll and the ahha roll. Also i like there spicy scallop which I don't like most places.\n\nThe services is also good here and the place is clean. You really aren't going to go wrong for the price and really worth the try. Only reason I withhold a 5th star is because the fish is just average and at a sushi place that is my key grade. Of the AYCE places around though this one is a solid pick."
0,"only giving a two  because it's 247. drinks.. blah. espresso.. Bleh! someone walked off with my phone there too when i went to the bathroom. wtf!!! employees were extremely unhelpful when asked if they noticed anyone walk up to where i was sitting (plain view of the counter). i canceled the phone 30minutes later when i got home, six international calls made from it from the time it was walked off with.  don't bother trying to call this place either the phone doesn't get answered. or at least didn't. did I mention the espresso is BLEeh??"
1,"Best pad thai in town + it's cheap! \n\nThe place looks simple but don't be fooled, the meal quality is on par with the best (and much more expensive) places out there.\n\nThe owner is also very nice and full of energy.\n\nRecommended."
1,"Amazing salads! Some of the specials they run can be a bit pricy if you add meat but they are worth it. I would love if they opened earlier, around 6, for breakfast. I would stop by every day on my way to work!"
1,Didn't go into the bar area so this review is only for the dining room.\n\nPretty small dining room area but they packed in as many chairs/tables as possible. You order and pick up at the same counter so customer service is really negligible. It seems like a larger scale chipotle.\nSince you aren't reserving tables you can fit in a larger group (as long as you grab the seats as they become available). You can also stay as long as you want since you don't have to worry about a waiter rushing you to leave. Also each person can walk up to the counter and order their food so there is no mess with splitting the bill. \n\nTheir turkey burger with the cilantro mess on top was awesome. BF had the steak sandwich and he loved it. Everyone else in the party seemed to be happy with their food as well. \n\n\nDownside--wait was FOREVER!! And the chairs were just plain wood. Ouch. \n\nAlthough we had a pleasant experience...I'm not dying to go back again.
0,"This LV is still the best stocked LV I've been to. The last time I was here, I came with my family and they were waiting to use the restroom. One of the male employee came and told them they couldn't wait there and stood by them until they moved from the area. He acted like they were about to steal something. It was totally unprofessional."
1,This Ross is  a little nicer than all the other ones I've been to.  Good selection and familiar layout.\n\nThe registers are better laid out at this store and I really appreciate it because even when it's busy the line moves quickly!
0,"Not impressed. We waited a very long time for our food (which was perfectly fine but not worth long wait), when I nicely asked the floor manager why 4 tables seated after us had their food and we had not received ours, he told us \""your ticket said 11:05, it has only been 15 minutes...I can show you the ticket\""....I have 12yrs of food & beverage sales and hospitality experience and couldn't believe instead of just apologizing and discounting our drinks or something he tried to prove us wrong. Very bad way to handle a customer complaint. We are sorry we cheated on the Good Egg today, we will be back there next week instead of Henhouse Cafe."
0,"I think this restaurant lured the customers for their fish tank. I would not recommend this place even if you are hungry.I ordered seafood noodle soup, it was lukewarm, 3 shrimps in a bowl and  tasteless. It was very disappointing."
0,"Holes in bedroom walls dirty bathrooms. Fun to visit, not to stay! With so many casinos to stay in Vegas, it won't cost much to stay somewhere else."
1,"What a great place! I wasn't sure if I was going to like a Mexican-Asian fusion restaurant. I was skeptical. I'm happy to report I was pleasantly surprised! My friends told me that it's kind of like a tapas (small plate) menu, so we ordered a bunch of stuff & shared. First out was the \""bacon guacamole\"" which was tasty. Next out was \""tempura unagi roll\"" which was good as well. It reminded me a lot of a Las Vegas roll. We also had the \""crispy pork belly roll\"" which was different. It was pretty good, but I don't normally like pork belly. My friends really liked it though. I also ordered the \""Lobster & Crab Dynamite\"" which was delicious. For a drink I ordered the skinny margarita which was awesome. This is definitely a busy, \""where the cool people hang out\"" type place & I can't wait to try more things off the menu."
0,"Well, I went here with my mom, who is a huge sports enthusiast, so she really enjoyed it.  There were a ton of TVs and pretty much all the seats have a birdseye view of at least 10 of them, so it was all good.  We went kind of early in the day so there weren't many people dining, and for this reason you would think we'd have our food lickety-split.  Not so.  We waited quite a while for chicken tenders and a burger, i believe, and they weren't even that good when they arrived.  i did have a nice potent margarita to get the day going right, but overall food and beverage-wise i was kind of expecting more.  service was also somewhat lacking, despite it being early like i said.  and i felt strange entering the joint, since when we arrived i guess we interrupted some flirtatious he-ing and she-ing between several employees - so they just gave us these weird blank stares when we asked to be seated.  \""Uh, you are open, aren't you?\""......    Anyway, we happened to be there during the 08 summer Olympics and you would think some of those events would have been playing on the TVs, but again, not so.  They did have like 2 TVs on Olympic footage and the rest on baseball and other miscellany.  Now don't get me wrong, I like baseball, but its the freakin Olympics!  I was annoyed.  AND to top it off, the main reason mom was able to lure me there in the first place is they offer free Wi-Fi.  I however was not able to get this wi-fi to work, I don't know if it was due to some configuration or firewall on my laptop or what.  But the directions they give to access it were not helpful, nor were any of the employees who acted like they didn't know what an internet was, so be forewarned.  I lugged my 17in Vaio all the way from Paris (the hotel, not the city.  LOL) and was not particularly pleased when it turned out to be useless and had to be carried BACK to the hotel."
1,"My mother-in-law took my husband and myself here for his late birthday dinner. My husband says we are definitely going back.  He raved about it the whole time. As you can tell from previous reviews, he's not always a rave every restaurant kind of guy. \nThe portions are, as expected, Italian kitchen big. The food was delicious.  The ambiance was nice, yet casual. \n\nOverall: Delicious!!"

1,"Tried many Chinese buffets in town and this one is the best of the dozen or so in Vegas. They do have pretty fresh ingredients. They do switch some of their lunch dishes out during dinner so you don't feel like your paying more for only lunch items. For dinner you get more of the seafood dishes like, shrimps, mussels, lobsters, crabs and fish.  Overall taste of all the dishes is consistent. We've been dining at this buffet from time and time again for the past two years and haven't been disappointed. They do have a good selection of dishes, with a decent sushi, fresh fruits, dessert and a Mongolian BBQ station. It's more of a locals buffet so don't expect it to be like a fancy buffet at one of the strip's hotel. The food is good and the price is reasonable, what more can you ask for."
0,"Bad food,, very slow service. Did I say over priced. Save your money eat somewhere else.\n.basic hamburger taste bad. How does this place stay in business."
1,"Gaucho is beyond awesome. The meat is high-quality product, over-the-top well prepared. The staff is enthusiastic about what they do. The whole experience is like going to a good friend's house, discovering that some of your other friends have also come over, and then being served implausibly good food."
0,"the food is ok but I'm taking a star away because they don't have a croque madame for brunch.  unheard of for a \""French bistro\"".  I had the bistro burger with frites.  cooked nicely with high quality meat.  the bun could have been a little fresher but overall a decent meal.  dessert sucked.  we shared a \""key-lime cheesecake\"". between 3 of us, 75% of it was left on the plate.  it was a plain cheesecake (and not close to fresh).  the \""key-lime\"" aspect was a neon green jelly like substance squirted on top and around the cheesecake. hidioso."
1,Food was sooooo good! Service was great. I did think it was a bit dumb that in order to have happy hour you had to sit at the bar?  Thats just weird.
0,Came in at 700 pm Saturday night  place is clean  .  Waitresses were slow. Handling to many tables each\n30 minute ticket times   food was average    I'll skip next time ......
1,"Once again \""thank you\"" Trattoria Reggiano for making my dining experiences a pleasure each and every time I eat here.  Each time I visit Las Vegas I make it a point to eat here; although this year I was only able to make it in once.  The service is fantastic and the ambiance is certainly like visiting a small Italian restaurant in Italy.  \n\nIt is always a pleasure to see server John, whom I mostly always have wait on me, even if we have to wait for an open table in his area.  Also it was nice to see and say hello to Carl, who has also waited on me when John was off for the night.  The service was just as wonderful as always and it is so nice to have John and the other staff remembers me from year to year. \n\nThe new manager, Flavia, who has been there about 1 year, replaced the previous manager, Stephano, who went to one of the family's other restaurants.  Flavia was a just a pleasure to talk with and I enjoyed her.  I look forward to seeing her and the rest of the staff on my next trip.    \n\nMenu items chosen on this trip:\n\nArugula and Cherry Tomato Salad and Spaghetti Puttanesca.  Great salad and fantastic Spaghetti.  Be sure to stop by and have some garlic pizza dough rolls slathered with olive oil once you sit down."
0,"Grimaldi's, I love your food, but your customer service is horrible, therefore I am forced to rate you as a 1. Let's take last night as an example. I went to pick up my large pizza and a salad. I saw my pizza come out, I saw two guys opening the box,  looking at the pizza and discussing something. One guys comes over to me, quickly opens the lid and says \""isthisok?\"" (yup all in one word.) I said \""uhh yeah, I guess so\""... \""but wait it looks a little small to be a large.\"" He says - oh yeah it's between a medium and a large, but we will give you your salad for free. So, if I would have said \""yes, it looks fine,\"" they would have left me walk out of there with something less than what I paid for?! Plus now I have a pizza that will not fill up my family? When I ask for a new pizza he grudgingly says \""well its gonna take 20-25 minutes.\"" So, I leave... with a small pizza and a crappy wilted salad... and don't expect anyone to hold the door for you either... they are all too busy gabbing around the guest kiosk.\n\nPs- this is the 2nd time my order was messed up and I must say even Domino's and Pizza Hut have never messed up my pizza size or toppings!"
1,I LOVE this restaurant! I ate ate a lot of restaurants when visited Vegas and this was the one that stood out by far. When you come here you MUST get the mussels. They give you freshly baked baguettes that you can use to soak up the delicious buttery white wine broth. YUMMMM! French sangria was amazing too - who knew rosemary works in sangria?
1,Great food and serivce!
1,"Best Thai in Charlotte... The Owner can be arrogant sometimes, but the food is great... Red and green curries are best...\nPad Thai is good too...\nDinner takeout portion is big, 2 people can easily share one entree!!"
0,"The food was not bad, but the service was rather awful, which pushed this experience down to 2 stars.  And since \""not bad\"" food can be found in so many other locations, why bother coming to this rather tired seeming dining room?"
1,Was told by friends to try Barcelona Tapas & Bar and I owe them one.  Matt was are server and I just said to him bring us what you do well and the treats just kept coming.  Stuffed dates are amazing.  Go and enjoy.
1,"Best airport food I have had in years!!!!  Burgers were hot, big and done as I asked.  Fries were hot and better than most fries at airports or others! Servers were cheerful and helpful and made a point  to tell us about free refills on drinks. A great stop if you're hungry in the Phoenix airport!"
0,"I am a big fan of roast chicken and had passed by this place several times...well, tonight I decided to give it a try since it's in my neighborhood. My chicken was anything but tender and juicy, quite the opposite, it was tough and dry, no flavor or anything. I tried the potatoes...same thing...the carrot salad was kind of gunky and tasted like orange-flavor Tang or Kool-Aid. I really don't understand all the whoop about  Coco Rico. The cherry on the cake: they don't take credit cards or worldwide-accepted debit cards such as Maestro or Visa Electron (maybe the owner should step into the 21st century) and the Spanish-speaking girl at the cash register has a surly attitude...so for me this will be my only visit to Coco Rico. I can get better roast chicken and side dishes at the supermarket downstairs and pay with my credit/debit cards."
0,"Out of town visitors and we stopped for lunch.  My wife and I along with her niece at 12:00.  We had a hamburger, onion rings with tea -- a Cobb salad with tea and a chili dog with a Pepsi to eat at the restaurant.  The \""waitress\"" .... Sigh.   She brought me my hamburger.  That's it.  Then she brought the Pepsi.   Then she brought the salad and chili dog.  Then she brought two iced teas.  Then I had to ask for silverware -- you would have thought I had asked for a new car with her very poor attitude.  I asked about my onion rings -- nothing.  I waited 15 more minutes -- nothing.  I then went inside and spoke directly with Jim who made me a fresh order in less than two minutes.  \n  The \""waitress\"" needs a MAJOR attitude adjustment -- not to mention a tray to hold an entire order.  The current system of filling an order is a joke.  On the plus side, the food -- as it arrived piece by piece -- was very good."
1,"It's not enough to say they have the best happy hour in North Scottsdale - and, oh, they do - let me tell you why.  First, the place looks so good it makes even me look good in it.  The entrance is a long walkway surrounded by floor to ceiling windows behind which are hundreds of wine bottles stacked, well, floor to ceiling. The staff all ooze cool while at the same time executing some of the most solicitous service I can think of in town right now.  Their signature cocktails are amazing, and their bartenders know just the right way to make them.  At $8 a pop during HH, that's a mighty fine deal for top shelf liquor done right.  Food is $7 on the HH menu, so of course we tried just about every one, and they were outstanding.  Ok, I have to fess up, the lobster mac & cheese was really boring, but that was the only boring thing this evening.  I guess they have live music some nights, and I hear they're thinking about offering bourbon flights.  Bourbon flights??  That's a bit beyond my league, but it could be fun to watch.  \n\nBest of all, Bourbon Steak's HH goes until 7, which gives me plenty of time to fill up on the value menu and still get my old butt home in time to crash at a decent hour."
0,"Everything about the pedi was ok except the polishing part.  12 hours later I had to wear shoes, and the polish smudged because it was slopped on so thick it never would have dried. \n\nAs she was polishing my nails, I was thinking, \""Man, that is way too thick!  It'll never dry!\"", but I didn't say anything because I thought maybe she had some super topcoat that would make the impossible possible.  Well, she didn't, and the polish stayed not just tacky, but downright WET for 4 hours, before I finally just SCRAPED the goop off and painted them myself.  \n\nI will never be back, and wish I had saved my $30 (I had a Groupon) and my $15 tip.  Should have just done them myself."
0,The worst burger king I ever been to ! I love burger king and the wackest one is by my house (this one). Its empty for a reason and the employees seem careless. Service is slow  even if your the only customer. Food isnt fresh . Shameful.
1,"Happen to find this place when my friend had recommended me to her stylist that was right next door at Joleon Salon. I am actually the MOH for my cousin's wedding and recommended the same stylist and also made an appointment to check out the dresses here.\n\nThey had a great selection from a variety of brands.   \n\nThe girls here were nice. And we were actually able to find THE dress. And happens to be on a weekend when there was a sale! So my bride put down a credit card to hold the dress and went back for measurements and order, hope the rest goes well. So far, good to go!"
1,"Straight up, we did not eat a meal here, we ate dessert only and had drinks.  \n\nBeing only a stone throw from my sister's house and open until late, it was a perfect spot when we decided to do a late dessert before I left early the next morning back home.  At 10:30 pm, the run a \""late night menu\"" which had limited yet with variety selection of entrees and desserts.  It also had some recommended drinks. \n\nBeing a non-drinker, I have to go by the drinkers' opinions which were that the drinks were good. Upon investigation of the drink menu, an obscure ingredient made these two Hawaii girls go, hmmm. Li hing mui. Upon further investigation we found out that the bartender was originally from Hawaii.  Cool point. \n\nDessert... ah, even on this late menu, was unique and interesting.  At this late hour, one would be forgiving if a place just offered a slice of pie with ice cream on the side. Not here.  The were individually prepared and it took time to get it.  \n\nI'll say this much, when an employee/our server knows all the owners and their history, points them all out at 10:30 on a weeknight, and gushes about their hard work, ability to collaborate and be original; you as business owners, are doing something right.   \n\nOverall it seems that this place is ambitious and willing to take the risk, exert the extra energy and push the bill to get people to see that they are not a joke when it comes to creating an original experience.  I can safely say this, on this Tuesday night, by the time we left at about midnight, the place was even more crowded then when we came.    I am definitely coming back again to try their regular menu."
1,"My friend had a Groupon ready to expire and was awesome enough to share it with me.  I've lived here all my life and always thought of Vincent's as a place our grandparents would all hang out at.  The decor looks like it, but that's ok.  It's a French restaurant and definitely not geared toward yup's.  The food and service were still fantastic.\nWe started with the foie gras and duck tamales.  Duck tamales at a French restaurant seemed a little strange on the menu; so we were intrigued to order.  They tasted like duck tamales.  They were good.  The foie gras was awesome.  We were also brought the most delicious croissants I have ever had.\nFor our main courses, I had the lamb and my friend had the wild boar.  My lamb was fantastic and came with yummy potatoes and green beans.  The wild boar was good.  If you are curious what while boar tastes like; it tastes like pork.  Lamb is one of my favorite meats and this was definitely one of my favorite times eating lamb.  \nWe finished off with desserts.  I ordered the profiteroles and my friend had a grand marnier souffle.  You really only need to order one dessert per four people.  They are large.  The profiteroles were tasty and very rich.  I couldn't come close to finishing them.  The souffle was actually two souffles.  I've never had a souffle before so can not really say if it was a good souffle or not.  It tasted like eggs.  My friend said they are supposed to.  The chef brought us out complimentary flour less chocolate cake.  That was delicious.  It would have been amazing with some vanilla ice cream on top.\nThe food was amazing and I will definitely be back when in the mood for some French cuisine or even just for some wine and desserts.  I would recommend as a great place to take your mom for her birthday too."
0,"I don't know about you, but I'm a bit tired of just about ANYBODY being able to buy an L&L Hawaiian Barbecue franchise...then sending it to $h!+.  Seriously, a lot of you L&L owners are doing it WRONG.  If you're not Hawaiian or a resident from Hawaii, fine.  But dammit, some of you HAOLE (foreigner) owners are ruining the Hawaii restaurant's name!  Please, please, PLEASE learn about Hawaiian culture and Hawaiian ways!  Read a book.  Hire at least a Hawaii resident or two for good measure.  Why are just about NONE of the L&L Hawaiian Barbecues here in the mainland nothing like the ones back in Hawaii?  I'll tell you:\n\n1) Food\n2) Service\n\nSimple but means so much.  I love how the owners of the original L&L Drive-Inn back in Honolulu came from humble beginnings to now being some of the richest people in all of Hawaii.  Hard work, perseverance, and the spirit of entrepreneurship paid off for them in spades.  For them they deserve great props.  But something just comes off as not inspiring when you branch out too much from your roots.  I wish there was more scrutiny when selecting new franchisees!  They can affect a brand name so much!  I get concerned because back in my island days of Maui I used to eat L&L quite a bit, it's like fast-food comfort for locals.  The food then was simple, uncomplicated, plentiful, affordable, and made with some form of integrity.  Most times you knew the cook, the cashier, the help staff.  Eating at L&L was one heck of a pleasure and a treat back home when I was younger.  Why?  Because livin' in Hawaii is HAHD.  Yes HAHD.  Most of us locals 'no can' eat out that often since food so expensive...restaurant dining was something you looked forward to.  \n\nSo I care a lot when places like this become a bit 'bastardized' and start to lose the love.  Where is the love?  Sorry Black Eyed Peas, it ain't here.  I hate to say it, but the recent incarnations of L&L Hawaiian Barbecue are lacking authenticity.  Lacking punch.  NO MO' LOVE!  I am happy but at the same time I am sad.  While the original owners surely get lots of kickback for each L&L franchise started, a little piece of my childhood dies inside.  It cries, then dies.  Then dies again for dramatic effect.  \n\nWe went here because this is the closest L&L by our house.  Tucked in a former diner, this L&L is just a fa\u00e7ade of what lies inside.  A mess.\n\nI'll start with the service.  Seems this L&L (like many of them) is owned by yet another Chinese family.  All of the employees that day were Chinese, which I mean no disrespect (I myself am 1/8 Chinese), but many of them were just not very welcoming.  Our cashier wasn't rude, but she wasn't exactly inviting either.  The cooks were hastily shouting out orders in Chinese, and food was constantly just being slopped into containers.  I suppose since it was busy all of us were being hurried along so our cashier could get orders in.  Not even a real \""Hello\"" or \""Welcome to L&L\"" when we entered.  Where is the local girl with the flower in her hair at the register that was always happy to see us when I was little?  Nani?  Lani?  Puanani?  No where in sight I'm afraid.  Like a candle in the wind goes my fond memories.\n\nEven looking at the menu it's just not the same.  My nostalgia is kicking in but the prices for the food at L&L are kinda getting out of hand.  Really, like $8-$9 for a regular plate?  Even more if you like beef?  Whoa, brah!  Thought L&L was supposed to be a deal for families?  Expensive for what you get.\n\nNext we'll go with the food.  I ended up getting my staple of a Chicken Katsu regular plate.  The wifey got the L&L Hawaiian BBQ Mix with teri chicken, teri beef, and short ribs.  The kid got a cheeseburger and fries combo with a drink.  \n\nOverall?  Really below average.  Thankfully the rice was Calrose and it was made decently.  The macaroni salad was CRAP, too much on the watery side and not enough flavor.  I added extra shoyu, pepper, and Tabasco to liven it up.  The entrees?  Not so great.  Chicken katsu looked golden brown on the outside but was pretty flavorless.  Would it kill you guys to season the chicken before you fry it?  The katsu sauce was thumbs down, another mixture of ketchup with who knows what.  This is why I often carry a bottle of decent katsu sauce (like Bulldog) if I know I want katsu.  Wife's BBQ Mix plate?  She didn't like it.  Too little food, and not flavored correctly.  What is up with the SUPER thin slices of beef, chicken, and short rib?  Small serving that left her hungry.  The kid's cheeseburger?  MEH, just a cheeseburger.  Not even a hand made patty like we used to have back at L&L (or just about any Mom & Pop eatery) in Hawaii.  Bun wasn't even toasted!  Fries were just plain crinkle cut.\n\nI wasn't gonna even bother with authentic Hawaiian eats like a bowl of saimin or a Spam Musubi.\n\nThis L&L is just all kinds of depressing for me.  Mr. Kam & Mr. Flores, if you guys are still around please visit your stores and bring back the Aloha Spirit!"
1,"Fromagerie Copette Et Cie is the kind of small-gem shop which is helping Verdun to reinvent itself from a so-so neighborhood to a stellar one. Walking by everyday on my way to work, it's quite a welcome site seeing the stacks of fresh baguettes and loaves of fresh bread heaped high in the window and then steadily decrease as the day goes on.\nThat's exactly how a proper bread shop should work.\n\nThen there is the cheese counter and like other reviewers indicated, if you're not sure of the cheeses you're looking for, a tiny sample is usually offered to help you figure out what your tastes are.  \n\nThere's also a counter with cured meats and hams, a freezer full of meat pies and another counter full of pates, real smoked bacon, and rillette du canard, probably the single most amazing meat spread which you can pair up with your baguette. They have also started up with some sweetbreads like croissants and other goodies. No joke the brownies here are the best in town and sell out very quickly. \n\nMake sure you come by on Sundays, they make fresh, warm Belgian-styled waffles which are also usually gone by 1pm."
0,"After three years of shopping here, I'm done.  They implemented a store redesign that's so perversely illogical that customers find a new camaraderie in helping each other find where products are, because they're not where any thinking person would have put them.  It's like a giant game of \""Concentration\"" where you have to try to remember where you might have seen what it is you're looking for now, when you were wandering the aisles looking for something else earlier.  Utterly ridiculous, thoroughly infuriating, and a complete waste of my time.  I'm done.  Albertson's is only a mile away."
1,"I really love the pizza here. Service is hit or miss. My only complaint is the prices. They are way too high for casa.  We stopped going when they stopped the specials. If they cleaned the place up to make the atmosphere less divey, it might help also. Large Chad's special (14 inch pizza), a couple sodas, tax and tip is thirty bucks.\nGood pizza, but better get it to go..."
1,"I've eaten majority of their menu and haven't found anything that I haven't liked.  It's a great place for any meal.  My boyfriend is more a breakfast person and I'm more of a lunch person so this place is perfect for us.  I love their avocado pizza - we did it with proscuitto once and it was fantastic.  The spicy tuna roll makes a great appetizer.  The white sangria is probably one of the best I've had in Phoenix.  For dessert, the red velvet cupcake is unbelievable - the frosting is the best part.  The parking kinda stinks but you can always park across the street at arcadia room and walk to LGO.  Can't say how much I love this place!"
0,"We order out from there once in awhile at work, and since the remodel, they act like the customer does not matter. First they got the order wrong, and then charged double for a couple of the items. When we called them to notify of the charges, they stated that this was the correct price and the ones on the internet menu are wrong. For a matter of $5 that they refused to refund and dismissed the issues with our order, they have lost at least 10 customers from our place of work as I will order from another place instead. Very very disappointed as I loved this place when I first ate there. At my old job, I ate there once a week. No mas!"
1,Myst\u00e8re is WOW just WOW! I didn't know what to expect from this show but there are many interesting acts. And each individual performing has major talent. \n\nThere are so many colors and acrobatic moves. There is also comedy here and there and they even get some of the audience involved. It is a very entertaining show and if you have kids they will enjoy it too. No wonder why this show is still going on after so many years. It's a definite success!
0,"Came here for new brake pads on my front two wheels. After having new brake pads installed I left happy. However, down the road a few blocks I couldn't stop! Come to find out there was air in the system. The place I took it to also informed me that my back brakes were crumbling. Brake masters never even checked! Usually the guys check everything out and tell you what's going bad etc. not this place...they will let you drive off and possibly kill yourself in an accident. Do not go here and do not send your loved ones here. They just may die on the way out... Seriously I'm not trying to be dramatic, that incident was scary!"
0,"What is it about the anonymous Chinese buffet that draws me, like a moth to a flame, knowing full well that I will be disappointed?  I suppose the 2 or 3 good experiences I have had, ever, at any Chinese buffet, anywhere, have spawned within me an eternal optimism - that I will stumble into a beautiful buffet table full of home-cooked Chinese food, tasty and tasteful.\n\nIn reality, it seems that 98% of Chinese buffets serve the same stock dishes, with varying levels of mediocrity.  The orange chicken here was actually tasty; everything else was greasy, super salty, and, sometimes, lukewarm.  There were about 8 dishes total, with the usual fried accouterments, plus the worst sushi I have ever had in my entire life.\n\nIf you are desperate and pressed for time, this place will do - otherwise, avoid, and spend your $7 somewhere else."
0,"The Habitat for Humanity ReStore is a great idea, but it never really lives up to its potential. Honestly, I've never gone in here and found something I could use in my house. I've heard that the occasional good piece can be found, but it seems to be rare unless you frequent this place weekly or so. The book store/coffee place is really the only part that is quality. Many old, dated fixtures, not much of anything else. Prices are average, but they seem a bit high for what I see...I don't know, it seems better can be found at your typical neighborhood goodwill or thrift store."
0,"We asked our rental car shuttle driver for a nearby good reataraunt, this was his suggestion.\n\nWe found that there were NO fresh vegetable options, nearly everything was fried and loaded with grease. \n\nI would compare this with any cheap roadside diner in California except with a southern menu......\n\nThe server was pleasant, but she could offer no help as to what to order as she was vegetarian and had not eaten much from the menu.\n\nNot so good for dinner, maybe better for hangover breakfasts"
1,"I am there nearly every night for the 8:30pm show.  Everyone on our tours is impressed with the Sirens show.  Even more when weather does not allow a show to happen, the guests can take pictures with the Sirens and the Pirates. \n\nOur passengers like this.  One man with his little son asked the pirates to strike a pirate type of pose for a picture, and they gladly did.  I don't know them all by name accept Brett. But everyone of the guys and the beautiful girls put it all on the line for the enjoyment of the guests.  \n\nThank you Sirens and Pirates.."
1,"Went here for a date night with the hubby. We were staying in this hotel and didn't want to veer too far from the sleeping kiddos. It has nice open area seating with a huge bar right when you walk in.  They have complimentary bread that was just okay. \n\nOur server was pretty good. He was actually the bartender (i think). He was somewhat aloof but efficient none the less. Our food was excellent! We had the fried calamari and scallop appetizer. The scallops were my fave dish of the whole meal. Very elegantly plated and each component on the plate had a purpose.  A bit pricey, though for 3 pieces of scallops ($15).\n\nFor main dishes, we had a veal dish and chicken parm. The portions were surprisingly large. I didn't mind paying a little more for the quality and quantity we received. But it's Vegas! You have to expect paying outrageous prices. \n\nLastly, we had the gelato that is prepared in house. The strawberry basil was especially memorable. Melt in ypur mouth, creamy strawberry taste with a hint of basil taste."
0,"We made a reservation online.  Arrived and we were seated right away.  That's where the good service ended.  The service was very poor and super slow.  My husband ordered a glass of wine when the waiter finally arrived to take our drink order.  His took 15 minutes to arrive and when they did bring his I decided to get one also.  It took 30 minutes for my glass of wine to arrive!  55 minutes for food.  Were never asked if we wanted a refill and had to flag down the waiter for more water.  No one ever came back to ask if everything was ok, how was the food, did we need anything.  Food was decent, not spectacular but it took almost 90 minutes for two people to have dinner.  Although the food was ok the whole experience was pretty poor.  Not sure if we will ever go back."
1,"A true gem hidden off the Vegas strip.  A co-worker recommended this place after eating here every night during his stay here.  I've eaten here once a week so far. \n\nThe izakaya style food is so unique, flavors I've never had before.\n\nMy favorites are the poached egg with sea urchin and ikura with yamaimo, and of course the homemade tofu special (one is cold and the other is agedashi style). The cold special udon with foie gras chawanmushi style in broth was just exquisite.\n\nI always eat way too much that I can never fit in the desserts I want to try out - fluffly cheesecake. Well I'll be sure to try it next week I'm there.  Finding hidden gems like this place makes it bearable working here every week on a project in Vegas.\n\nBy the way, this place closes at 3am!!! And it looks like the owner is expanding his restaurant to the space next door."
1,"I liked this place. It's incredibly odd. It's a pharmacy, 50's diner, record store and general store all in one. \n\nGet the breakfast!!! And their shakes are so good."
0,"Date/Time:  Saturday - 7:30pm\nOccasion:  Dinner with daddy and little brother\nParty of:  Three\nLocation:  Typical Chinese restaurant. Simple decor. Not the cleanest\nOrdered:  Westlake Beef Soup, Flamebroiled Pepper-Beef Steak, Ginger Chicken, and Seafood-Tofu claypot\nTotal incl gratuity: ~$\n\nExpensive.  Definitely gone down-hill.  And quite simply put, not worth it.  The only thing worth mentioning was the soup.  The pepper beef steak was sliced way too large and quite difficult to chew.  The ginger chicken was terribly dry.  And I wasn't interested in taking another bite of the seafood tofu claypot.\n\nTo top it off, each entree ran $12 - $18.  $60 for four entrees at a Chinese restaurant?? Definitely not worth it it!  I've typically gone here for lunch and ordered noodles.  Now I'm scared and likely not to return.  I'm going to stick with pho in Chinatown from now on.  Fellow yelpers: any suggestions on other better Chinese restaurants in the area? ;)"
1,"4 stars for the price, but overall great service and close to home....and you get a ribbon (girl) or bandana (boy) for your dog! They always do a good job with my dog (Shih tzu) and they pay enough attention that they told me once that my dog had an ear infection. Petsmart always disappointed me with the Way they treated my dog and the sloppy work they do."
1,"Food is exceptional! Being a foodie as well as a local business owner, I search for local establishments that have great product/service. Park Central is in this category. The food is fresh, well prepared, affordable, and even when there is a line, you will be in and out within 5 minutes. Great job Mark and thanks for the great service. Also, order the buffalo wing wrap with ranch and the pasta salad, awesome stuff!"
0,"I stayed at the Wyndham this past weekend and have mixed feelings about it.\n\nThe lobby and the front desk staff, upon arrival, really impressed me. I thought they were friendly and wished me an enjoyable stay - off to a good start. I arrived in the room which was in great condition. I didn't think it was run down as a few of the other reviews stated. Besides, a room is just a room - how much time do you spend in there anyway?\n\nI throw my stuff down... and, of course, head right for Primanti Bros. My plan was to jump right in a cab - on a Friday night at a hotel, it should be no problem getting a cab. Well... there are no cabs to be found. This isn't necessarily the hotel's fault, because I found out that apparently, cabs in Pittsburgh are hard to come by. HOWEVER, the bellhops and the valet guys did not tell me this. Instead, they say that one will come around soon. Not only did a cab not come, but the bellhops didn't tell us that the hotel offers a free shuttle service anywhere within 3 miles of the place. HELLO!? Now would be a great time to tell me that!!!\n\nRoom service: 2 bagels, 2 orange juices = about $30. INSANE.\n\nAt checkout, I was supposed to receive a special rate - buy one night, get the second half off. They charged me full price for the second night at checkout. Had I not examined the receipt carefully, I wouldn't have noticed. Bullshit.  I brought it up and they quickly took a look at the computer and fixed it. \n\nOverall - mixed feelings."
1,"My wife and I saw this show Nov 2013 and we really enjoyed it. The MC is the guy with the Birds from Americas Got Talent and he is okay as the host. The acts are kind of short but they are good. I would recommend it and it is good for families. I wish the magic was a little longer, but what we saw was fantastic. VIP tickets are not needed because the theater is not that big so views are okay anywhere pretty much."
1,"Between myself and my husband, we've been to dozens of local and tourist bars all over the valley. I can, without a doubt, say that Oak & Ivy is the best bar I've ever been to! If you're looking for craft cocktails or even a beer, a great environment, and wonderful company, this is the place! You're welcome to read my (long) review below if you want to know more. \n\nThe Location: Located at the Container Park, which is only a block from Fremont, Oak & Ivy is close for tourists, but far enough away from the Vegas hustle and bustle for locals. During the day, all hard alcohol must stay on the premises, but you're able to walk around, shop, and eat if you're only having beer. Whether you want to explore the park, or hang out inside with other patrons and the bartenders, you'll have a good time!\n\nThe Staff: Every single bartender at Oak & Ivy is wonderful! They are all knowledgable and able to make whatever you throw at them. They are even willing and able to recommend cocktails you've never experienced based on your preferences. However, Pinto is my fav. He has proven that I can love gin and Bloody Mary's along with given me recommendations on how to \""wow\"" others when I make cocktails! Never had a bad convo or cocktail when I've stopped in!\n\nThe Drinks: Although they specialize in craft cocktails and whiskey, there is something for everyone here. Multiple beers are on tap and in bottles. They mix up they're menu with signature cocktails (like a pumpkin inspired Sleepy Hollow) and have they're most popular drinks like the coveted Moscow Mule with house made ginger beer. If you're feeling more inspired/adventurous, challenge them to make you something wild or let them decide on a drink for you! You simply can't go wrong."
0,I have not been here since 8/10/12. Today we stopped by and had lunch. The food tasted good the service was good but about 20-30 minutes after eating we were all sick. We had bad cramps and to put it nice it was coming right out. Don't think I will be back called and left a message to have a manager call but never heard anything back from one. Will let you know if I hear anything.
1,"I personally love the Farmer's Daughter burger. That with a individually brewed ice tea really is great on a hot day. It's a fun little spot and if you don't mind sitting at the counter with you friends, it can be great for a quick lunch.\n\nI'm excited for the fall when sitting outside on the patio won't be horrible and then the seating will effectively more than double. I come here probably one a week for a bite, and hope you'll check it out."
1,"Cornbread!! So yummy.  We took our friend visiting here for some \""soul food\"" and Mert's did not disappoint.  Come with an appetite!"
0,"The food is good, not excellent.  Stay away feom getting your food delivered, you will wait 1.5 hours and every time they will forget at least half your order. If the kitchen is this understaffed,  hire more people. I will NEVER order from here again because the last 3 times the service was late, they forgot half the order and its just not worth it."
0,"Great products but horrible service.\n\nI purchased the Durmafilm UV windshield tint which is a great product. The first time I was there I waited about 1 hour and was told my vehicle was finished so I paid. Turns out they did not install it! The owner was nice enough to have his staff work with me to remedy the situation (which is the only reason I am giving them 2 stars). This time they installed the product but made a mess out of my vehicle; they had soaked my leather interior in the installation solution that they use (dash, gauges and front seats) and did not even bother to even do a quick wipe down and had left shoe prints all over the front interior as well. And they had also left a few presents on my floor boards, 3 broken razor blades.\n\nAlthough they do have great products I would avoid this shop since their installation technicians have no consideration for you or your vehicle."
1,"I really wanted to give 5 stars on food alone but the service was just okay.. I got the rosemary filet with asparagus and it was probably one of the best steaks I have ever had.  We also got the sampler dip platter, that was delicious as well."
1,"I came here yesterday with Megan for a pedicure and I'm glad that I did! I've known about this place for a while, and it's located in a great little shopping area.  We had an apt for 12:45 and we got there a little early.\n\nThey do everything here, hair, nails, you name it!  The staff is really friendly and took great care of us.  We went into the back room where they do the manicure's and pedicure's and got set up at our station.  We were offered a few different type scrubs and I went with the mint. I don't remember what scrub Megan got but I know she liked it!  We chose our colors and I went with a deep red and Megan went with orange for her fav football team!!!\n\nThey had us soak our feet and started working on us right away.  The ladies who worked on us were so good, I feel like I really got taken care of.  My feet look awesome, and I feel great. Mind you, I have extremely dry cracked feet, and they hurt at times.  Mostly the damage is on my heals, so I always tell the pedicurist to take extra care.  \n\nBut you know what's awesome?  Here's where they won me over:  she recommended a repair product called glysolid to fix my heels and even used some on my feet to help fix my cracked nasty heals. Why is this a big deal? Well, it's simple.  No matter what product I've used it's to \""over the counter\"" and to weak to fix the damage that has ensued after living in sandals for 8 years in the valley of the sun.  My heals used to be worse back in the day, but since I'm good about getting pedicures, they've gotten somewhat better over the years, but my right heal just won't fix itself.  No other pedicurist has ever given me a product recommendation to actually make a difference. I could actually feel the cream working while it soaked in at the chair.\n\nIf you get a chance, spend the few extra dollars to come here and get your feet did.  You will thank yourself later and be glad that you did.  Thank you megan and Madison day spa for being awesome and helping me look at feel better!!"
0,Had mimosas and breakfast sandwiches here. Our server lacked customer service skills. Our $13 breakfast sandwiches came out in to-go boxes and and bags. Wish I would have gone to Starbucks instead. I can get the same sandwich for 1/2 the price there and better service.
0,"No more love from me for the Luxor.  This is a prime example of what happens when a huge corporation (MGM) buys everything in its wake (the Luxor).  Quality and value for your money have gone completely downhill.  I just got back from a week's stay there and believe me, I won't be back.  I made the mistake of staying in one of their Pyramid Spa Suite rooms (I always thought that the words \""suite\"" and \""spa\"" would mean something good.  How wrong I was!).  The room was cramped and narrow.  The air conditioning was almost non-existant.  And don't get me started on the spa tub that I paid extra for....\n\nThe bedspread and carpet had those mystery stains that DataLine NBC would have a field day with.  Food at the Luxor is less than passable.  Also, is it common to now spend 35 minutes on line to check in?  If it isn't, please send a memo to the Luxor.\n\nIf I ever go back to Las Vegas, I will be staying at the Wynn."
0,I stopped in to inquire about the price for a haircut because I only need it shaved with clippers. I normally do it myself but I can't right now with my hurt hand. All I got was attitude and how much is rent cost. No customer service and I don't want to see what he would do to my hair.
0,"I'm not really a fan.  The country cute decor is something I can get over but the food was overpriced, the service sucked and the place was super dirty.  We were sitting right next to the owners and if you can't get good service when sitting next to the big boss - it's a sign of trouble.  I would have given a 3 star but used the bathroom before leaving.  Well, I went into the bathroom anyways... didn't use it.  Totally disgusting and I have a feeling the kitchen isn't much better.  They should serve eggs-Benedict and french roast coffee to work with the country decor.  The place could be a gem but instead it's just a crapper"
0,Been wanting to try this for a long time.  I'm a HUGE mexican fan but this fell short of landing on a top favorite list.  Chips and salsa were fantastic and our waiter was very courteous and attentive. I ordered the beef tacos-price was extremely high for what you get and there was no flavor to the meat.  The corn tortilla was drenched in greasy oil and just a big snooze of what was inside.  Rice and beans were descent but thats not hard to get right.  No plans to go back.\nThe price to park at the epicenter is redonkulous and they do not validate at this restaurant.
0,"I've only tried this branch of the restaurant, and only once - but I'm not likely to be back for awhile, if ever, so thought I would share.\n\nI grew up in a small farm town in California populated by lots of workers who migrated through from Mexico all year round. My friend circles included their kids from school, and so I became acquainted with Mexican cooking early on, and after living all over Southern and Northern California for 30 years, experienced great examples from all the various regional styles. \n\nWhat this place offers reflects a very Americanized, dumbed down version of Mexican cooking, but is more miss than hit. Burritos and enchiladas were more dry and bland than they should be for TexMex. Guacamole was OK, salsas were not nearly hot enough. However, I don't blame them too much for these shortfalls. NYC is pretty bad in this regard as well. \n\nWhere the restaurant can and does shine - at least on my trip through - were in its tacos. Pork was moist, steak was succulent, fish (fried version) was the wacky California style abomination that I remember and loved. Sure, the tortillas could have been better - like made fresh, which they weren't - but they weren't awful. The margarita on the rocks was pretty good too. \n\nStay clear of all the other stuff and stick with the tacos and you will be happier than not."
0,"I rarely write reviews, however, our experience here was so unpleasant that I wanted to share it with potential customers. \n\nMy experience on day shifts has been okay, although I agree with Brent V. that the service has been slow, and \""uncaring\"". However, the other evening my wife and a family friend went in to get a late night bite on the Graveyard shift. The main area is smoky to the point of causing nausea, and we went into the \""sealed\"" dining room. My wife and her friend went up to the Bartender, Dan, to ask if it would be okay if we ate in the dining area; we'd be willing to pick up the food at the bar. I waited in the dining area. \n\nWhat I overheard was possibly the most insulting bit of customer service that I have ever experienced. After my wife asked if we could eat in the dining area, Dan said, \""You two are in the wrong place, you need to leave!\"" After he reiterated his feeling that the women had no business in the establishment (this conversation took less than 30 seconds), I decided I would go see what was going on. I asked Dan, \""What is going on?\"", to which he said, \""Are you with those two girls?\"". I said, \""Yes\"" and Dan said, \""You need to leave, you're 86'd\"". \n\nI was flabbergasted! I assured Dan that I would be making my displeasure known, and he said, \""Good luck with that\"".\n\nOrdinarily, I would approach the owner about this type of behavior, however, short of terminating Dan, there isn't anything that \""The Wives\"" could do to assuage my displeasure. Maybe he feels because he had a decent sized crowd around the video poker bar (I'm sure due to his charming personality) that he is untouchable. I don't know. All I know is that until the day comes that I hear, or receive an email that Dan has been summarily terminated I will not return to that establishment, and I will tell everybody I know about my experience with him."
1,Wow this BBQ is the best!!! I had searched for this place on the Internet because I had been here years ago and it was a themed restaurant  .....Bobby McGees where the wait staff was dressed in character. When we arrived we were told that they quit doing that 8 yrs ago ;( They told us we would not be sorry if we stayed and they were right. It was by far the best BBQ ever!! Melted in your mouth. I told them I was looking on yelp to see if others loved them too and that they did!!! Then our excellent friendly server told us we got 10% off for mentioning yelp!! Wooo hoo icing on the cake.
0,"This place sucks. The customer service is horrible. They dont serve food unless you order a pizza from a neighboring restaurant. Who does that? They dont control their crowd. Many times I've gone I've seen fights. The bartenders suck - I've almost got in a fight with one because she was a complete bitch. Refused to serve me a drink because she was \""busy\"" celebrating her friends birthday BEHIND THE BAR. This place is ridiculous. I will NEVER go there again.. EVER."
1,"awesome dumplings and delicious soup ! also i had the orange chicken and it tasted awesome! fast service great food, perfect lunch!"
0,"My assumption is that this place is supported exclusively by dog lovers.  It sure can't be the food.  I came here for lunch and got a pizza and salad combo. \n\nThe pizza was bland but tolerable (the old \""pizza is like sex\"" joke is apt).  However, the salad made me feel like I had teleported back to Iowa in 1973.  They use ONLY iceberg lettuce on their salad.  What sort of restaurant does that in this day and age?  I thought maybe that it was just the side salad that was this way, but a coworker got a \""Fajita Salad\"", and it was also just iceberg.  The fajita salad appears to basically be iceberg and cheap-looking grated cheddar.  It also had a side of chicken and grilled peppers and onions, but those looked rather sparse.\n\nThe atmosphere is a bit too Disney-ish (read: juvenile) to make this a good bar to drink at, and the food is pretty mediocre.  Again, I have to assume that people who are obsessive dog lovers cannot resist coming here because there are so many adorable dog photos on the walls.  I, however, am just a dog liker.  Therefore, I can and will resist Uncle Bears."
0,"If you are into crooked haircuts and terrible customer service, this is your salon."
1,Wowza!!! This place is amazing...The pizza is super delish. Husband and I shared a small pizza with two toppings. $18 bucks. And we still had two slices left. A small is more like a medium. I am excited they opened one in Los Angeles. I found my new pizza joint :)
0,"I have only been here a couple of times, however that was enough to determine that Mad Mex is far superior in every way.Had nachos with chicken as an appetizer-rather flavorless and nothing special.I ate the \""3 amigos\"" as my entree-1 beef minitaco, 1 carnitas minitaco, and 1 chicken minitaco. They were all very bland, the tortillas were soggy, and frankly the beef taco was inedible.Everything I have ever ordered at Mad Mex has been very tasty so since they are both so close to eachother in shadyside-walking distance in decent weather-I see absolutely no need to go to Steel Cactus-head right to Mad Mex!"
0,Horrible customer service..Never expect the cab to be in time.. They cannot tell when they can assign a driver and we have been stranded for around 2 hours till a cab finally decides to arrive
1,"If u like all u can eat quality sashimi, crab claws, oysters, soup noodles, shrimp and more, this is the place. It was very quiet and elegant place with great service. Little pricey but worth it if you like seafood. You also get to order one entree each which was really good. This place is all about quality and freshness."
0,More expensive than Petsmart or Walmart. They do have a few things that the two former stores do not carry.\n\nPoor customer service. Employees are weird. Sometimes they talk to each other instead of the customer...while the customer is right in front of them at the cash register. \n\nThey now have an attached grooming service. I don't know. I have just about given up on this place. Would be surprised if they are still around in 6 months.
0,"Surprisingly this was going to be a 4 star review for a very clean hotel with more than adequate accommodations for a very cheap price.  I booked a room at the last minute for $12 on Expedia. Of course I expected to get hit with a Resort Fee, but $20? Give me a break!\nIt's time some government regulators put a stop to this Resort Fee BULLSHIT! It started out as an insignificant $3-4 added to the daily cost of your room but when the Resort Fee is MORE THAN the actual room rate you gotta be kidding me!"
1,When I get a chance to eat here the food is always great. The egg drop soup is very good. The general Tao chicken is awesome too. The sauce they use is great and chicken has nice crust on it.
1,We loved the food. It was spicy but not hot. They can adjust the heat level up to 4 or 5. The service was great!  The food came out quickly and  hot. If we lived here we would go often.  Dinner for two was $38.00 with tax.
0,"I'm a little disappointed in the atmosphere in this bar. It's not at all what I read in the reviews, at least not last night. The music was weird and unless you like 40s of PBR, there's not much drink selection."
0,Good is always good and service when eating in is always pretty good as well. Had take out twice recently and both times the service has been horrible.
1,"I went to Mon Ami Gabi last Thursday during a trip to Las Vegas, and I have to say I was blown away, once again!\nThe food and daily specials never cease to amaze me, along with a superb selection of wines, both by the glass and the bottle. And do yourself a favor and try the chocolate mousse!!!!! You will absolutely melt as you are eating this amazing dessert!\nMon Ami Gabi is always on my list any time I go to Vegas, and it will be on my list again when I return in October!"
1,"I have to say I am a total fan of the food and our server Chad was great.  But I thought it was lame that he couldn't wear his eyelet earrings or his hair in a totally retro fohawk but all the women that worked there looked like they were dressed for a sexy night out on the town.  I don't mind that the ladies were all strutting around with all their naughty bits on display but give us lady patrons something to ogle too!  How about putting the guys in fitted shirts and allowing their personalities to shine through adornment and coiffed hair.  \nBut back to the food, for an appetizer I tried the deviled eggs and they were wonderful and big!  No slacking on the portion size.  We were a large group so I got to sample the burger, grilled cheese sandwich with roasted tomato bisque, the french dip and beef stroganoff.  Every single one was heavenly and delicious!  I also like the plating of the food.  I will be back."
1,"I am definitely impressed!!! I mean this is Mesa, conservative, boring Mesa. Don't get me wrong it is not Scottsdale, Tempe, Phoenix or maybe even Chandler, but Mesa is starting to get it. I am amazed by the Arts Center it is bigger than the little house they used to house all of these activities in. There outdoor concerts on Friday I have been to a few times and am impressed by the difference in people, just a good variety and every seems to be having a good time. Keep growing Mesa, a couple more little hot spot down and around the area wouldn't hurt."
1,"Last week my hairdresser really did a job on my hair. I had 4 or 5 different colors in my hair and he chopped it really bad. So I thought I would take a chance and make an appointment with Jennifer, to my amazement she worked magic on my hair. She  re colored my hair and did an amazing hair cut. She was an absolute doll very nice, funny and very professional. I finally found someone who knows how to ask you what you would like done and she does it even better. I would recommend her absolutely. Thanks. Sheri z"
1,"Best Wells Fargo I've been in and by far the most helpful bankers out of the valley WF's I've been in.  \n\nPaulette has gone above and beyond to help me with my personal accounts and setup another LLC for me and later on a DBA and fix those typical WF surprise fees that I'm not supposed to get but always seem to pop up.\n\nOther that that, it's a typical bank but located in a good place and quick and easy to get in and out.  \n\nThanks Paulette"
1,"I used Yelp reviews to find Affordable Flooring, and I would be remiss to not add to the amazing reviews that they already have.  They are amazing!  From our first experience in the showroom, which was informative and friendly; they had a very nice selection of tile.  We were allowed to take several tiles with us to see how they fit in with our furnishing and lighting in the house.  About a week later we selected our tile and it was a very hard decision.  I had several friends come and give me their opinion. Once decided, we were torn on how much of the first floor to tile.  They were so accommodating to work up several bids with absolutely no pressure.  We decided on doing everything but the bedrooms, about 1900 sq. feet.  We paid a deposit, the flooring was ordered, and the installation scheduled.  When the flooring was delivered, it was the wrong tile.  Long story short was that the sample we had was mislabeled by the wholesaler; we were disappointed to learn that the tile we liked was backordered.  This is where, as one reviewer said, Affordable Flooring is no joke.  They allowed me to choose another tile at the same price, the loss to be absorbed by the wholesaler.  Customer seindyddrvice is something they do not sidestep on.  We chose a beautiful wood plank tile, and we could not be happier.  Everyone that comes in our home comments on it!  The installers lay the tile carefully, and they are artists.  They inspected and pulled tiles that weren't squared perfectly.  The job took a while, and they were polite and congenial.  They also had to work around a master bath renovation, and they were very willing to come out and do the bathroom a week later than the rest of the floor with no additional cost.  I love this company!"
1,"I still call this place \""Sylvia's\"" from its original name \""Sylvia's La Canasta.\""\n\nFood here is legit. And they have a fully stacked salsa and chip bar to hold you over until your food is ready. The seating area is comfortable and ample, stretching out into the shaded patio looking onto seventh ave. \n\nThe area is nothing to worry about. There are a couple of pockets near there that aren't the best but I wouldn't let it affect my decision to go there or not. . .\n\nWhen this place opened, it was a small corner store with a few regulars and a growing number of true believers. After a few years, its popularity began to soar so they expanded the restaurant and grew the seating areas. \n\nWhat can I say? I'm a softie for bootstraps success stories like this one. \n\nFood is delicious, authentic and cheap. I highly recommend swinging by for a daily lunch special, but the service and food are worth the trip around the clock."
1,"Viet-Thai is a pretty nice laid back kind of place.  I love going there and eating the pho.  When it's cold out, this restaurant is the place to be to warm you up.  All the goosebumps go away once I start slurpin stuff...PHO'sho!  \n\nMy husband also got me addicted to their appetizer.  I don't know the name, but it has shrip with crispy noodles wrapped around it.  Delish!"
0,"What's wrong with those f**** doctors.... bunch of primadonnas... they just can't take a call for one question. They simply ask you to take an appointment... oh! sure doc, let me pay $15 copay and have you bill my insurance for one visit so I can ask you if I can stop taking the pills you prescribed and that are giving me constant headaches.... won't even mention her name. They don't care... except about money..."
1,"have not been in a while, is the restaurant closed?"
1,"Very good coffee, excellent customer service, cool atmo, reasonable pricing! Today was our first visit...and will be our first of many!"

0,Closed as per the handwritten sign in the window
1,"This place is small, the store and parking lot are both crowded, and the selection of regular grocery items is limited and overpriced. So why the four stars? Because you go to Mariana's for specific items: 1) the fresh produce, which can be sketchy but has great sale prices, and god bless 'em, you can use their sale flyers at Walmart if you are so inclined, 2) the meat dept., which actually has meat cutters employed, and while they do have some pre-packaged stuff in the deli case for convenience, I love picking out what I want and having it weighed and wrapped on the spot (just like the good old days), not to mention they have Mexican Specialty meats like ranchera preparada which I guess you could make at home, but why? 3) their chips and tortillas, which are superior to any commercial brands, and 4) their little restaurant inside, at which one can (and frequently does) purchase the Paisano meal to go. For $18, you get huge fresh chunks of carnitas, LARGE sized sides of rice and beans, a bag of the aforementioned tortillas, and a large tub of the fresh salsa of your choosing. Feeds a family of four with leftovers, cheaper than fast food and so much better!  If you happen to stop at the little stand in the middle and get an ear of corn slathered in cheese and mayo ($1.50) to sustain you for the 5 steps to the checkout, who could blame you? They also have an in-store bakery, which is quite colorful but I'm not adding any stars because they seem to specialize in Tres Leches cakes, and I am NOT a fan. Who wants wet cake? Eeeww!"
0,"These animals are either going to die or depression or rebel and eat everyone.  I am surprised PETA has not visited this place and staged a mass protest.  Walking around is incredibly sad the animals either look like they are on thorzeine, or stare you down.  \n\nI do have to say, having lived in vegas for a few years, this place makes the must see list simply because it is such an epic fail."
1,Come here if you are ready to par-Tay!!! Music is too loud.
1,"Pretty good BBQ!  I found this place on Yelp when I filtered by rating in the area. Both my friend and I had never been so we drove over (you can smell it before you see it) and parked no problem.  They have a parking lot all to themselves, partly covered.  We went during the lunch rush but were still sat immediately?  I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side spinach salad and some cole slaw all for $8!!! My friend had the BBQ Cuban, it was delicious. They have sauces on the table too if you choose to add some extra nom nom to your meal. The service was okay, my server was very busy so we didn't hold that against her. It was kind of hard to hear her though, she was soft spoken.\n\nI like the outside seating area.  \nThe bathroom was clean.  \n\nI think it's one of those places where the waitresses have to wear skimpy outfits."
1,"Ok, anyone that knows much about me knows I get a little fired up about zoos and the animals being in small enclosures, etc.  However, I'm also realistic.  I realize that sometimes the best isn't always ideal (I also know that a lot of zoos don't even provide their best).\n\nThat being said, I actually liked this zoo for what it was.  It's a free admission zoo so I didn't expect much from the start.  I expected animals being caged like circus animals or chain link fences and dried up exhibits.  \n\nNot the case!  Yeah, it's small. But they've packed in a lot of small enhancements that go a long way! It's perfect for kids as their indoor facilities (rainforest, reptiles, etc.) are complete with educational activities, etc.  \n\nThe size of the zoo itself is a little small, but it was perfect for us. With a three year old, we really don't want to spend all day long out in the heat going through a zoo.\n\nIt's well kept, and while some of the exhibits ARE a bit small for some of the particular animals, they are kept clean and are set up in a way that would be more comfortable for each animal.\n\nFor the \""human\"" enhancement, you might expect to have to pay hefty fees to make up for the no admission.  Again, NOT the case!  Concessions are well below what I expected and the activities that do require payment (train ride, carousel, etc.) are minimal fees at best.  The gift shop is about what you'd expect at any zoo; t-shirts, hats, stuffed animals, books, etc. and everything is priced reasonably.\n\nI'm not sure how they keep their doors open, but if I ever make it up to Madison again, it'll definitely be on our list of things to do... again!"
1,"My favourite movie theatre of all time. It is clean, neat, and the settings are very comfortable.\n\nIt is very close to M\u00e9tro Atwater, so the transportation is very convenient. Also the boutiques and stores within the complex can keep you busy while waiting for the movie."
0,"With this being my first and likely last visit here, it struck me as a poor attempt to compete with Rio's Carnival buffet across the street. Even as a card holder, I paid over $20pp for the Tuesday Dinner.  In comparison to other buffets on or near the LV Strip, it was 1/3 less of the selection and quality you'd find for the price. The flavors were also very bland. The service was not so prompt either. It was the dinner rush, and only a single available cashier who also bypassed a few VIPs.  The ongoing experience actually caused me to lose my appetite as the meal continued. I don't plan on reliving this one. The only positive aspect was their crab legs."
1,"If I ever have a child, I want to name him Jean Philippe, but he will probably get beat up at school having a name like that.  The desserts here are absolutely decadent.  Not only do they taste good, but they are miniature works of art in themselves.  Pastry on the highest level is never overly sweet, and these are no exception.  The quality of ingredients is highly apparent the moment you take a bite into them.  Unfortunately our caloric allowances only gave room for my wife and I to order one apiece.\n\nThe strawberry shortcake was wonderful.  A very nice fruity strawberry flavor uncut by any of the red corn syrupy stuff you see in other places.  I had the vanilla eclair which was filled with vanilla pastry cream.  I think that they use Tahitian vanilla because it had a nice floral vanilla essence to it.  It was a full-bodied vanilla taste often not found in other places.  I did feel a little chalkiness to the texture which is from the starch they use to thicken it.  But, unless you make pastry cream on an ongoing basis, you may not notice it.\n\nDesserts here are not cheap.  At $7 a pop, they can cause sticker shock.  But are they sooo worth it.  Jean Philippe clearly demonstrates why he has received the award as Pastry Chef of the Year multiple times.  I don't think there are any bad pastries as I had some other ones when they were located in the Bellagio hotel.  The pumpkin cheesecake is also a seasonal favorite.\n\nDo not pass up the opportunity to get a bite here."
1,"When I first walked in I felt like I was transported to some future fast food restaurant.   Where quality ruled & quantity is based on the customers desire.\n\nI ordered 2 different sliders to see if they were good overall.   Mmmm, sure was.  The BBQ pulled pork was tender & very tasty w/ caramelized jalapenos.  Other was their Pep pep, a Bacon cheese Burger w/ the fixings!  When I finished these 2, I was extremely satisfied & realized I didn't need the fries I had ordered. \n\nOverall was a great first experience.   Thank you guys..."
1,"I am going to have to go back to Andreoli because the one problem that kept it from being five stars may have been a fluke, and because there are other menu items I really want to try.\n\nAndreoli is mainly a restaurant with an Italian deli and a few dry goods.  It is small and informal but comfortable and clean.  You order at the counter, but the food is brought to your table.\n\nWe had two of the sandwiches -- Italian sausage and an eggplant-based vegetarian option.  The homemade bread was top-notch, crispy and tasty, and for me bread makes the sandwich.  The vegetarian sandwich was delicious in all respects, a kind of eggplant parmesan on a roll.  The onions and peppers on the sausage sandwich almost but not quite saved the day, because the sausage (in the form of a patty the size of a large thin hamburger) was over-charred and bitter.  \n\nThere was one more flaw -- the salad served with the sandwiches had been doused in Italian dressing so heavily that it was nearly inediable.  Perhaps you can get the dressing on the side.\n\nThey also have pasta and other entrees and a case full of homemade Italian desserts, at least three of which have my name on them.  Almost every other diner was ordering desserts, which you rarely see in a restaurant, but we were so full from our sandwiches that we didn't try them -- until next time."
1,"This is a Michelin rated (1-star) restaurant and comes with the bells and whistles you'd expect. My wife had the blue cheese crusted filet, which was tender and tasty. I had the 18-oz bone-in ribeye. It was the best ribeye I've had in a long time. It was not as thick and lean as Ruth's Chris and not as thin and fatty as Smith & Wollensky or Donovan's. Most amazingly, it was almost as tender as my wife's filet. This is not a steak house per say, but this steak rocked."
1,"Great food and selection of Arizona microbrews. If you like microbrews this is a great place to go.  They do not serve any mainstream beers so if you are looking for a bud light this is not the place to go, its a place for true beer lovers.\n\nThe food was fantastic. I had the meat and potato pizza which I was hesitant of at first but the waiter recommended it and I loved it.  My friend had the burger, it was very simple but the burger was juicy and delicious.\n\nDrinks can be a bit slow when the bar is packed but that is expected with a brand new place and I'm sure this will be fixed as everyone gets adjusted."
0,"We have been using this Metro since it opened and have seen a steady decline in food quality.  Today the dough was chewy, the sauce was thin with the result of a water drenched middle ; the peppers were uncooked and the spices were non existent.  VERY DISAPPOINTING on a day when we were watching the nfl playoffs.\n\nWe complained by phone to the manager who was only interested in us coming in to get our refund which defeats the purpose of home delivery. \n\nNEVER AGAIN!  They've lost us."
1,"Wow!  What a happy hour!  The food here is incredible and during happy hour all the small plates are only $5 each!  This gave us an opportunity, over a few visits, to try almost everything on the small plate menu.  The first time we were there, we ordered the bacon-wrapped shrimp, the steak skewers and the brie mushroom toast.  For two people this was a meal in itself!  We were full by the end.  \n\nThe bacon wrapped scallops, the tenderloin toast and the oysters were ordered on the next trip.  Thinking this couldn't nearly be enough food, we ordered the chicken tacos too.  The oysters Rokerij were incredible!  I'm not a big fan of oysters - in fact, can't eat them unless they are covered with lots of gooey stuff.  These were a step above Rockefeller!  The bacon-wrapped scallops and the shrimp both are served with three different sauces on the plate.  It would be best if you tried all three.  My favorite is the spicy red sauce.  They are all very good and everything tastes better with bacon!  The chicken tacos were not my favorite.  There was a funky taste to them that I can't pinpoint.  I'm not against trying them again...\n\nThe bartenders are great!  Can't beat the service here (at least in the downstairs bar).\n\nHappy Hour is only from 3pm to 6pm, which makes it hard to get there after working until 5pm, and prices are only good if you are sitting at one of the bars (there is one upstairs and one downstairs).  The bartenders upstairs are attentive and for the most part friendly but not nearly as good as the bartenders downstairs.  They make you feel at home and will do everything to try to accommodate you and your party.  The new Richardson's is opening soon next door and we are looking forward to trying that.  But our heart is with Rokerij."
0,Shouldn't even get 1 star. My husband and I went here looking for a dresserto match bedroom furniture we have. We found something we wanted to purchase and waited almost 30 minutes for a sales person to help us then were told they would call us the next day with the pick up date and time. No call the next day or 3 days following. We called and all calls go to voicemail no-one returned our messages. We called every store in the valley and no-one returned our call. Horrible service I DO NOT recommend.
1,"As it turns out, not everyone fancies hanging out at casinos, absorbing cigarette smoke, and living the #striplife whilst visiting Las Vegas. Nope, I'll gladly take a quietly sophisticated hotel (quiet, too) with clean air, oversized rooms, and easy access to the Strip when I want it. Enter The Signature at the MGM Grand!\n\nAs the name implies, the Signature is indeed connected to the mothership property, the MGM Grand. My friends had luckily procured reservations for our party of 10 at the legendary 3-star Michelin restaurant Jo\u00ebl Robuchon - located in the mansion at the MGM Grand - so connecting via walkway was ideal and quite easy. \n\nMy room was huge with about 900 unnecessary but impressive square feet to sprawl out in, for a very competitive rate. It boasted a full kitchen, an enormous soaking tub, not one but TWO full bathrooms, a spacious living room, several closets and plenty of outlets for my family of devices. No skimping on space here; this is lavish relaxation!\n\nI did order room service once and wasn't keen on my dish, but hey - you're better off strolling over to the MGM Grand for a wonderful meal at one of their many restaurants. Anyway, you're in Vegas, baby! Make it count. \n\nI'd definitely stay here again if I find myself in Vegas anytime soon."
1,"My \""go to\"" place for Sushi.  Great rolls, busy yet fun atmosophere, and you can't beat the M-Thursday specials.  I agree with some of the other reviews about the waitstaff.  Some are a little forgetful but they are always polite and friendly.  Give it a try, you wont be disappointed."
0,"Very poor customer service by the front desk manager Jaelee Carlton. If you ever receive any good service that mean you are lucky, or she is not the person in charge at that time.  She even call the security , because she can't handle my complaint , beware of her, she don't even care what I need, she don't want to listen , thank Jaelee  Carlton for ruining my birthday , the room did not clean after I told the room attendant 2 times around 12:00 pm and one time call the housekeeping department around 5:35 pm finally the fourth time I call around 12:00 am , the room attendant finally came to clean the room, but I don't think the Jaelee Carlton she care , I ask where can I go while the lady clean my room ? She said she don't know . She don't sincere to think from my position, why did she care ? She will still get the same pay do what she is doing , she don't even want put extra effort to provide good customer service . I ask her what do you want me to say ? She said she don't know , she said I am the one ask her out from the office and want to speak to her.  From my experience I would like her to apologize to me first , when she first see me after she heard my situation from the front desk clerk , maybe this is just my person opinion , that's why I would like to post this experience on this website to get others opinion on this"
1,"There is a very good reason why this nationally known, family run business is the top-rated restaurant in the area, GREAT, FRESH FOOD and TREMENDOUS SERVICE!  Nothing here is canned or stale.  I am a basic enchilada and chicken quesadilla guy, but Roberto's are AMAZING.  If you are feeding several mouths and want to get the best food for your money, this is the place to go.  They make their own Salsa, which you can buy by the bottle, and it is authentic like you get in Mexico, as opposed to the Americanized \""sludge salsas\"".  My wife loves the carnitas and you will not find a better tasting taco.  Anthem is not known as having many great restaurants, but this one stands out. If you are not from the Anthem area, this place is definitely worth the drive:!"
1,"Fat Choy is such a neat little oddity in the Eureka Casino. I ate there with two friends and we shared everything. The only miss were the dumplings. Anything with duck in it was grand. The Fat Choy Burger was delightful. As far as adult beverages, FC only serves beer, but there is a full bar right outside the restaurant, and our server had no problem with us bringing in beverages from there. Which makes you think it would be quite easy to be a little sneaky and BYOB. Overall, FC is great, cheap option in a head-scratching location."
0,Found three hairs in two different dishes! Bun was waaaay too sweet too! Will never go back.
1,"Thoroughly enjoyed our brunch here.  Service was impeccable.  We were promptly seated and served right away.  The white chocolate and orange french toast was wonderful!  It's texture is more of a cinnamon bun than a classic french toast, which I loved.  The flavors meld together very well.  We also had the tableau breakfast.  The pastry basket was delicious and did not need any of the yummy jams or butters. Chicken sausage was also delicious.  Too bad we were so full from all the food or else we would have gotten the souffle.  \n\nWill definitely come back for brunch here the next time I'm in town.  Am dropping my old favorite (Bouchon) off of the list because service and food has really declined over there."
1,"Absolutely wonderful!!! I planned my boyfriend's surprise 30th in Vegas with about 10 of our closest friends! The staff at Las vegas Custom Cakes were incredible. They talked me through all of the steps and completely eased the anxiety of ordering/booking a trip from Boston to Vegas. The cake was a huge hit and exactly how I pictured! And it wasn't just beautiful to look at, the taste was delicious. I'd recommend Las Vegas Custom Cakes to anyone!"
0,"The Brillobox is generally a good place to go if you want to see a live Pittsburgh band or if you want to go to a drag show. It is very smelly on the second floor and it is by far one of the dirtier bars/restaraunts that I've been to in the city. Sometimes when you walk into even the first floor of the bar you can smell a strong scent of body odor and rankness. Some of the bartenders are very nice and a few of them are extremely rude. The food is mediocre at best and it honestly isn't worth spending your money on. The bar's decor is interesting as there is a lot of local Pittsburgh artwork hung on the walls. The crowd that generally populates this bar is lowbrow hipsters, artists, and musician types. You can count on about half of the people in the bar being gay on any given day. This is nice if you have a gay friend because there is an even chance of both of you meeting someone. The prices (for drinks) are about average. Not super cheap but not overly expensive. Their selection for beers and drinks is decent but not awesome."
0,"My friend and I decided to try out TGI Fridays for a beer during the baseball game to get a bigger bang for our buck. For what we would pay for a small hot dog and 20 oz beer, we could get a great meal, larger beers, and great service, right?! Wrong. \n\nThe restaurant was not very crowded for a game night, yet we were denied a table overlooking the stadium. Twice. The manager asked us to visit the hostess stand to get a table, but they informed us there was a wait. NO ONE WAS IN LINE FOR THE RESTAURANT! \n\nI had to get our own menus from the bar, after playing \""let's avoid making eye contact, and maybe she will go away.\"" After we ordered, three sets of people were sat in the tables we were waiting for, and their meals came out before our order! \n\nOur waiter ended up offering us a free beer for the late arrival of our food, and ended up comping our entire check, but that will be my last visit \""Front Row.\"" \n\nI'd rather pay $10 for a beer and $8 for a processed hot dog than to get snobbed by anyone in the service industry. All I wanted was a good time after a work day from hell, and to enjoy a Diamondbacks game ..."
0,Big dance floor.\n\nHave to buy bottle service for no reason... this place is filled with dudes... they got Armenians outside trying to hustle you to buy a bottle but yet there are only dudes inside... how terrible  =/
1,"Don't want to sound like a typical LA snob, but after coming here, I've concluded these may be the best arepas in the area, but they're not the best I've ever had. \n\nI ordered a guava and cheese pastelito, pork butt arepa, and mango juice, which ended up being just the right amount of food. \n\nUnfortunately I had pastelito's mixed up with the Cuban refugiados, which are flaky, delicious pieces of puffy pastry heaven. Although these were freshly made, I would take a refugiado from Porto's in Burbank over these any day. The pastelito was a small, dense, sadly unflaky pastry with a piece of solid cream cheese on one side of the pastry, and very sweet guava jam on the other.\n\nAs for the arepa, it was great and I was definitely happy, especially with the delicious green sauces, but the arepa itself just seemed a little one note; I really had to drown it with sauce to make it flavorful. I've had arepas before, at a small shop in Orange County called Mil Jugos, and those had much richer, more complex flavors. \n\nHowever, these are pretty delicious and the price is right. I'm definitely going to come here again and try the other flavors of arepas, as well as the empanadas."
1,"ate there recently for dinner, it was wonderful. i ordered the goat curry and was excited to try goat for the first time right after i found out it is the most consumed meat on earth outside of the US BUT the table of 12 Indian gentleman behind us had ordered it all....which led me to believe these guys know what they are doing. instead i tried the lamb and it was perfect. i really liked the candor of our waiter \""andrew\"", which was not his name but he called himself that with a grinning smirk; i told him i had ordered kingfisher lagers before and would love to try another beer since they had a few indian beers, he told me to stay with the kingfisher. also, once he told me the goat curry wasn't available i ordered tandoori lamb, he assured me it was good but encouraged me to try the curried lamb since i originally ordered goat curry. my ladyfriend ordered a veggie dish and loved it, we got some bread as well, she ordered some REASONABLY (which is becoming more rare these days) priced wine. all in all the food was very good and the service was near perfect, i like when a waiter can read what you are looking for, makes reco's on that judgment and nails them. i will be going back to maharani frequently for both the food and smiling faces that provide you perfect service."
0,Of I can give this place a zero I would.  I tried to give this place another shot thought it was just the hair stylist. I took my two sons in with two different  girls and my boys walked out with their hair looking ridiculous. I'm so disappointed with this place and when I called back they they said they were busy to fix it that day.  Never again.  This time I mean it.  I have already warned all my family and friends.
1,"I only stopped in to get a night cap (dessert), so I may not be the best to write a review. However, I am docking a star because there was only one bar tender working, so it took him forever to address me, run my card, etc - and this was just for a slice of pecan pie. \n\nWith that said, the restaurant was nice - good location and great ambience. My pecan pie was delicious as well - it came with an ice cream that tasted of bourbon. Very nice pairing. \n\nI got there as happy hour was finishing up, but it seemed like it was the place to be for local finance execs."
1,"I love the location, and it has a drive thru. It's convenient when you're in a rush or don't feel like getting off. Every one is so friendly. Service is always quick. If you happen to walk in they greet you as soon as you open the door. Oh and they have yet to misspell my name."
1,Nice restaurant in the middle of nowhere. Lots of rooms and cozy corners and even real fire place.
0,"My wife didn't want to cook so she asked if we could go back to Old Chicago again. We went there for an early dinner. This time we brought our grandson with us.\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I write this review. I know that this place has a well established reputation. I wanted to eat there again and be happy to write a raving review. And honestly, had they delivered even OK food, I would have done just that. My wife & grandson enjoyed their meals but I am the one writing the review and I was not satisfied. Let me just say right upfront I'm not really a chain restaurant kind of guy\n\nOur server \""Sam\"" was fine but nothing real personable or engaging. Although she was attentive when it came to drink refills. \n\nMy wife got the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo my grandson got the Italian Sausage Stromboli and I got the Classic Meat Lasagna. My wife got the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo my grandson got the Italian Sausage Stromboli and I got the Classic Meat Lasagna. \n\nWhen our dinner did come we realized we didn't get silverware and had to ask for it. My wife enjoyed her Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo. My grandson also liked his dish a lot. Me on the other hand I did not like the Classic Meat Lasagna. Maybe if it was the marinara sauce?  Maybe it's just me and italian food, but it's so hard to find a good italian. Tonight I was very dissapointed. In fact I only ate a little of it and left the rest. When asked if I wanted a box I said \""no thanks\"" As I stated in another review of mine \""I'm not the kind of person to send my food back or complain\"" but you would think when a server can clearly see hardly any of the dish was eaten she would ask if it was OK. But she didn't. For some reason never asked how my dinner was..\n\nAll three of us got the cheese cake for dessert. We all enjoyed it. Like I said before \""  ALL cheesecake is GOOD\""\n\nFOOD:  I think this is one of those places were some things are ok and some things are great - depending on what you like.  PRICE: good values and filling meals with reasonable prices. SERVICE: Nothing real personable or engaging.  AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like any other Old Chicago  CONCLUSION:  The prices were decent given the quality & quantity of food"
1,"nice, clean.. good size tub in the room. Prices are decent.. especially with promo.. and a good quiet place for my bday on march 25 weekend :)"
1,"All you can eat cupcakes?  Who wouldn't love that?  There were multiple vendors here with some standard cake type flavors (e.g., red velvet, lemon raspberry), and some more unusual selections (e.g., prosciutto with fig jelly, pancake with bacon crumbles, smores).  We had a good time going to each booth and trying some of each cupcake.  They also had some goody bags that included chips, brochures, and popcorn."
0,"Stopped by last evening and sat at the bar for nearly 15 minutes being ignored by the two bartenders.  The guy next to me was served and then the bartender went out to smoke.  He watched me as i walked the length of the bar to leave.  Called them today thinking they might like some feedback, but never heard from them.  Was I too old?  Wrong shirt?  Many other bars in town seem happy to take my money.  I suggest you take your business elsewhere."
1,"Perfect lazy summer evening ice cream shop.  Love the old fashioned soda jerk counter (as a former junior member of the Nat'l Assoc of Soda Jerks, I'm obviously an expert! :P ) and classic ice cream sodas, although I remain a total sucker for the vanilla malt.\n\nI have no experience with the bait shop, but they appear to have 5-7 worm varieties to choose from, so... there's that!"
0,"I tried the corn chowder soup with lump crab, caesar salad, and the fish of the day with fries. This was my first time here so I didn't know what to expect. I wasn't thrilled about any of the dishes. Soup was OK, nothing I would go out of my way for. The caesar salad was pretty tasteless. I didn't finish my salad because it wasn't good at all. The fries were overcooked and dried out as if they reheated old fries. The fish of the day was cooked nicely but too much seasoning for my taste. I won't be itching anytime soon to return back here. The service was good. The manager checked up on us and the decor is modern and clean. Just wish the food was better."
0,"good food, but horrible customer service experience with the manager left me and my wife completely disgusted with this place.. never going back if it were the last place on earth serving food."
0,"Went in for lunch and ordered a carne asada torta.  For some reason they actually serve it with fries...I'm still trying to figure that one out.  As for the torta, it wasn't bad but the meat tasted more stewed than grilled.\n\nOne thing that's not good at all is the parking...forewarned is forearmed.  \n\nOverall, serviceable Mexican food but nothing special."
0,"Dear Mirage,\n\nIt is with great sadness that I write this.  I have loved you for many years.  I always chose you over the others.  You were special.  From your tropical decor and aromatherapy- to the tiger habitat.  I even had my wedding reception with you.  Well, it's been a few years and I am shocked and disappointed at what you have become.  I could almost say that you are close to sleazy.  \n\nYes, I know that you're trying to stay \""hip\"" with your new art deco rooms with orange accessories that could trigger a migraine.  Sure, it's probably hard to control the odor of cigarettes and beer in the casino. But- somehow you used to do it. The Wynne does it, as does Bellagio, Venetian, Pallazzo and many others.\n\nBut what I really found distasteful was the new Revolutions Club where anyone walking past- on the way to the elevator- was given a show of half naked go-go dancers.  You know I'm not a prude.  There are some women that enjoy going to a strip club with their man and I say \""you go girl\"".  That's their choice.  But I'm not one of those women.  I don't like anything pushed in my face.  And I do mean \""pushed in my face\"".  The dancers are in little arched doorways between the casino and the club.\n\nI know it's Vegas, but I expected a little more class from you Mirage.\n\nGood bye forever."
0,"I Would give NEG stars if possible. I can't understand anyone giving this \""show\"" more then 1 star! it's the worst show I ever seem! LESS entertaining then any show or skit I ever seem in my life! or even compare to elementary school level! I felt like I got robbed! Seriously, and I SWEAR I FELL ASLEEP, after hours of fighting with my eyelids when I'm not actually that tired.. I FELL ASLEEP. ( & i think the show is 2 hours? I didn't look at my clock) but yeah my hubby told me that the Blue Man saw me sleeping too, when they were running around passing the toilet papers...\n\nWORST SHOW EVER IN THE UNIVERSE! DON'T GO! PLEASE!"
0,"Never again... \n\nWhy never again - the service - it is VERY inconsistent.  There seems to be a new person at the register messing up orders every 2 weeks - so  they are constantly training and training badly.  \n\nMy office is down the street and we have given this location so many chances but sadly there always seems to be something wrong.   \n\nexamples:\n\n-  Order wrong\n-  missing items\n- order not entered into the system for take out \n- order call in and food not made when we arrive (40 min later)\n- rotation of new resister help always being trained\n- delivery guy had no change with him, we had no choice but to give him the change (over $6) which sucked because it took over an hour and 1/2 to get the order.\n- owner/manager/cook sees all this and it does not seem to faze him \n- breakfast was horrible / chicken burrito is ok / Tostada is good (but who can mess up a tostada) \n\nWe have gone to this location at least once every 2 weeks since discovering it a year ago...I even gave menus to different areas in my office building.\n\nAs of today, we will go somewhere else.  There are many Mexican food places in close proximity to our office that seem to care about their business and customers.  I will take back the menus and advise my co-workers of the service as I don't want them to be upset with me for recommending the location. \n\nIt's a shame, the food wasn't all that terrible.\n\nGood Luck to La Canasta. I hope things get better."
0,"In the past five years, the Las Vegas Nordstrom has declined tremendously!   The quality of merchandise is shoddy and the customer service leaves a lot to be desired.  I've always enjoyed shopping at the California Nordstrom stores and was \""thrilled\"" when they put one in at The Fashion Show.   Since the opening of the Las Vegas store, it has never been \""as good\"" as those in California, but I still enjoyed shopping there.  Now, I consider them on an equal status with Dillard's . . . .  not a bad place, but certainly NOT a high end shopping experience."
1,I go here frequently and they have excellent service.  I would recommend seeing Jessica Miller.  She is by far the best hairstylist I've ever seen.  I always hate explaining what I want and not turning out right. She's been perfect since day one
1,Best Thai food in Vegas. I had been told archies was the old standard but Thai spice takes that title. Their lunch specials are awesome.  Highly recommend the pepper steak with a level 7 spice. Yes u can request your spice level!
0,"Chubz was an okay experience. My wife and I bought a coupon online which drew us to this establishment. The food was okay, nothing fancy or anything to write home about. The burger was nothing more than you would expect from a place like Cookout but the price was nearly double. The chili was disappointing as it taste like it came from a 99\u00a2 can of Hormel chili you can get at Walmart. For an establishment that puts chili on nearly every plate, you'd expect some type of \""grandma's old recipe\"" type chili. At our latest visit, one of the owners stared talking very loudly over everyone in the restaurant at the cashier who had a problem with a $5 order the cash register. He was yelling out that he didn't believe that the order was paid for that the customers card needed to be swiped again. He then proceeded to leave cooking/preparing food to quickly run into the office to investigate this seemingly small problem. I understand that in this economy, every penny counts for a private small-business owner, but it shouldn't be at the expense of making all of your customers feel awkward overhearing the commotion. In conclusion, if I'm ever in the mood for another burger, I have other cheaper alternatives near by with generally the same quality and taste."
0,"Blech. The Good Egg my dupa! It's more like \""The Bad Egg\""! As someone who loves trying new places for breakfast food, the one and only time I have ever eaten here, I got sick. In fact, both the BF and I didn't feel good the rest of the day after eating omelettes from this crap-hole.\n\nEvery time I drive by this place (which is every single day because I live in the neighborhood) I say out loud, \""Blech. More like the Bad Egg!\"" \n\nI don't know about other locations in the valley...but stay away from the one on 29th/Bell!"
1,"It's all about the fish and chips.\nThe four stars, that is.  Light and crisp and moist...  with malt vinegar on the chips.. Ohhh yeah, it's that good.  The other food I've had has been fine  - a couple salads, burger, sandwhich... good, but no shouting from the rooftops.\nThe beer selection works for me (as long as there is Guiness, I'm happy).  Be sure to check out the chalk board in the bar - sometimes they have a \""get a beer for 1 cent if your last name begins with....\""  One day the magic letter was \""W\"" - no kidding!"
1,"First off kudos for accepting a 9 person reservation on a Sunday!\n\nNext, I will say the service here is very good. Waiters often come by to refill your coffee and water, which is definitely a plus! \n\nThe food is very good as well. I had the bacon eggs Benedict, with perfectly cooked eggs. The side potatoes were good and for once, and this is rare, the side of fruit was actually delicious! Forget that unripe pineapple and derelict cantaloupe.. This is the real deal! Kiwi, honeydew, banana, cantaloupe, two kinds of apple, yum! \n\nMy only gripe is that the eggs could have been ever so slightly warmer, and having made hollandaise myself I would have added a bit more lemon. \n\nThat being said the food, atmosphere and service were very good and this place is definitely an interesting competition to the Cafe Cherrier across the street."
1,I like their orange and sesame chicken so far. Im really picky with food so i think they're doing a great job. The workers always keep the place clean and they are never too busy to refill your water cup. My cup was only halfway through and they go ahead and fill it up again. I really like that because i hate it when my glass is empty and i have to wait 10 minutes for someone to come by so i can ask for some water and they end up taking several more minutes before giving it to me. So thumbs up for the customer service! They are very nice and friendly so i am never uncomfortable ordering my food. i forgot to mention that their house special fried rice is pretty good too! Cheap price for good food. I give you 5 stars  keep up the good work!
0,"I hate bringing down a once 4 star review to one star, but it had to be done. If we ever go back, I'll see if it still stays the same.\n\nI went back a couple of weeks ago with my metal arts friends...and I have to say what a difference it was. Literally night and day.\n\nOur server was surly and pissy...the food was just appallingly bad...Flicka was nowhere to be found. Service was slow and it wasn't even busy. A whole...4 tables including ours?\n\nThe only remotely good thing about that night, though it's still NOT enough to make me give Flicka's 2 stars, is the checks were all split and correctly done.\n\nMaybe the employees decided to take a break since the owner wasn't there? Whatever it was, we won't be going back."

Totally unacceptable!!!  This person couldn't even answer a question civilly.\n  \nSylvia S.

The group I was there with was sitting in the grass area near the back edge by the walkway about center stage. \u00a0Due to discomfort I get in my knees from sitting on the ground I opted to stand behind them at the edge of the curb. \u00a0I watched the entire Charlie Worsham performance in this position.\u00a0\n\nDuring the intermission between Charlie Worsham and Sheryl Crow I was approached by someone that works there and was told that I would have to sit in the grass or move. \u00a0I explained to him about my situation and why I'm unable to sit on the ground for very long periods. \u00a0He told me that the grass area is considered general seating and therefore you must sit when in that area. \u00a0I didn't buy his reason and he said he would go get security. \u00a0\n\nA short time later he returns with their security personnel and they said the same thing that I must sit if I'm going to be in the grass area. \u00a0Then they further stated that I could not stand in the walkway between the grass area and the bleachers behind. \u00a0They said that the walkway must remain clear at all times and no standing in it is allowed. \u00a0At that point I was told by security that I must leave because I didn't comply with their request to sit on the ground.\n\nI left and was headed for the exit and waited a few minutes before walking out of the park. \u00a0By this time Sheryl Crow was coming out on stage and as soon as she did everyone in the grass area was standing up on their feet to watch her performance. \u00a0Also the walkway that they told me that has to remain clear and no standing allowed in it was filled with dozens more people standing in it. \u00a0I returned to the spot I had been standing at previously and watched the concert with hundreds of other people standing in the grass. \u00a0\n\nI looked around for the employee and security guards that confronted me earlier and they were no where to be found. \u00a0Interesting how they come along and make up their own rules to harass someone while there was no performance going on at the time but once the main act started I didn't see them making everyone else sit and clearing the walkway.
0,"Not what I was hoping for.  Took the wife for a special birthday weekend.  We usually stay at Ceasar's or Aria but I'd wanted to try Nobu, looking for a something unique.  Gotta say it didn't live up to the hype.  First room we checked into was dark and had a view of the casino air conditioners.  They did move us up 2 floors to a nicer room, but still nothing special.  For the same price ( or less ) I've stayed at the Aria with a strip view suite. Never saw any tea and cookies either!  Bed was very comfortable and the slippers at turndown were a nice touch, but the A/C was so loud we had to turn it off at night to sleep.  Housekeeping staff was very pleasant but after being out of the room all day, we returned around 5 to an unmade room.  After calling the front desk, housekeeping came up to clean the room, but in a luxury hotel this was inexcusable.  And in a town of comps, the indifferent manager offered nothing. Motel 6 is more on top of it!  For the $$$ I think there are much better options"
1,Get a rewards card before you order and you can save $1 on each dish you order! I had seafood noodle soup and shrimp spring rolls. The dip was so yummy. I couldn't get enough of it. The noodle soup was delicious as well. Great dining experience.
1,"Decided to finally was my messy vehicle to I brought it in. I thought the price was a bit high forthe gold service and a hand wax. It around $50. They did do a great job! The back seats came out great, keep in mind I have 2 Rottweilers that are in my car almost daily. I would come back here when needed."
0,"I have had too many negative experiences with the staff in this store.  Today I tried going back after a year, and again the staff is so unhelpful, unknowledgeable and downright rude.  I called to talk with the Manager, and her attitude is just as bad.  Which I guess explains the attitudes of the staff.  There are plenty of other places to shop that actually appreciate and help customers."
0,"I experience better and also better flavored pizza my pizza was cold and they did he did but they didn't do a very good job the young lady behind the counter had a bad attitude like she didn't want to be there I was having a bad day either which way the person behind the counter should always treat every customer like a new page in a book I don't feel the attitude was there not very many places to sit if you just want a quick bite they do have a full seating area but not for something real quick it seems like they have a no smoking in this restaurant which is a great thing but then they just stand around outside by the door and all the smoke rolls back in, Definitely will not be back in less the attitudes change but I would never know because I'm not coming back."
1,"Before my show last night, I had dinner at Rao's, something that had been on my radar for awhile.  I made a reservation for 5 PM so I had lots of time for a leisurely meal before the 7:30 show.\n\nI was greeted promptly and taken to a table on the far side of the bar and down a few steps.  It's the last area before you go to their patio.  I had a view of the pool area and one of Caesars iconic Roman statues in a columned structure.\n\nMy server, Howard, quickly appeared and asked for my drink order.  He brought my iced tea quickly.  Having read about the size of Rao's portion, I was careful to choose wisely.  I went with the baked clams for an appetizer and the ravioli purses for the main course.\n\nI was soon brought a nice bread basket.  Howard asked me if I wanted some balsamic with the olive oil and I declined.  I poured some of the oil onto the plate, salted it a bit, and then dipped some of the olive bread that was part of the basket.\n\nWithin a short time, my baked clams were delivered.  They are littleneck clams that had an oregano bread crumb topping.  I squeezed some lemon on the clams and dug in.  It's been a long time since I got baked clams and they were great!  The lemon mixed with the juices from the clams and I had another dipping \""sauce\"" for my bread.  Very tasty!\n\nThe main course came. Rao's calls them beggar purse ravioli.  The ravioli were stuffed with a mixture of pear and ricotta cheese and they were in a sauce of brown butter seasoned with sage and topped with dried cranberries.  This caught my eye when I was reading the menu because it was such a different dish.  It was excellent, too!  The pear taste with the cheese was very mild and the butter with the dried cranberries was a true winner!  A good dish that's really different.  Also, I had dipping sauce #3--the brown butter with sage was a wonderful place to dip a few cubes of the good bread.\n\nFor dessert, I asked Howard for his advice.  He gave me a listing of the entire dessert menu without having to bring one to me.  Of the things on the menu, he recommended one, the peanut butter tart, something his wife makes--she's one of the pastry chefs at Rao's.  The tart had a graham cracker crust, a layer of chocolate ganache, and it was topped with peanut butter mousse.  It was superb!  I'll have the other dessert he recommended on my next visit.\n\nThe dinner was very very good!  Service was exemplary.  The staff or Howard was always around to refill water, get more iced tea, remove dirty dishes, and simply to do a great job!  I am a big fan of Rao's."
1,"It's nice to know that there's decent Indian food that isn't far out in the boonies like Udipi (which, btw, is worth the trip).  I can't say I thought the restaurant aesthetics were that fantastic.  The acoustics in there are horrible, and it seems kind of dark.  But the service was nice, and the food is great.  Beware the stairs of death when you go to the bathroom.\n\nI haven't seen Chicken Muglai in years (they call it Muglai Korma on the menu) and the version they have is excellent.  We also had the sag paneer and a number of other dishes I can't even remember.  All I can recall is that I got my chicken muglai and it was GOOD.  The rest was good too.  I should also note that the portions are pretty large by Indian restaurant standards.  One dish goes a LONG way.\n\nThe nan is a little eh.  A little overcooked, in my estimation.  The garlic nan had lots of garlic on it but little garlic taste.  So, you get all the downside without any of the upside.  Too bad.\n\nIn any case, I will most definitely be coming back.  I"
1,"What sweet little spot for pho. I would have never noticed this place if I hadn't heard about it from a friend-- it's teeny tiny and tucked away near Fat Sandwich. It's dirt cheap (everything is around $5), and I have no complaints about the food. Since the plague that is winter has hit Chambana, it's been a bit disheartening walking out of my class into pitch blackness at only 5pm. But a hot bowl of pho on a rainy, windy night after a long day can cure all of my ills. \n\nNote: I don't think they have a customer restroom."
0,Went there for a friends birthday. Our waitress didn't understand that we wanted split checks and that everyone was sharing the birthday girls portion. Took like 30 minutes for us to get our tabs. The mussels were delish. Would highly recommend. Lobster Mac n cheese was disappointing. Would not recommend. Very disappointing. We went the for the amazing view but it rained so we had to sit inside and it's very noisy and difficult to converse.  I think had the weather been better this place would be great for after work drinks.
0,Definitely was not blown away by Franktuary. Meatballs were subpar at best and the hot dog were okay. The best part was the fries and the dipping sauces available. I've only been there once but I don't think I would go again. Nothing special at all.
0,"I always regret going to this location, which happens about every 4 months or so. Long lines with staff that don't seem to care, and sometimes chatting with what seems like visiting friends. Evenings definitely seem to be worse. Sometimes there is only one person at the register when there are 8-10 people waiting in line. I always get error messages when using my card at the pumps and I have to go wait inside to pay. It's a busy location, but so is QT and they seem to handle it almost perfectly every time. There are plenty of other places in the area, so I just don't bother with this place anymore, you might want to do the same."
0,"$42 for a whole pie?! Some expensive pizza,.. \n\nMy coworkers and I were informed about a secret pizza joint in the cosmopolitan,. so after work, we went on a search.. for the NEW YORK STYLE PIZZA place joint.\n\nI was expecting a fancy sit down restaurant,. but the location was found in between some wooden doors and down the hall,. a regular TOGO pizza joint.  Felt like I was in a sub way,. but I think thats the atmosphere they were trying to create, with ping pong tables and black/white tiles on the wall. \n\nThe cashier didn't really sell me on the toppings,. and kept saying they were out of toppings,. like onions,. and when I asked to be charged on two seperate credit cards,. they charged it all on one card,.. great how can I report this to accounting?! I mean we are each indivdually on VISA GIFT CARD limits on this work trip!\n\nI def should have ordered by the slice, it would have been a lot cheaper.\n\nThis place is overhyped,. I've had better pizza,.. and if you come,.  order by the slice,. cause it would be so much cheaper,. WE HAD A WHOLE pizza left over,. that we left at the bar!"
0,"I have given this Walmart numerous chances and every visit has been the same or worse.\nRude employees with the worst attitude I have encountered at a Walmart.\nDirty store, with open packages of food on the shelves... Like customers just come in and eat in the isles.\n\nSo, 3 strikes this Walmart is out!"
1,"I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews but to be perfectly honest, the food and drinks were great. We got quite a few different items between all of us: wings, salad, pizza, hamburger, kids grilled cheese, chicken fried steak, chili, and spinach artichoke dip. Everything tasted great and was presented very well. I am very picky about what I eat and is food was excellent. The drinks were good too. I ordered a margarita and the rest of the party ordered beer & cocktails. They came fast and were not lacking. The service was good too despite the place being packed. Our waitress was attentive and our plates were always being cleared. The dining room is a bit small so if you get there during peak hours, sit at the bar or expect a wait. It has really nice ambiance and is great for families. I recommend going here. Try it out!"
1,"Fonestar, hands down the best place to get your phone fixed. I came in the store thinking that they wouldn't be able to fix my iphone5s that has been washed in the laundry. Needless to say my iphone was submerged under water for the whole cycle about 35-40 minutes. Once I found my phone I immediately knew that it was game over for my phone and that there was no way it's ever going to work. I left my phone at Fonestar for a whole day because the technician said the longer they have my phone the better outcome will be. The next day I got a call from Fonestar, thinking it would be bad news but luckily it was good news and that they fixed my phone and that all the memory is intact! When it was time to pay I was sure the price was going to be at least $150 or more but no it was less than $100! Long story short, Fonestar did the impossible, with such a cheap price! Definitely the place I would come back to for phone repairs and recommend to friends and family!!"
1,Go off the beaten Pad Thai path and enter the world of some amazing curry. Fresh and amazing food that's perfectly prepared. I love their squash curry. Affordable and delicious every time.
1,"I have been going to this nail salon for quite awhile and they recently moved to a brand new salon a couple doors down from where they used to be located. The new salon is beautiful, relaxing, and very clean. The staff is always very nice and provide excellent service. I usually get gel manicures and pedicures and they always do a great job. I would definitely recommend this nail salon. It's the best I have found in the area."
0,"Worlds Worst Frijoles. I ordered a small side of rice and beans for my toddler. How can you mess that up? The beans came out looking like soupy sewage mess, plus tasted funky. The rice resembled something from a frozen package. Truly disgusting. My burrito was the same quality. I returned the food, paid for my drink, and left to find some good Mexican! Manager also didn't acknowledge the situation at all. When I approached him he just stared at me and said nothing."
1,I love Postino's! Great food and wine. The only downside is that it is on the smaller side and cannot always accomodate large groups.
1,"Great appetizers and beer selection. Good specials, nice staff."
1,"I actually agree with Deanna on all of her points:\n1. Lunch specials are an EXCELLENT deal, and they really are the cheapest sushi in Champaign Urbana... for dinner the prices are comparable with Kamakura. The atmosphere is cool, busy and bustling (if a TEENY bit cramped, but I don't mind that when I'm eating sushi for some reason...), clean, but lack of alcohol is a downer for me. The last really great thing is that they don't overcharge for appetizer dishes and soups like some other places in town. One star off because of cramped seating, dim lighting and I thought about taking another one off for not selling alcohol... but no, it's not fair!"
1,Definitely love the concept. If they don't have a happy hour they should. And bottle service that's reasonable. Only issue is having a video game you never played playing it while getting your buzz on.
0,"The wait was reasonable and understanding but once we were seated the server took a while to take our orders. The first part of service was OK, but the food took about an hour an half to come out. When it did come out I noticed our food has been microwaved for example the knife on my plate was very hot and my mash potatoes were hard.They also messed up on my girl friends order twice and didn't apologize. Furthermore, I was very unhappy with the service and food. I would recommend maybe another location or another restaurant."
1,Casey Jones is where I go to eat. Their sandwiches are great. Sean is the best. Marcie is a great waitress.
0,so slooooooooooooow.\n\nbut i'll go back because it is a 3 minute walk away and they have a full bar.
1,Misty Silverman [ (702) 927-7386 ] is awesome! Great cuts. Everything was even and healthy without taking off too much. She put in beautiful high and low lights all over they look fantastic! Very reasonably priced also!
1,"We dined here June 11th.  We've been twice before with better than average results but this meal was surprisingly good to us ... the best of our trip that included Andiamo, Joe's, Ruths' Chris and Vic and Anthony's.\n\nI had the tried and true southwest pork tenderloin and it was excellent! Served with a corn tamale sweet potato made perfect.  it just couldn't have been better.  My wife had the Tiger shrimp roasted corn tamale and raved about it.  We shared the roasted corn appetizer which was truly scrumptious. Everything gets an A+!  \n\nI tried the signature agave margarita as we'll and while I enjoyed it, it didn't blow me away.  Give it a B.\n\nOur short visit with hostess was cordial and our service team was excellent throughout.  Timely, with helpful menu insight and very pleasant personality and attitude. A+!"
1,"Pros:\n- Type: not your chain coffee shop, all the coffees I've tried thus far have not been disappointing!\n- Service: nice & patient baristas\n- Presentation: I love the way they present your drinks (when sitting in). For pour over coffees & teas, they provide you a \""mini-pitcher\"" & cup on a cardboard platter. Lattes are presented with your typical leaf designs.\n- Environment: lots of seats near the bar and lots of tables surrounding it (a couple tables are near outlets). It's located within the Market so there are a couple of eateries. WiFi is available. \n- Selection: wide enough to have your typical drinks (pour-over, lattes, cappuccino, etc.) but small enough that you're not overwhelmed.\n\nAvg:\n- Price: $3.75-4 for a latte, over $2 for tea\n\nRecommendations:\n- Latte: caramel latte! Yum! \n- Not in a rush: I recommend sitting down and enjoying the ambiance"
0,"Orient House - once a 5 star restaurant- how now changed management as of early November 2013.\n\nI was extremely sad to see the old staff go. They were so welcoming and gave us special orders like Vegetable Soup even though it wasn't on the menu. Now, with new management, all ties of ordering off the menu foods are gone.\n\nFried rice has changed and so have the chicken they use for sweet and sour chicken. It is much harder and the portions are much smaller.\n\nI do not like the change and may have to start going to The Journey Seafood Buffet to get my Chinese food fix ( even though I am not very fond of them all that much).\n\nfor those who are use to the old Orient House may find that they do not like the new change. I certainly do not. \n\nVery, Very sad what the new management changed to the menu including prices and taken off at least 1/2 of the options that were available under previous management.\n\nI will limit my trips there from now on. Maybe even stop going all together."
1,"Halloween VEGAS REVIEW - part 2\nSignature what? Signature who?\nWHOOOODY WHOOOOOO!!!!!\n\nKeep in mind that I have not been sleeping much in anticipation of this short trip away from the mind numbing dross of everyday life... well, as dross as only a GP can be. After entering the suite there's a shower/bath/sofa/tv/view/stove/microwave/iphone radio speaker/silverware/glassware/small fridge/etc/etc/etc. \nAll the space a person could need and then some. \n\nBut the question blaring in my head is... \ncan you put a price on getting some sleep? \n\nConsidering i'm in vegas, (the definition changes a little bit which can be relatively measured by Vegas blocks. and those are some long ass blocks) it's your a 'breath from death' due to alcohol poisoning induced sleep with a good measure of club sweat and minus 'something that I'm sure i'll come to regret when I remember it' type of feeling... more of a gray out leading to a black out kind of sleep.... \n\nbut I digress....\n\nI am supposed to say 'no'' but lets be honest with ourselves. In vegas, you can have anything for a price. And that price comes to around a kingly ransome of about $120 plus taxes/etc a night. And considering the prices in Vegas.. I practically got the JACUZZI BATH TUB for FREE! Yeah, that's right! \nzzzzZZZZZzzzzzZZZ\n;D"
0,"Super greasy and very rare fajitas. Won't eat them and won't go back... it was chilis to go that i ordered online...  that \""steak\"" that had the texture of a roast is going to get someone sick..."
1,"This is a fabulous shop - I've bought several bottles from them now, and can say that truly these oils are the real deal, not over-processed, over-pressed, too-young oils; these are rich, and full-flavored, whether deliciously accented with butter, shallot, garlic etc. or pure EVO. The balsamics are every bit as good and while the flavors certainly can stand alone they combine in so many delicious ways! Rich and Martha will let you taste anything and have great suggestions on combos and cooking. Healthy, light, delicious, EASY way to add fabulous flavors to so many dishes. If you have never used a flavored balsamic or EVO I promise it will change the way you cook! Check out the honeys, candles, and ceramics while you are there too - great gift ideas! (Try the avocado lemon oil with white fish with just a light drizzle of balsamic over the top just before serving - so quick and easy, no more boring week night dinners, and you look like a pro!)"
0,"The food is pretty much inedible. After dark it turns into a hot, sweaty, ugly, trashy dance fest of scary people...who want to fight...or worse yet...fuck.\n\nTwo stars because it is possible to day drink here and survive. But for the love of god as soon as the sun goes down run. RUN!"
1,Just went to number nine last night with my lady. I man that was some good stuff I left full and still had some food to take hrome. thle estruant had a very modern feel to it. Was not ikr other spots I have been to. The menu was very vast making it hard to choose what to eat. I started with some pickeled wood ear mushrooms being a mushroom lover this salad was a good changes of pace to what is considered the norm. We shared a beef noodel soup witch was also great my son kept slurping up the hand made noodels.Witch you can watch the man make in the window to order along with the shu-mi. witch was as good as if you were in China town. Very good mela on the strip got out under a 100 dollars for three people not bad!
1,"Great prices and exceptional customer service\n\nAfter spending the entire day shoping for furnirure I was exhausted when it was time to shop for a new mattress. \n\nAll I needed was a mattress, and then I would be done, how challenging can purchasing a mattress  be, after all it's just a mattress.  How wrong was I.  Matress shopping might sounds easy but there are lots of options and it is easy to get confused.  At Mattress Firm Jesus cleared all my confusion and  I found  exactly what I was looking for, for half the price I would have paid somehere else and the quality of the mattress was exxeptional.\n\nMattress Firm doesn't have any fancy displays or bedroom set ups.  All Matress Firm has is mattress's.  What I enjoyed most about matress firm; their were no high pressure sales pitches.  Jesus gave me the information about mattress sets and then let me make the decission.  When I made my purchase I notices I was $29.89 short and Jesus took additional money of the purchase price. With great prices and exceptional customer service I'll be back again."
0,"I would give this place negative stars but I'm not given that option. Actually, my preferred rating would be '1 Bulldozer', but that also is not an option, so here we go. 1 very undeserved star.\n\nWe were in town visiting a friend down the street and 4 of us stopped by here for lunch on the way to the Metro. There isn't much in the area, and this placed advertised a proprietary 'Copoli Burger' with some sort of optimism, so we thought we'd give it a try. After all, who can screw up a burger?\n\nThese guys. These guys can screw up a burger, and they can screw it up with painstaking efficiency and utter contempt. I asked about the 'Copoli sauce', which the server said was just a mixture of ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise or something like that. Since I'm a no-mayo kind of guy, I figured it wouldn't be too much to ask for just the standard ketchup/mustard on the burger. To the server it seemed like a standard no-hassle request. Awesome. I couldn't wait for this seemingly giant tasty-looking burger.\n\nWhat I received was a large burger almost spitefully slathered with mayonnaise. For some context here, there was only one other table in the place, and they already had their food., so the margin for error or confusion here is very narrow. The other burger recipient at the table received their standard burger with just a standard amount of mayonnaise. So I flag the server, who was super nice during all of this, and show her the burger. Without even looking at it she said there was no mayo on it, but I didn't even have to lift up the bun to show her this 'mysterious' white ooze coming out of it. She offers to take it back and bring me a new one. This is where things get downright offensive.\n\nThrough the corner of my eye I can see the cook (who I am pretty sure is the owner, and the father of our server) take the burger back to the counter and throw the bun in the garbage. Where is the rest of the burger? I wonder. Surely that would go in the garbage too. Nope! There he is, scraping away the mayonnaise with none other than paper towel. He is clearly oblivious that with a small restaraunt, what he is doing is visible to all the customers. Maybe he does realize it, and just doesn't care. Either way, I am brought what I am expected to believe is a new burger, and again, I didn't even have to take the bun off to ask what all the white stuff was still all over the bacon. He must have missed that with the paper towel. \n\nAt this point I refuse any further burgers and I can tell the server is pretty embarassed. The cook/owner/father at no point during all of this even attempts to make eye contact (we are like 10 feet away) or offers any glimpse of shame or even recognition of how messed up this is. I watch the rest of my friends finish eating their pepperoni pizza, which had been unexpectedly dusted in sesame seeds, and I left hungry.\n\nI'm not one for gentrification, but if someone bulldozed this place and put up a condo, I wouldn't be sad."
1,"Sorry to inform everyone this location is closed. Went there looking for my favorite place to eat in Vegas, only to be floored by the empty room  with a sign stating a different restraunt will be opening soon. Good news is there are still other locations in Vegas that feature the HH, the\n Quad, the Plaza, and the original on Sahara."
0,"I've always enjoyed the macadamia encrusted goat cheese, so a friend and I went to indulge on this delicious appetizer, we get seated on the patio and from that point on get ignored, a waitress passed by three times and did not even give the courtesy to acknowledge our presence, even if it was busy (which it wasn't) a quick greeting would have been suffice. We too are in the industry so it's found to be even more disrespectful. I hope this opens the eyes to the staff about giving better service because we did end up walking out."
1,Great place! Got my laundry done fast.
1,seriously have the best onion rings i was in heaven!!! service was good food was good i all around loved this place most def going back this weekened!!! truly a gem
1,"I love this place. I'm only about a 7 min drive down the road, but I'll pay the extra $2 for delivery so I don't have to leave my cozy, cool apartment and go out in the heat. I've ordered many times since I've moved this way in September 2013. I usually always order sweet and sour chicken. The large size. It always gives me enough for two meals. Two people can eat on one, and for $8 its a great deal. I haven't had any issues at all. My husband enjoys the chow mein and hasn't complained. They are usually pretty fast, but there are times where they aren't, but they are usually here when they say they will be. I've been very happy. I've tried another place similar, called Wongs (near 83rd and peoria area) but their sauce was weird. China Place is the closest to me, and great tasting. I've also called ahead to order and then picked up at the drive thru pickup window. Its been helpful when I have to go out or stop at the safeway there."
1,Very good Thai food. Over price and small portions.
0,"Needed something quick. Disappointed. I got the edamame but it's under done and cold. I built a bowl and it's tasty but my broccoli is also really under done. It's like a bowl of steaming shrimp and rice, yummy pineapple and carrots and the broccoli...all but raw broccoli. In between connections and no time to ask them to make it right. Will hold me over but still a disappointment."
1,I've been 3 times to Castello coffee. It has to be one of my first thoughts when recommending coffee to Italian visitors of ours. The coffee is excellent as is the service and the price is pretty good too!
1,I absolutely love this Preschool (not daycare). I have two boys and my first son has gone to three different Daycare/Preschools. My youngest has been to only one other daycare and by far this is the best at of all of them. \n\nThe amount you pay her is not bad for the education they give your child. You do have to bring lunch but I actually prefer it this way because my son can be picky so I know what I am packing for him  he will eat. \n\nThe teachers and staff are all friendly and pleasant to speak with. They have a great curriculum. My son just turned 4 and writes very good (sometimes better them my oldest) he is learning how to add and is loving. They make it fun for the kids so its easy for them to catch on. \n\nI would definitely recommend coming to visit this preschool.
0,"The place is small but they have a patio that appears to accomodate as many folks outside as the actual dining room.  Menu is above register which is also where the baked goods case is located.  Makes it difficult to come in and view the case while someone is placing their order.  Intersting menu items and decadent looking desserts.  That Napoleon LOOKS impressive.  If I make it back here I WILL be having one of those.  I ordered a scramble with spinach in it -can't recall the name.  It was just okay.  It was more like a fluffy, undercooked omelette.  That could be a HUGE problem if I had been dining here with my spouse but for me, eh, no worries.    The macaroon was interesting but not like a traditional macaroon, much bigger to start.  Have to say it was rather tasty too.  My issue with this place -\nIt took so long to get our food.  For almost $24.00 I could get a full breakfast served and my coffee refilled.  I just don't think you get your money's worth here and the long wait just took it off of my places I bookmark.  For a week day the place was hopping and the parking lot was crazy -and it wasn't even close to the lunch hour."
0,"Is that all?\n\nThat is precisely how I felt when the show was over.\n\nThis is a tribute concert, not a musical. There was barely any acting at all. There were no set changes, no costume changes. There was hardly a plot. It focuses on one night and one night only.  No interesting twists. There was no intermission.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the vocals were superb. Voices and instruments were live and real-time. Impersonations were wonderful. But I am looking for a story. An intriguing one at that. For that, it was really meh. \n\nTry Jersey Boys. Now THAT'S dynamite."
0,"HORRIBLE!  STAY AWAY!!!\n\nLast week I placed an order in person for catering for about $150 and pre-paid in FULL. I went to pick it up and they said it I had not paid.  After some phone calls and negotiating, they admitted it was their mistake and they were NOT friendly about their own error.  Then I get home and there is no dressing for the salad.  It's not like I have salad dressing in the fridge for 20 people!  They said I could come and get it.  I asked if Nick would deliver it, as he was there when I picked up the order.  The girl said, \""That's not gonna happen\""."
0,"DEAR D'acks Oganization,\n\nVery frustrated with our families' experience happening RIGHT NOW at the Chase Field.  \n\nSitting in 206 with food service at the seats only to have yet to see our server (it is top of the 4th inning right now with about 13,000 in attendance).  So at the bottom of the 1st inning we ventured out to get food for the family.  After waiting in line for about 25 minutes we ordered about found out that about 1/3 of our order was not available - THEY WERE OUT IN THE 2nd INNING.  So we ordered what we could and waited another 30 minutes for the food to make its way out.  It did and then we found out they were out of condiments (keep in mind, this was in the club level).  \n\nIn sum, by the time we got back to our seats, our food was cold and we are very unhappy.  This last weekend was supposed to be for fan appreciation and I don't feel very appreciated right now.  \n\nWe love our Diamondbacks but I can't help but feel incredibly disappointed right now.  Our family has been season ticket holders and if this is what is to be expected as a fan experience,  you can count us out."
1,"My favorite fast food!  I can eat it without that gut bomb feeling you get after most drive thru's.  The staff is always friendly, the food hot and spicy!  Plus I love the avocado salsa and the new corn cake is yum!  Never thought I would look forward to eating fast food, but I do!"
1,"We got take out from House of Pizza recently and the first thing I noticed is old d\u00e9cor. It seriously looks like they haven't changed in thing in 20 years. It really did remind of pizza places from back when I was a kid. The other thing I really liked about it was that it was very different form a chain pizza place. \n\nWe ordered the house special pizza and it was great. The crust is a little on the thick side, but not as thick as a pan pizza. It is nice and crispy and there are very generous portions of toppings and cheese. I thought the pizza was priced very reasonably (~$17 for a large). \n\nMy brother in law told me he used to have little league banquets here over 30 years ago. It is great a place can stay in business that long and serve consistently good food. I will def. be back here on a future trip to Charlotte."
0,"What a rip-off!!!\nBought a bottle of Kraken Rum, paid $10 too much. $28.99 for 750ml whereas one can buy it for $18.99 at the Wal-Mart on Eastern Avenue next to the airport.\nLesson learned!"
1,The fountain show is a MUST! Absolutely awesome! Hotel is over the top.
0,"Let me start by saying that I would have given the casino alone a 3 . . . but unfortunately the casino gets rated with a hotel that I won't stay in again.\n\nCASINO...\nVery elegant, in keeping with the theme.  And HUGE.  It's pretty much _too_ big; it's easy to get lost inside regardless of the plentiful signage and any cockiness you may have about a sense of direction.  There's an excellent selection of restaurants throughout, but nearly all on the extremely expensive side.  Also, despite the size of the place, it's somewhat cramped and airless by all the machines, tables, and people crammed inside (and searching for a door...).\n\nHOTEL...\nSlowest.  Check in.  Ever.  The desk had a full complement of staff, but each employee across the board was taking 10-15 minutes per customer.  I wondered if this might just be overkill on customer service, or maybe even slow computers (I was ready to give benefit of the doubt), until my turn at the front of my line when I discovered that no, it was just slow staff.\n\nEach floor of the hotel is beautiful and airy, especially the central area near the elevators from which the spokes of the hallways radiate.  The rooms are . . . okay.  They're rooms.  Simple, but nicely decorated.  The pictures on the walls are nicely framed black & white photos of stars of stage and screen.  (Some are a bit dark and creepy, but most are nice.)  But the feel is _old_.  The fixtures are not ageing well, from chipped, scarred, and stained chairs, to chipped, scarred, and stained bathroom fixtures.  (I was a little concerned about the toilet.)  The beds are beautiful and supremely comfortable, but otherwise I definitely felt let down by the quality -- I just expected much more.  Plus, for a non-smoking floor, there was a constant definite smell of cigarette smoke in my room.\n\nOverall does the job as a hotel, but the old-school Tinseltown elegance has definitely faded.  With all the other options around, I won't stay here again."
0,"It's a mess at McFadden's, and even has the delightful, pungent smell of vomit in some places. \n\nMany friends come here to drink and hang out; we also hang to crowd the overused bathrooms! \n\nBartenders can be forceful and crabby, but they can remember your drink at least. Sometimes they direct you to waitresses, who are hard to find!!! I only saw one the entire night. \n\nThey let guests dance on the bar to the weirdest songs. The crowd is odd; mostly young people, but some old ones, too! \n\nDon't forget the crazy overpriced food!! If you couldn't win prizes fun prizes here, everyone would just pass this place by! \n\nIt's that bar where you reminisce about the college parties you used to have, since mostly college kids spend their days here!"
0,"Crap.  Poop. Turd. Fecal matter. Feces. Stool. Thai Rama.\nAbove are all the synonyms I know for the term \""shit\""."
0,"We went back for a second time just to see a band that we were friends with...same story, different night.  It's amazing to see all of the bad reviews on here and that NOTHING is being done to actually improve the experience.  I see the replies from \""Management\"", but it is just a really poorly run business.  The service was incredibly slow, food is awful, cold and overpriced and drinks are bad.  How can this happen...twice?  I've tried to be a fan of this place (the one in Vegas is OUTSTANDING!) but this one is just missing the mark in every aspect of food service."
1,"Great hotel, good restaurants and a fun pool. Very disappointed that the adult pool has been closed.  It as been a fun tradition since it opened a few years ago."
1,"This man is CRAZY!!!! If you ever come to Vegas, don't miss his show. The Showroom at the Flamingo is small, so even if you're not sitting up front he's real close. George says he's running for President!!!"
0,"Save your money guys. This pace is well kept and clean but... food not so much, way over priced for the poor food quality/quantity. Your better off finding a taco truck near by or heck just goto Denny's, you won't be as disappointed there."
0,"Located in the RIO hotel, the menu said \""homemade corned beef and hash\"".  I went with it with eggs up.  The meal was disappointing because there was really no way to say it was homemade and that it wasn't any better than out of a can.  It appears what they do is take chunks of corned beef and put it into a food processor to make it like hamburger.  They mix in some diced potatoes and then saute.  They don't make it crispy, so it's got a consistency of oatmeal.  The flavor was okay and I can tell it was real brisket ground up, but the presentation and texture was just so far from \""homemade\"" that I had to tell the waitress they need to remove that homemade label on the menu. My previous reviews indicate I should have gone someplace else, but I had no time to drive someplace and I didn't want to do the buffet... I should have done the buffet."
0,"I would give 0 stars if I could. Worst customer service I have ever had. Not even greeted when I came in. No one asked what I needed help with. Took forever for a very small job. Inefficient and unfriendly. Go to Kinkos, yes it's more expensive but you can get in and out fast and the staff isn't RUDE and doesn't mess up your order."
1,"Been coming here for years, Kelly and everyone else here is amazing. Quality men's cut/shave and I'm In & out pretty quickly which is good cause I'm not a fan of sitting in a salon any longer than i need to."
0,Service was awesome. The food on the other hand was a complete joke! Portions were small for how much they charge. I hope this was not the only BBQ representing Charlotte! Again the service was awesome but when I leave still hungry and spend over $10 bucks there is a problem.
0,"Soooooo gym expectations have flourished over the past few years and THIS LA Fitness is waaaay behind.\n\nI have been so MANY LA Fitnesses and it seems like they have either been recently updated or they are from 1991. This one is from 1985. I don't know that that is an actual fact but it just seems like it :)\n\nIt is so hot in Arizona. The last thing you want to do it go work out where it is 90 degrees... but that's exactly what you'll get at this facility. Before you even begin your workout you will be sweating. It is a gym so I guess this is acceptable but there are some nasty smelling people and the moist, stagnant air really isn't helping anything.\n\nI will most likely continue to go to this location just because it is so close to mi casa but I wish I didn't have to  :("
0,"We have been there many times in the past, however last nites experience was certainly not what we expected.   \n\n1.  We waited almost 30 minutes for our pizza order to be taken as the priority was to fill \""take out\"" orders before helping all the customers in line.  We noticed customers leave due to the long delay.\n2.  Forget to make our salad and had to wait while it was requested to be made again.\n3.  Pizza was burnt around the edges (more than normally) and soggy in the middle, even though it is the same pizza we have ordered in the past.\n4.  Noticed at least 2 individuals returning their pizza for the same reasons\n5.  The manager was busy talking with a couple for at least 15 minutes without providing assistance needed to take orders and process pizzas.\n6.  Tables did not seem to be cleared off in a timely manner.\n\nAgain, we have been there at least 6 times prior and never encountered these problems.  It may have been a one off, however the couple sitting next to us indicated they would not return as it was their first experience.\n\nWe will try it once again and should we encounter similar issues, it will be our last."
0,"I just got done writing a letter to Harrah's customer service about how disappointed I was with the general service and appearance at The Paris this past weekend.  I'm hoping they take it to heart as I'd hate to see one of my favorite hotels go the way of The Sands, if you know what I mean.\n\nReally, our dinner here is what put me over the edge.  I went over a couple of the other reviews and noticed a pattern....\""I used to love coming here\"" or  \""this time things were different\"".....I too, noticed an exceptional difference.  I will say that I like the food here, I LOVE the view and I have had excellent service before, so, I know it can be done.  But, beware if you get server \""77\"".  Yep.  Her name tag says, \""77\"".  Trying to be polite, we did ask her for her name, but she seemed pretty annoyed to give it to us.  In fact, she just seemed annoyed.  She left 4 completely lighthearted people who were having a wonderful trip with a bad taste in our mouths.  \n\nGood thing for the Goat Cheese appetizer and mussels.  Only thing worth the taste this time around."
1,Serve me up a nice big bottle of WHISKEY! This place commonly has whiskey on sale for low prices! Huge selections of whiskey - old grand dad - ezra brooks - pendleton - evan williams - etc...\n\nPay cash for the best prices. That way 'lee' doesn't have to report as much to the government.
0,"I was told I *needed* to come here and get dim sum as soon as I got into town. Never one to turn down tasty Chinese foods, my cousin and I met up with two friends for lunch.\n\nOur friend, a regular at this place, put himself in charge of ordering dim sum for all of us. Knowing he knew his stuff and also too lazy to care, we trusted him. He ordered shrimp shu mai, fried taro dumplings, fried pork dumplings, chicken and pork buns, taro shrimp, and stuffed eggplant.\n\nThe fried pork dumplings were much bigger than the ones I'm used to from Prosperity Dumpling back home, but still good. The wrappers were still thin and the filling was legit. I enjoyed the stuffed eggplant, and the shu mai was okay (I am not a huge fan of shrimp shu mai for whatever reason). \n\nDespite that goodness, our meal was a bit disappointing. We asked for chili oil and were told they were out. Needless to say, everyone at the table was upset. Even if they made their own and ran out somehow, they could have hit up any of the 373958 Asian markets on Central (like the one next door!) to get a temporary supply. Later, we learned they did not have any chicken and pork buns, so were given regular pork buns as a substitute. Our taro dumplings, which I usually love, were crispy, but were not cooked through. My friend mused that his was cold. I bit into mine and upon first bite, nearly burnt the roof of my mouth. However, my next bite was lukewarm. \n\nThe prices here were okay and the service was good, but I felt it didn't live up to the hype. I would like to give it another chance, but I'm not going to go out of my way to get back there when there are so many other places to eat in this city."
0,"Well, I have to admit first that I have been here before and had decent service, between 3 and 4 stars...BUT, the time I decide to go, for my girlfriends b-day AND spend the most money here I ever have, turned out to be the worst!  They have a sushi plate, that quotes 13 pieces...13 pieces of sushi, right?  WRONG!  6 pieces of legit sushi, 1 piece of imitation krab, and 6 pieces of a freakin california roll!  Are you kidding me!  Your going to say I get \""13 pieces of sushi\"" (verbatime) and six of those are 1 california roll.  Anyways, so we asked them to take it back, and order something with more sushi, and more expensive.  Unfortunately, our snooty waitress didnt appreciate that nor have any interest in our reasoninig.  So the rest of the evening we had a krap experience from our server.\n\nWhatever, I have been there about 7 times now, they have a cool bartender there (light skinned guy with braids), decent happy hour and so-so sushi for arizona's sakes.  This is better the Wasabi sushi atleast...but if your not set on Sushi, try Gordon Biersch, The Keg or the mexican place in that mall for happy hour first."
0,"This place was about as bad as an airport bar and restaurant can get.  When I first walked up and asked if they had power outlets to charge my phone while I got a beer and burger, the bar tender rolled her eyes and acted like I was asking an unreasonable question.  Do to the limited choices, I stayed anyways, but should have ran.  They are not a brewing company, just a bar with basic beers.  The worst part of the entire experience was the burger.  Completely disgusting!  Do not order a burger.  It was a frozen meat concoction that tasted more like fillers than beef.  My came out pink all the way through and bar tender said that is how they cook them.  I took two bites and could not finish it.  Horrible experience and still a dead phone....errrr....what a waste of time and money."
1,"Was looking for a special dinner...something that would truely be memorable.\n\nFound Sage and decided to give it a go!  Atmosphere is very nice...very upscale and modern feel like the rest of Aria, and it worked well for us.\n\nWe tried the tasting menus with wine parings!  It was a first for us, and it truely felt like we were the special guests of the restaurant.  Service was great and attentive.\n\nI won't go into each dish...break it down into a million ways, and explain why it was so good.\n\nEvery dish was great...and I felt the pairings were spot on.  It was a very fun and exciting journey down Sage's tastings, to try each of their \""bests\"" and have fun eating each and every bite.\n\nHighlights :  \n\nWaygu tartare was so good....I still think about it days later.  \n\nThe grilled octopus was easily the best I have ever had...it was so tender, I don't even want to know how they did it....must have beat the hell outta it and marinated it for hours....so so good, you would not even know what you were eating because it was a completely different consistency.\n\nThe foie gras brulee was an experience.  I have never had it before, and the whole dish was an explosion of flavor...almost TOO much flavor.  TIP : Spread it on the bread that they give you with the brulee...you still have the amazing tastes, but it is not nearly as sweet and overbearing.  Once I figured this out, the dish was night and day better.\n\nLamb was great...I had no idea what sweet bread was, and I ate most of it lol.  I was told later, and it still didn't change the fact that everything was great :)\n\n48hr beef belly was crazy packed with flavor...so tender, reminded me of pulled pork  meets pot roast...it really really works.\n\nThe waygu sirloin was the hit of the night.  So tender and packed with flavor...my mouth waters thinking about it.\n\n\n\nOverall, this was a big splurge of pocket change to throw down on dinner...(well over $400 with tax and tip), but it did its job of giving us a very memorable anniversary dinner and a food experience we will never forget.\n\nGo for it!"
0,"I was excited to try this place and it looked really cute when we walked in.  We took our tacos to go and when we got home we were really disappointed.  We both got 3 taco plates... chicken and carne asada.  The chicken was dry and the carne asada was unflavored beef.  Overloaded with vegetables and most flavor was the onion on the taco.  I really hoped it would be great, but it wasn't."
0,"Disappointing for sure. Everyone waaaaaaaaay over-hyped the \""Frozen Hot Chocolate\"". In the weeks leading up to this last Vegas trip, all I heard about was how I had to try the Frozen Hot Chocolate because it was sooooo amazing. But having now tried it, for the price, way not worth it - it's icy and too powder-y tasting. I would much rather have a chocolate frosty from Wendy's, that's much more like frozen hot chocolate, and doesn't cost $10+ dollars.\n\nI would say skip this place. There's other (and probably better) places to try on the Vegas strip."
0,"I had an issue ordering over the phone and the lady having a very poor attitude. \n\nMy Inlaw went to pick up the food and waited forever, the order was my near ready.. And the lady had forgotten most my order. She also had a very rude attitude while dealing with customers.\n\nI wrote the store and still have not got a resolution. Needless to say I have not returned."
0,These people do not know what they are doing and I have to repeat my card number several times before they get it right which makes me mad and them waisting their time. They need to listen because I don't need to repeat my order for 3 times for them to get it. I suggest hiring people who know and understand customer service and how to be properly prepared and staffed well bc if ur always under staffed doesn't that tell u something that u should hire more workers?  Just a suggestion but I hate coming here everything is unorganized and not handled properly
1,"If you are looking for a great breakfast place, this is it. Sweet potato hashbrowns, free wi-fi, and a nice atmosphere--what's not to love?  Yes, it can get busy, but so can I.  Let's not judge. \n\nBe aware that they serve ice in their orange juice."
1,helpful funny and nice staff. always try to get your the best deal weather it's a coupon from the paper or your insurance they want to get your the glasses you want for a good price. doctors are informative during procedure and always keep appointments.
1,"I called 2 companies, The first company came out with a \""pricing on the fly\"" model. They pushed purchasing a new unit and gave me a quote of about 1200 dollars and said they didn't have all the parts and that it may be worse if they find other problems. I paid the 79 dollar diagnostic and called One Hour. The guy showed up on time and had all of the parts. His price was about $400 less and they had all the pricing preprinted and defined. Here is why I gave them 5 stars. The tech accidentally fried my thermostat. We didn't notice till later when we figured out the unit wasn't shutting off. They sent someone out the next day and made it right. That is a critical piece. When something unexpected goes wrong (as it does from time to time), a good company will make it right. These guys made it right."
1,"Great food, good atmosphere, good wine. I'm always so impressed by how they have the place set up. There's a huge atmosphere change from being outside in the parking lot to being in the restaurant."
1,"This was the one restaurant for which we booked reservations ahead of our trip, once we knew we were staying at Mandalay Bay. I was not disappointed, even though I was a little wary that the menu might be a little over-ambitious. Everything from sushi to clam chowder and biscuits. The service was fantastic: our waiter  was new, a little nervous, but so friendly and accomodating. I had the weirdest combination of food I have ever tried: a yellowtail jalapeno roll and BBQ pork mac 'n' cheese! Both very fresh, unique and delicious. The cocktail menu is equally mind boggling, but the gin and tonic variation with the lemon, simple syrup and basil was out of this world. A terrific wine selection as well, and corn bread and biscuits are complimentary. A bonus: the vegetarian at our table discovered some tasty options, not all on the menu."
0,"One word to describe Over Easy: disappointing. \n\nIt would've been an OK breakfast place if it wasn't for all the hype. I've been trying to visit this place since I found out it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, so when I saw the deal on Doozy of a Deal, I purchased it right away. I made my own omelette with chicken, garlic, and spinach. The chicken was overcooked and the omelette and my hash browns were terribly greasy. My cousin ordered The Wolfpack and was also disappointed with her meal. It just didn't seem up to par with a place that was on Food Network.\n\nThe icing on the cake was the Over Easy Ice, their iced coffee. They could've given me a cup of water and cardamom and it wouldn't have tasted any different. We couldn't wait to get to the car to get some gum, to get the taste out of our mouths and even that didn't help. After reading other people's reviews, it looks like they hardly had any caradmom; so looks like Over Easy needs to figure out a way to uniformly make their coffee.\n\nSorry Over Easy, you were quite disappointing."
0,"This is not one of the better simple breakfast cafes in Vegas. Although the decorations inside are cute (huge USA map, etc.), it still has an odd feel to it inside. Not sure what it was - guess I thought that this place should have more people inside - especially considering every other place in Vegas is so packed.  \n\nThe service was friendly, but the food was just lacking. I say skip it and eat your breakfast elsewhere."
0,Once again they are 45 minutes late. This place is ridiculous \n\nThey are also remarkably disorganized \n\nIf you have a choice AVOID DOC!!!!!!!

1,"I've seen this place before in Tempe so I was dying to give it a try....oh no, now I have another fast food guilty pleasure :)   Me and my friend both thought the guac was amazing and couldn't stop eating it.. one of the workers even brought us extra chips free of charge and refilled our drinks (did I mention this is a fast food restaurant?).  I had the carne asada torte and it was sooo good.. I keep dreaming about it.. I'll have to go back sooner then later..like tomorrow."
1,"OMG the cupcakes are awesome! I'm the type of person who usually won't spend money on a cupcake. I just can't  bring myself to do it. I can bake a whole batch of cupcakes for the price of one. But my fiance and I were visiting different bakeries to find a wedding cake, and Retro had such great reviews that we decided to visit. The cupcakes are so good, and we liked so many of them, that we decided to do a cupcake tower instead of a wedding cake so that our guests can choose what flavor(s) they want. :-)  They are a small shop, so you do have to be patient if you're calling ahead or emailing, but the employees are all very friendly. So far, my favorite is the Hop Scotch (and I'm usually a total chocolate person), but several others were a close second. I will update the review after our wedding. :-)"
0,This breakfast spot was recommended but I've visited a couple times to finally come to the conclusion it's really just sub par built for the IHOP faithful. If you're used to fresh and interesting breakfast joints this will disappoint. If you enjoy IHOP and Denny's this is a step up.\nThe menu isn't surprising with a good range of breakfast staples not getting too inventive or wild.\nMy bacon seemed precooked and dry. The omelette was ok but nothing special while my wife had an eggs Benedict to be surprised at the odd taste of the hollandaise sauce( not on a good way!) we were informed by the staff that the sauce is shipped in by bags and is chicken broth based... All I can say is WOW. \nReally had to force the second star on this.
1,I brought my mini daschie in and we tried on Xmas sweaters and walked around the store- picked out a toy and then he even got a treat at the checkout aisle! We really enjoyed ourselves! It was a great treat to take my puppy out!
0,"This was the most disappointing BBQ restaurant I have ever been to! From the time I opened the menu and noticed the up selling on items like the sides, and burger items, calling sides regular sides, fancy sides \""in which you pay more,\"" then fancier sides \"" in which you pay even more.\"" These side were basic sides that usually accompany BBQ dishes, and the mac & cheese tasted like Kraft box mac & cheese. My soup was cold and tasted like they just took it from a package and poured it right into a bowl. I told the waitress about the cold soup so she offers to give me a Caesar salad to go, and they poured the dressing on it to send me off with a soggy salad. The brisket was tuff and awful, and the steak was spongy. The most important flaw was that none of their items tasted smoked. Smokey bones is the McDonald's of BBQ with a bar."
1,"I have read many unfair reviews of this restaurant. It appears many people are attempting to \""double dip\"". If you buy a groupon, don't be a cheapo and expect that the sushi half off will apply to you and then you can also get to apply your groupon. How do you expect these people to live? \nOutside of the misers that are reviewing this restaurant everybody should know the following:\n1) The sushi is amazing. I have seen some really innovative stuff.\n2) The owners are amazing. They are super friendly and, if you have children, they are kind to your children. It is not every day that you find that in a sushi restaurant. \n3) They will accommodate you. If you are a sushi fanatic like myself and like something that is not on the menu, ask and you shall receive.\nAll of these reasons combine to make this my FAVORITE sushi place in Phoenix."
0,"Pizza is very good, havent tried anything else yet, however their service is just as bad as most new yorkers, they charge 50CENTS for refills! bunch of cheapskates! only on the strip you can get away with that!"
1,I took the tour here with some friends and we were blown away with the fun and great spirits to taste. We learned a lot about the history of AZ spirits and culture. I totally recommend this to any group of friends to do.
0,"I do not recommend this school. I was extremely dissatisfied with the school's inflexible policies, the communication rendered by employees, and the effects enrollment there had on my child.\n\n1) Incompetent Care\nThe entire time my three year old attended, she had a rash on her rear, as they did not wipe her properly when she used the bathroom. Three year old's need assistance in getting cleaned up after they go potty - this is daycare 101. As soon as my child would come home, her rash would clear up - then return during the next week at school. I spoke to the employees at the school about this on several occasions and nothing was done to correct the problem.\n\n2) Forced Naps\nTwo hours out of the five my daughter attended Scottsdale Academy daily, the children were required to nap. No provision was made for children who don't nap (mine just happens to be one of those kids who don't). They are not even allowed to quietly read or draw - they are forced to lie there. Failing to provide an option for a quiet activity / assuming all children fit one mold is simply bad childcare.\n\n3) Inflexible Policies\nThis school requires that you pick up your child at a certain time, regardless of what time you drop them off. For every five minutes you are late, they charge you $5.00. They are completely inflexible about this regulation, even for moms who have other kids to pick up across town after school. Because of this rule, I was forced to pick up my little girl at 2 PM before the other after-school pick-ups I needed to make, thus reducing the amount of time she was spending at Scottsdale Academy. They would do nothing to modify their fees to compensate for this, and were completely unwilling to make adjustments based on actual hourly attendance. It's as if they do not want your business!  Interesting business model - I imagine attrition is high at this school. I know I was only too happy to withdraw my child. (By the way, they don't refund any of your money when you withdraw.)\n\n4) Communication Problems\nThe daycare workers at Scottsdale Academy do not communicate with parents about the daily experiences/progress of their children. A slip of paper is provided at the end of the day telling parents that the child napped or did not, ate or did not, and what project was completed. No other information is shared - nothing about social interactions, milestones, problems, or other pertinent issues. When I arrived to pick up my child, everyone there acted as if they were too busy to stop and talk to me."

1,"When you move to a new town, some of the biggest challenges are finding an honest mechanic, a great hair stylist, and a trustworthy pool guy.\n\nI consider myself lucky to have found August at Del Sol, first shot.  After reading horror stories about pool companies in the Phoenix area, I realized that there were plenty of unscrupulous people out there.  Having seen a number of Yelp reviews and after doing some additional web research, I was pretty confident that August was the man for the job when the pool at our new house needed some attention.  August was able to come out the next day and replace the sand in our filter.  He also did some routine maintenance and a minor repair--without any additional charge!\n\nNot only is August honest, but he's highly informative.  Sure, you're paying for a service...but August goes above and beyond by providing you with information about pool maintenance that could save you time and money down the road."
1,"extremely convenient for wynn guests because it's just right across from the hotel. outside looked small but the inside is surprisingly big with all the big dept stores like Saks, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus i think, another that starts with a D and Macys. Kinda like mid range products and you can find anything from fashion to electronics(apple) to convenience store etc."
1,"First impressions here were excellent.  \n\nIf you're not familiar with the concept, a USB is used to keep track of your progress, you choose your \""goals\"", and the program does the rest of the work in formulating your workout.  The screens on the all-in-one weight training equipment and the mp3 players on the ellipticals and treadmills guide you through it.  The smart technology on the machines keeps track of your reps, strength, range of motion, etc.  All you have to do is show up (oh, and DO the workout).  Your information is recorded and you can review your workouts and progress online.  \n\nThe staff (we mostly worked with Lauren) were so great.  They are kind, patient, and encouraging teachers.  No judgment or intimidation here.  Just people who want to help you meet your goals.  The club is staffed 7 days and there is a key fob you can purchase to have access 24/7.\n\nThe club itself is spotless, uncluttered, and nothing like the typical \""gym\"".  No mirrors up, down, and sideways... no people standing around watching themselves lift weights... no rows and rows of machines and fitness equipment to be confused and overwhelmed by.  But it offers everything you need to get a great workout and follow your \""plan\"".  \n\nI signed on for the year in my first session because the lifetime enrollment fee was waived.  It will be $79 a month with a year contract.  After the first year, it rolls into month-to-month.  If, during my 30 day groupon trial, I decide that this plan isn't for me, I can cancel without obligation.  \n\nI'm looking forward to my no-nonsense, virtually guided workouts in this very calm and welcoming environment."
1,"Best NY style pizza you can get in the area.  Whether it's late night, or delivery, you're going to get delicious pizza, crispy but not floppy crust, and a mouthful of gooey cheese that sits well, is flavorful and doesn't drip.  People write a lot about how it's too greasy, etc etc, if that turns you off, then just go to Crust or something!  I think people who enjoy Joe's know what they're getting and are big fans of it.  \n\nGet some!!"
1,"Evolve is amazing! I organized a spa day for a group of six, and the staff was extremely accommodating. Each of us had multiple services done and we all enjoyed them tremendously! My massage with Becky and facial with Audra were blissful.  The spa atmosphere was both welcoming and relaxing, and the prices were very reasonable. We can't wait to go back!"
1,"Whenever my husband and I do shows, we stop here first. They have a great selection of shows as well as restaurants. We have gotten tickets to popular shows for next to nothing. I would definitely recommend stopping in and seeing what they have before heading to the box office."
0,Worst ihop i've ever been to.. The service is rubbish they were very late to bring the food and my friend order they forgot to bring it till 30 minutes later we tried to tell them to bring the order but the server was never there. Btw me and one of my friends ended up with diaria
0,"No esta bueno compared to the Tempe location. Saw a case full of massive, beautiful pain au chocolat. Ordered one to munch on while waiting for our sandwiches. Turned around for a second. Next thing I know I have this sad, orphan looking piece of bread in front of me. What a pain, getit?\n\nWas planning on eating here but no outside seating for the dogs and took 40 minutes to make a sandwich. The lady behind the counter gave me a half snarl when I asked her to wrap the sandwiches up to go because why in the hell did it take 40 minutes to make a sandwich.\n\nYou sold me a bill of goods, Essence Arcadia. You're Tempe's evil twin sister and I won't forget it. \n\nAlso, get it together with the outside seating. We live in ARIZONA. AMEYERIGHT?"
0,"I was a little nervous about shopping here after reading the reviews, but since it was closest to our hotel, we gave it a try.  It was fine. Nothing worse than you'd find in the SF Bay Area. Buck up, little campers. Quit being so stuck up."
0,"I will keep this short & sweet. I have been here twice and here's what I think:\n- Green tea hot chocolate tastes like matcha powder with icy water\n- Carrot cake in carrot cake sundae is delicious. Overall, carrot cake sundae is probably the best thing I've had here, but it is not for the faint of heart. Dessert fiends and sweet tooths like myself will appreciate this dessert. The cake was tasty and moist. Together, 4 people shared it.\n- Salmon benedict is way too salty\n- Frozen hot chocolate is exactly what it sounds like... Frosty icy hot chocolate\n\nOut of all the things I've had, carrot cake sundae is the one to get. Also, the service here is MEH for vegas. A waiter hit me in the head and didn't even turn around to apologize! Also, we told our waiter we didn't like the green tea hot chocolate and he didn't do anything about it!"
1,"A tiny bar that's perfect for the soccer fan.  This bar has dedicated itself to \""football\"" and it's hooligan fans.  The beer selection is very limited but who cares!!"
0,First time coming here and took an hour to get a burger on a weekday and after the first bite I find a long black hair cooked into the burger meat!
1,"I've had some terrible experiences with banks in the past and when I relocated to Las Vegas I wasn't sure which to choose. But I'm really glad I did pick this branch, I have had to do a ton of things through this bank and everyone I have dealt with has gone above and beyond to help me. Rough location to get out of, Rainbow is usually a mess right there."
1,"I miss good, cheap Thai food! I used to travel to LA pretty frequently, and I got spoiled in having a nearby restaurant that was good and cheap.\n\nJasmine Thai is good, but the prices are on the high side. The spicy shrimp coconut soup was tasty, but a similar dish would have been $3-4 cheaper in La. The chicken larb was very good, but it, too was a buck or two more than I thought reasonable. The papaya salad was the best dish; it was at an OK price.\n\nWe ordered the food \""medium spicy\"" -- always a good idea at a new restaurant. It came out with just the right degree of heat: my tongue stinged (strang?), but there was no  alcohol taste that sometimes accompanies overly spiced foods.\n\nMy beloved and I decided that this would be a once-in-awhile addition to our restaurant rotation, only because of the prices. Somehow, the food just doesn't seem to taste as good if you feel that you've been overcharged."
1,"This morning I went to the facility at Central and Dunlap. Corneal abrasion, my 4th but 1st in this eye. In the past I went to the ER.  A corneal scratch is hideously painful, I took liquid morphine last night that I had from another recent injury. Then again this morning.  I couldn't drive far with one eye.  I was hesitant to go with such a serious eye injury but WOW.  From front office to treatment everyone was very caring. Dr. Boyer PA and the medical assistant were great. When I left I was confident that what caused the abrasion was no longer in my eye, I could see from the eye.  II would most certainly return in the future as an option to the ER."
1,"Good work, fair prices, friendly people."
1,"Quite possibly one of the loveliest pools around.  It's actually more of a complex of interconnected pools complete with a beach at one end (kid alert!) and a swim-up bar on the other side.  At night the whole complex is enchanting.\n\nThe staff is quite friendly and the hotel boasts several good bar options for hanging out and soaking up atmosphere.  \n\nDid I say friendly staff?  Hmm, let me just say that my every interaction with a member of this team was accompanied by a genuine smile and/or \""How are you?\"".   Hospitality industry veterans (yep, that's me) are pretty good at spotting the grit-teeth-and-smile-at-the-annoyance look.  I never saw it here.\n\nWhat I truly love about this hotel, however, is the very dramatic lobby with it's many levels and views.  It just screams \""I am at a resort!\"" and I adore it.  \n\nFull disclosure - I have never stayed here as a private guest, only as a member of a business conference (several years in a row), but I would definitely put this place in my top choices of places to stay should I ever come as a private vacationer."
1,"Camelview has been bringing foreign and independent films to the valley long before it was a hip trend.  The theater might be a little run down, but its staffed with true movie lovers happy to be there.  There are 5 screens so you tend to get more stuff running here than the average one screen indie moviehouse.  They show an excellent mix of films you'd have to hunt down otherwise, and the location is very convenient if you want to do something before or after your movie."
1,"In the mood for sushi or oysters but stuck downtown?  This is your place.  The Ahi is excellent!!  Oysters are great.  Service is always great.  Atmosphere is comfortable with numerous TVs and away from the din of the casino.  The best brew I've had here was a mango cream ale: refreshing, well balanced, mango essence and not overly sweet--great brew to have with oysters and spicy Ahi!!"
0,"I went here with a group of friends because we were going to a concert there (Metal Elvis, meh). We weren't expecting much but were seduced by the convenience of eating at the same place as the show.\n\nThe first problem was that one person in our group made a reservation online, but they had no record of it when we got there, despite our having a confirmation number. So, we had to wait for a table.\n\nThe next problem is that the Mint Julep I had was probably 90% simple syrup. Truly an awful cocktail (not to mention that the waitress had no idea what kind of bourbon they had).\n\nThe service was slow. Some manager type came by and gave us some kind of locals only frequent member card. Not enough for everyone, mind you. Which was fine by me because I hate that kind of crap. Don't need another card to carry around.\n\nThe group shared a plate of nachos which were OK. Kind of hard to screw up corn chips and cheese, so kudos to the Hard Rock for that.\n\nThe special that night was a portabello mushroom sandwich, which seemed to be a reasonably healthy alternative to everything else on the menu. But it was so slathered in cheese and this obnoxious mayo concoction that it really was as much a greasy, drippy mess as any burger. Came with a salad but most of the \""vegetables\"" were white, so that was a disappointment, let me tell you.\n\nWent in suspecting that the Hard Rock Cafe is nothing more than a tourist trap and everything about it confirmed this suspicion."
1,"So, according to Martin's brochure, he does everything and anything having to do with your yard.  \n\nCleanups, sprinklers, monthly services, landscape design, etc etc\n\nI called Martin after finding his brochure on my door knob.  That's how I choose my landscaper.\n\nMy yard was like a jungle.  Overgrown grass, weeds, trees, blah! (I've been out of the country a lot the past few months)\n\nMartin and a team of workers came over to my place, and for $100 bucks they took care of EVERYTHING.  And I mean, EVERYTHING!  They even netted my pool clean!  And they emptied a small trash can I forgot about!  \n\nSo after being thoroughly satisfied with the work, I hired Martin to come out on a bi-monthly basis for $70 per month.  \n\nA steal, all things considered, because my yard is big and a painnnnn\n\nHooray!"
0,"Alright, so I am somewhat conflicted writing this review and giving it only two stars, here's why: \n\nI am from the Bay Area, Cali and just moved down here. In SF and Emeryville Trader Vic's is known for being a classy cool spot to go get good food and even better drinks in a funky environment. I have always loved Trader Vics and it has been one of my fav spots in the Bay for a while. Which leads me to the Scottsdale Trader Vic's which is basically at the Valley-Ho. Having just moved to Scottsdale I thought this would be a fun place to take a date, now wishing I would have chosen somewhere else. \n\nThis is a nontraditional Trader Vic's, typically known for their dark lighting and borderline tacky decor, this Trader Vic's looks like it belongs in a shopping mall. Really open and not very much decoration and on a Saturday night you could shot a cannon through the place. I ordered their famous Mai Tai which is usually awesome, but sucked, hardly any booze, wayyy too heavy on the lime. OK scratch the fun drinks, I get a bottle of wine with some disappointment as my dates drink also sucked. \n\nService was OK, not great... couple slip ups here and there, like pouring regular tap water into my glass of 1/2 full of bubbly water that was 8 bucks, then pouring me another one and trying to sneak a 2nd bottle onto my tab, busted. They redeemed themselves quite a bit by taking off one of our entrees (the duck, which was disgusting, dry, and tasteless) from the tab after she had said it was terrible. \n\nThe food in general was disappointing. In SF, Trader Vics has a poignant menu and a variety of different types of beef/seafood/chicken/wok. Not really the case at this one. I don't eat seafood so I was expecting to see my favorite Peppercorn NY Strip on the menu, not there. Basically if you don't eat seafood you have to pick from the duck (which was terrible), the beef tenderloin (what I ordered, was reasonable but wickedly overpriced at like $34) or another grilled chicken dish. The mashed potatoes were cold, the spare rib appetizer looked like it could have been served at Chili's (not a compliment) and in general the whole culinary experience was a disaster... as if that weren't enough then I got my tab... holy shit, i thought cost of living was cheaper down here, guess not at Trader Vics.... \n\nIn general 2 thumbs down for SCOTTSDALE Trader Vic's, although I will maintain patronage to the SF ones as long as they don't head down this path...."
0,"It had been years since I had been back to Rito's, I was craving it for lunch and thought let's do an old school affordable lunch.  I typically eat Burrito's at the Lunch Trucks so I thought Rito's being in the middle of the hood, nothing fancy, outdoor seating and so on should be a quick affordable quick lunch for two of us.  We got our Two Burrito's after waiting almost 30 minutes in their lobby + the 10+ we spent in line? (I know I know...what did I expect going there between 11am-1pm...but seriously they have all the ingredients made, it's just an assembly line, Chipotle Style dang it) so anyway, the food took way too long and $17.49 later for one green chile regular burrito and one red enchilada style burrito with rice and beans (in the hood) had me complaining about my planned 'cheap' lunch before I took my first bite.  \nI'm not gonna lie the burrito's are tasty and a good size, other comments mentioned salty and greasy and yes that is true on both, but that's why the place is famous for its simple salty/greasy food.  I have had better for the same or less $$ and for a much better atmosphere...that place is making a killing they could have maybe some more shaded cheap/vintage seating a sign a mural something...give the place a little character and I can maybe feel better about spending my hard earned $$ there.  Anyway not my most favorable review but I think Rito's has taken their fame to their head and caters to the foodies/downtown administrative crowd vs. the working class and neighborhood area peeps."
0,"Buyer beware! I was really looking forward to dining here after being a Giada fan for a long time but left very disappointed and very questionable I would ever be back. Food and service were extremely subpar especially given the prices. The best part was probably the ambiance -- it is a beautiful space overlooking the Strip. We went for lunch so the sun shining in the dining room was nice.\n\nWe started with an order of the olives. They were supposed to be warm as noted on the menu but they were room temperature. Not a good way to start but the complimentary bread (it was like pizza crust) with pesto made up for it.\n\nWe ordered:\n1. Carbonara pasta -- Probably the worst carbonara I have ever had. They should call is something else because it is nothing like the traditional Roman specialty. Before ordering I asked the server what the carbonara is like, whether it's eggy -- I always do this when ordering carbonara anywhere because so many restaurants butcher this dish -- and she said it's \""very good with only a hint of cream and one of my favorite dishes on the menu.\"" So I felt confident it was going to be great. Instead I got one of the smallest portions of pasta I have ever seen (more like an appetizer portion for $24!) that was barely warm in a bland cream sauce with a few specks of bacon or pancetta (there was so little of it I couldn't tell) and onion. Not at all what I had expected so I only had a few bites.\n2. Margarita pizza -- Barely any sauce or cheese. Tomatoes were sundried. Came out cold and pretty dry. Definitely not oven fresh.\n3. Lasagna -- This was the pasta of the day and definitely the best choice of the three entrees we ordered. That said it was a pretty generic lasagna and nothing special about it. Came with an arugula salad.\n\nAfter the dishes were served it took at least 15 minutes for anyone to come by to check on us. My husband had finished his pizza by the time the store manager happened to stop by as she was making her rounds. When I told her I was disappointed about my carbonara she immediately took action and the server came over to replace my dish. I asked for the soup instead (minestrone) -- I wanted something quick since everyone else was pretty much done with their meals --  which sadly again, was bland and very disappointing. \n\nTo the restaurant's credit they addressed our situation with a lot of apologies and complimentary cookies which were delicious -- peanut butter chocolate, lemon ricotta and chocolate chip. Next time maybe I should skip the main meal and go back just for dessert."
1,"I now live very close to Zada Jane's so over the July 4th weekend, my husband and I went to check it out early on that Saturday. We were the only table so far outside but by 9 the tables were filling fast. \nWe were greeted with smiles and sat outside when we said we wanted to be out there and our server came out soon after to ask if we wanted the umbrella down so the sun was not in our eyes. That is attentive.\nI got coffee and my husband, tea, and I like that they seem to use random, Goodwill like mugs so you don't know what you will get. I got Howdy Doody! Good stuff.\nAnyway..to food. My man got the Basic Breakfast with the sausage patties (yum) and I built my own; over easy egg, biscuit with herb gravy and the fruit cup. The herb gravy was a generous bowl, for me anyway, and I shared some with my dining partner so he could add them to his roasted potatoes. I also was given fresh berry jam for my biscuit. I did not eat it all and took it home for later. \nI suggest going, but if you pick a busy time like later morning on a weekend, you will wait. They have shuffleboard and corn hold games though for you or the kids.\nAnd dogs are allowed outside. They even had samples for the little pups!"
1,"One of the best take-out meals I've ever had. A group of us shared #31 Larp (with pork), #11 Kang Gai soup (w/chicken), #28 Mango Curry (w/ tofu), #19 Phra Lam Durn Don (w/chicken), and the Spring Rolls (both shrimp and tofu). We had the \""timid\"" spice level for everything except the soup, which was \""careful.\"" The soup and Phra Lam were so very, very good. I could go for a big bowl of their peanut sauce right now. The curry was also great. The spring rolls were fine - we all liked the shrimp variety better than the tofu. The Larp dish was the only one we didn't finish (and lick the container) - too much ginger for my taste. Not terrible, but not nearly as good as the other dishes. I can't wait to return to Lao Laan-Xang!"
0,"If you wish to be completely ignored, this is the place for you. \n\nLeft due to complete lack of service while others that came in after were served.\n \nChecked Trip Advisor as well. The lack of service and dismissive staff are definitely a consistent issue here. \n\nGo anyplace other than this. \n\nChef Keller I expected better than this. \n\nPerhaps Chef Colicchio can stop by and offer your staff some training. We experienced top notch service at Craftsteak."
0,"Oh Blue Martini, what can I say about this place. First off, this is a pick up bar for locals. That's it. If you want to get laid, more than likely you can go home with someone and it won't be too hard. I certainly have met people here when I've wanted to hook up as have maaaany others. True, it can be an eclectic mix of people sometimes,  it's mostly filled with Vegas versions of the Jersey Shore. The drinks are way over priced and are just sub par. The bartenders are hot and seem to serve their purpose in that sense, but aren't outstanding mixologists (like they get hired on how well they make a cocktail in the first place). Basically, are you lonely? Are you decent looking and want  to just get laid? This is your place."
0,"I was thinking this place was gonna be \nGood. I WAS SO!!! Wrong!!! When we walked\nIn we seen a sign that says, seat your self.\nWe did.

Ok this is vegas\nPut your air on! It was hotter inside then it was \nOutdoors. I will never eat here again. I can not put\nInto words how bad the meat was. I feel sick just \nThinking about it.

1,"Located within walking distance of Bank One Ballpark (MLB's Diamondbacks) and US Airways Center (NBA's Phoenix Suns) Majerle's (owned by three-time NBA all-star and local icon Dan Majerle) is a great place to go before and after a game. \n\nWeekend afternoons--game day or not--are relatively quiet, which means quick service and an attentive wait staff.  And while the food is typical of most sports grills (burgers, sandwiches, and fried appetizers, for example), it's a great place to unwind or to escape the Phoenix heat.  There are the requisite large televisions tuned to the day's sporting events and plenty of memorabilia lining the walls.  Despite these sports bar staples, the place is actually quite cozy and quaint.\n\nBut while Majerle's is good in the afternoons, it absolutely rocks after Suns or D-Backs games.  The place is typically packed and it's not uncommon to find local or visiting athletes sipping beers on the narrow sidewalk patio.  The bartenders are personable and charming and it's not unusual for one of them to grab the mic and wander the restaurant singing karaoke (and singing it well).  The spontaneity of patrons singing duets with the bartender or serenading their dates to late-'80s pop ballads makes for a great party-like atmosphere."
0,"We had the crab-pineapple dip with wontons for an appetizer. Crab and pineapple in a tasteless white goo, really a bad idea. We really did not want to put together our idea of a bowl of food, but that's the way it works. The beef in our dish had several pieces of gristle, and the rest of the dish was a bit overcooked for my taste. We did try several of the sauces but none did anything worthy of mention. The chocolate-filled wantons with a whipped cream side were very good, and my extra-dirty traditional gin martini was very cold and surprisingly good. Service is friendly but untrained. Several times our server should have seen we needed extra plates or silverware, but she was oblivious. We were sadly disappointed."
0,"Oh Bibi's! We could have been so good together!\n\nNever one to turn down a gander at a pretty bakery, I thought I'd just have a quick peek inside. Two macarons later, I was on my way. I got a huge whiff of cupcakey goodness walking through the door and was pretty taken by the lovely colourful baked goods lined up next to the counter.\n\nAfter reading mixed reviews about the cupcakes on Yelp, I decided to try a salted caramel and a raspberry macaron for \u00a31.75 each. I love macarons and have baked many in my time. These macaron shells were very bumpy, a bit too cake textured and the cream inside was very buttery and rich. Not only was the texture a bit off, but neither of the macarons tasted much like the flavours they claimed to be.\n\nAesthetically, this place is nice. The cupcakes and macarons all look very cute. Overall verdict? Just a bit too pricey for the quality of product that is offered."
0,"The only real reason I find myself in a 7-11 is to get a Slurpee. The other night was no different.

1,"I went with my partner for brunch on a Monday. I had an egg with cheese on an English muffin. I liked it a lot. The presentation was nice. I had regular brewed coffee and it was good. I'd heard mixed things about the coffee but it was great.\n\nMy partner ordered eggs over easy with toast, but complained that they were overdone. We both thought that the water tasted a bit weird, but that's most likely because it's from KW groundwater.\n\nOverall, Seven Shores has a really great atmosphere and the staff are very nice. I've been going for a while and I'll definitely keep coming back."
1,"This location in Mesa Riverview is one of the smaller ones that I've been in before to get my hair cut.  That said, I have gotten the most consistent haircut from all of the stylists (4 to date).  \n\nFor me that is something to be said since I enjoy having some stability in how my hair is going to look every 3-4 weeks.  I like wearing a baseball hat but not because I'm embarrassed to have my hair be seen.\n\nWith the ability to check in online or via their mobile app, there is no longer any waiting in the cramped waiting area; of which there are only 8 seats I believe.  With the checking in option, I can wait at home or run other errands before showing up and getting my hair cut as soon as I walk in."

0,"Not sure what the hell happened, because this used to be my go-to DD location for good service and good donuts. Today, that was not to be.\n\nWe went in and ordered a couple dozen, including half a dozen Boston Cremes. It looks like they had a trainee Finisher working today, because only one of them are frosted right, and the other 5 were done by someone incompetent. I have pics to prove it, available upon request.\n\nATTENTION FINISHER: when the chocolate frosting is too thick for the shells, you're supposed to thin it out with hot coffee, then continue frosting the shells in the correct manner. What you are NOT supposed to do is use a frosting knife and try to spread it on the shells. Two things happen when you do it wrong: the shells tear, and you have to throw away a bunch, and the shells don't get the right amount of frosting, and they look awful.\n\nAlso, several other of the filled donuts were not filled, and only had a blop of the filling on the outside where the fill hole would normally go. This newbie Finisher was really awful. I know of which I speak: I was a weekend graveyard Finisher for 2 years in my mis-spent youth, and as a Finisher, I would never have trayed up this crap.\n\nAnyway, when my coworker tried to call and complain to the manager, what she got was a snotty \""well, they have frosting on them, so technically they're fine\"", instead of something like \""I apologize for the bad food, here's [something to appease you].\""\n\nThis location normally has good products and good customer service, but not this morning.\n\nUnfortunate. I hope they can get the team replaced with an effective one. \n\nNote to DD Franchise Owner: If you want me to come in and train your new finishers, let me know... we can work something out."

0,"Was excited about the opening of a BBQ place in Chandler.  Went on Saturday, the day after the grand opening, and it was very busy.  We weren't able to find a seat so we decided to leave a few minutes after arriving and the owner (nor staff) didn't seem to be aware nor worried that people were leaving.   \n\nHowever that didn't keep me from giving it another try today since I was in the mood for BBQ. I got there and decided to order a slice beef sandwich and a piece of sausage.  I ended up having to buy a sausage sandwich since they didn't sell a piece of sausage separately.   Unfortunately, when I got my food I was very disappointed.\n\nThe slice beef sandwich was mush and more like a soggy pulled pork sandwich.  The meat had been soaked in beef broth to keep it moist but it made it lose it's flavor and didn't have any smoked flavor.  They covered the sandwich in BBQ sauce which is something a BBQ piece of meat shouldn't need.   The owner came over and asked me about the meat and when I mentioned that I was expecting a slice beef sandwich and that the meat was mushy he insisted that it was sliced beef but so tender that they can't keep it together.  As a BBQ conisseur, I've had many tender sliced beef sandwiches that don't taste like mush. \n\n The sausage sandwich was some funky piece of sausage that tasted and looked horrible.   When I talked to the owner he once again defended it saying it was a Louisanna sausage and has the right balance of meat and spices and still didn't seem interested in his customer's feedback or satisfaction.\n\nSo overall, my first visit was not what I expected.  I probably won't go back but if I do it will be a while from now and hopefully the owner will be more open to feedback. That is if they are still open."
1,omg! wow!!! that was amaze-balls!!!! BF had biscuts and gravy he loved it i had catfish and cheddar jalapino(sp?) grits! wowwww!!! service was sooo nice!!!! the cute short girl with short hair was so sweet. we WILL be back! we used our groupon and after that we paid $6!!! worth every single penny!!! the sweet tea was fantastic!
1,"How can you do better than this for fresh food at a great value in a bohemian asmosphere?  You can't.  The hummus is smooth (and great with chicken), the gyros are stuffed with flavor, and the signature dish is the chicken del sol... Get it in you."
1,"First Impression:\nOrdering a burrito involves deciding between two different sizes of burros? Reg and XL. I went with the regular on account of my personal mission to fight the obesity epidemic, one bite, one burrito at a time. Turns out I was siding with the models on this one, and not those Dove approves. The burrito regular is on the small side, and costs $5.99. I suppose it is intended to lighten my figure and my wallet, simultaneously. Regarding carne asada -- it is indeed legit, there is a lot of flavor packed into the tiny tortilla. Lots of flavor, just the right amount of juice, some fresh onions lightly grilled (also inside), and a side of salsa. The hot salsa, is not spicy, but it has good flavor.\n\nOn my second visit I came by on a Sunday morning to try the breakfast burrito. There was a daily special and the XL size cost only $4.50. Filled with chorizo, eggs, beans and cheese and accompanied with a side of salsa, it turned out to be 3/5 stars. The chorizo was mild, not the kind that would show up at your Grandma's house for breakfast if you were from Douglas, AZ. I found out that the XL size is really a normal people size burrito. I wonder if this taco shop is catering to ASU sorority girls. \n\nThey get get 4 stars for dynamite flavor on the carne."
0,"So this is a really cheap golf course.. It is fine for beginners. \n\nIt is not in the best shape. It is what it is.\n\nThey have a range as well... They have carts for the course.\n\nIt is short.. \n\nDoubtful I would go back. But for people starting out, it should work for them."
0,"I agreed with reviewer, ' Ima yelp'.  What a rip off.  $12.00 for a small bowl of noodles. I find nothing special about their food that can justify double price.  Taste, texture, ingredient, serving size - everything is the same as other Vietnamese restaurants that normally charge between $5 -$ 7.00."
1,Just recently moved to Las Vegas from Cali. This place was right by my house so I went in to office to get a quote. It was a Saturday and I was happy they were open!!! I got to meet with the agent Jen and she was super friendly and down to earth. I highly recommend this office if you want a friendly staff and great deal! :)
0,"I thought this was the closest location to me, but it isn't! \n\nI only like the chicken tacos and green sauce, pretty good. Not tex mex though!"
1,"Building was gorgeous. Service had a little to be desired. Friendly, but not very efficient. We ordered burritos, probably should've ordered tacos. They were good, but not enough to bring me back. I would go back to try the tacos."
1,"Finally tried this place out for lunch with the goal being to get some sushi.  The decor is nice and crisp/modern and I like the bar area where there is a TV.  We got there on the early side (little after 11:30am) and were promptly seated and our waitress took our drink order.  I asked her  how the Sumo Salad was prepared, as I didn't find it to be clear from the menu, and she couldn't remember.  She said something about cucumbers and a special sauce, then said \""what do you mean\""?  \n\nSo I gave up on that idea and went with the Shrimp Lettuce Cups for an app and the Sashimi Salad for the main.  The filling in the lettuce cups was perfectly prepared; I'd I'd order them again.  The Sashimi salad had tons of fish and avocado in it; you don't really even need the Asian Dressing because of  how the fish is prepared.  \n\nThe waitress brought our salads out while we were half way through our appetizer, which drives my husband BON KERRRRS, so he put it on another table (haha).  I must have looked really tired b/c she brought me new diet cokes when I was half way through the first AND asked me if I wanted one to go.  If I was drinking alcoholic beverages, being overserved wouldn't have bothered me.  \n\nAll that being said, she was very nice, but possibly new at being a waitress.  I will definitely go back to try out the sushi and some of the other items on the menu, because they all looked right up my alley.  I'd probably give it a 4.5 for food and a 2.5 for service but rounding up to 4 stars."
1,"It pains me to write this as this is probably our absolute fav Farmers Market, but yesterday (Sept 2, 2013) a big fire destroyed the main building.  \n\nLatest news report is here ---  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/story/2013/09/02/waterloo-st-jacobs-fire.html\n\nNot sure what they will do in the interim - but if you are intending to go out there, please be sure to check and make sure that some of the stalls are open.\n\nPlease note that some of the shops in town may have some items on offer.  The Stone Crock has a good bakery and there is a butcher shop next door to it."
0,"Edit 1/15/2014:  Since my original posting in April 2012, I have ordered here a bunch of times with good consistent quality each time but this most recent experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I won't be ordering here anymore.  I ordered my usual Mongolian beef dinner, order of Pork Fried Rice, and crab puffs and the lady who took my order can recite it from memory every time which is amazing.  So I trusted her to do the same in this instance and thought my order would arrive all good.   \n\nAfter my husband got the food from the driver and paid, we unpacked everything and his usual order of Pork Fried Rice was missing.  Turns out, the lady who took my order upgraded my plain fried rice in my entree to the Pork Fried Rice for a $2 upcharge and didn't correctly put in the entree order of the fried rice.  I immediately called the restuarant back as soon as the driver left to let them know and she explained the confusion and whatnot and said she would send the missing item ASAP.  \n\nDriver comes back within 20 mins and we got hit with an addition $7 charge for the Pork Fried Rice.  We paid it of course but since it was the restuarant's mistake, I was hoping for a small discount to even out the upgraded fried rice that I DID NOT WANT in my entree.  I ended up giving my fried rice to my husband so he could have an extra helping.  We have been cutting back on ordering out more and more over the years and this is something that will be definitely be cut out for good.  What a shame.  I liked them too.\n\n\nOriginal: I was looking for a chinese delivery place that I haven't tried yet and I found this place through Yelp.  Because of the high reviews and that I am in its delivery range, I decided to order.\n\nIt was a Saturday night when I placed the order and a nice woman answered (it could've been the owner that other reviews mentioned) and I started asking her a bunch of questions about a couple dishes and she was patient and informative which helped me tremendously in deciding what I wanted and having a great dining experience.  She gave me the final total, which I noticed many Chinese places don't do for some reason and I absolutely appreciated it for bookkeeping on my part, and an estimated delivery time of 30 to 40 minutes.\n\nThe guy came right on time and he was very friendly.  The food was nice and steamy and still piping hot after all that time.  I am a fan and as I order more from here I will either increase the rating to 5 stars or if I start having bad experiences will decrease it accordingly.  I hope I don't have bad experiences because this place has some great quality food!"
1,"Pure is clutch man. Went on a Sunday night this time and the party was poppin'. We were originally at XS, but that place is just too big for its own good sometimes. So we cabbed it over to Pure and it was well worth it.\n\nSuggestion: do a little legwork and grab some free passes during the day. Even though we got there post midnight, we just gave the passes and got in, no cover. Also, no line really either. \n\nOnly the rooftop was open, but that's like the best part of Pure anyway. We got our drinks in a reasonable amount of time. Everyone seemed pretty friendly, and my buddy got in a C-walk battle with some Eastern European man. A good time was had by all."
0,"I have been going to All American Eyeglass Repair for several years. I always change out nose pads on my sunglasses to silicone nonslip pads. They cost around $30 depending on type of frames. They normally have friendly and knowledgeable staffs there and never had any problems before. I even recommended to friends and co-workers. Last time I was there, there was this crazy old witch there and she was so rude and made a big deal about adjusting my glasses. She said she had to charge me $15 to adjust my sunglasses because they weren't purchased there. WHAT?!?! I've been taking all of my glasses there for repairs and never had any problems with free fitting. When they replaced the nose pads, the staff always adjust to make sure they fit properly. The guy that worked on my glasses told me to wear for a day and see how they fit and bring back for readjustment if needed. This crazy lady (I believe she's the owner) tried to charge me a fee. I had to argue with her till she finally agree to adjust at no charge. She was freakin nuts! Every eyeglass place I've ever been always adjust at no charge even though I did not purchase them there. I will not give them any more business and will not be going back."
0,Absolutely the worst Chinese food I have ever had.  Chicken curry was tasteless soup the same. NEVER again
0,"Boy oh boy ! Where should I start from ? Nose hair on the plate, flies on the soya sauce or the rude waiter ? \nSushi- all we get in Montreal are 9/10 sushi places run by Chinese, FYI sushi is Japanese. There are still good Chinese run sushi places. This one is just a disgrace to sushi. Soggy rice, frozen tempura and waiter with rude demeanour. This place is a No Go. \nLet alone be the quality , it's nothing personal bit personal hygiene."
1,"I had lunch here and enjoyed it.  I liked the d\u00e9cor and the ambience.  They were playing some mood music with a beat which wasn't too loud.  I wanted a beet salad and tried their version with prosciutto.  While I was waiting for my salad, they provided me with their bread which was really good.  The rolls were served warm and had a thin skin with a nice, fluffy interior. The butter was soft as well and easily spread on the bread.\n\nI had never had prosciutto with a beet salad but it worked really well.  There was a nice mix of flavors with the sharp taste of the blue cheese blending well with the savory prosciutto with the acidity of the balsamic dressing.  They also had some beans for texture which I think works really well with beet salads in general.  The golden beets were sweet and tasty, but they could have added more beets for color and balance.\n\nMy server was attentive and friendly and service was great overall.  The price was $21 including tip and was good value considering the quality here.  I will have to try the dinner options the next time I am around."
0,"I've been coming to this location for two reasons, good service, and entertainment from the bus stop outside.  However, recently, I've experienced not so great service.  Gosh, I wish the teens working at night would just pay attention. Two weeks in a row now I've gotten the wrong order.  \n First one last week, cheesy gordita crunch with chicken. I got a hard shell taco w/ chicken, cheese, and lettuce in it.   Bean and cheese burrito....I got a beef and cheese burrito. Maybe it's my east coast accent? I don't know.   Yesterday, cheesy gordita crunch with chicken. I got a gordita with chicken and cheese. Um hi, either you don't carry that one anymore, or the person reading the recipe does not know what they're doing?  Hard shell chicken taco encased by a soft shell tortilla w/ cheese between the two shells.  What is the issue?  I'm going to try another location until these workers move on to the next job."
0,"First time here with my baby for a date night dinner. The server was really nice and the services is really good. I wasn't really happy with the steak, I'm sure the chef can do better than what I can cook at home. I ask for medium rare. And the steak come out bloody rare with no flavor at all. I was really disappointed with the steak. I normally go to Mon abi gabi at Paris. And the steak have soo much flavor and cook the way I wanted. Lucky my gf order some lobster, so I ate the steak with lobster at the same time so I won't give up on the steak so fast. But then I find a hair on the lobster. That just Kill dinner. I work 10 hours today. Didn't eat anything all day. I'm saving my belly for this dinner. Wasn't really happy about it. So the manager come over and he did his job well. He said he won't charge us for the mistake they make. But what make me write this review because I was so piss when I saw the bills. I feel like I'm being rib off. He did take off the lobster part but then he charged steak witch I had 2 bite and I don't want to eat it anymore after I saw the hair. I own a business my self. When the customer is not happy about my services ? I won't charge them and even offer them to come back with a free services. This is the right way to run a business FYI. I pay $150+ for my dinner. I end up cooking instant noodles at home because I didn't get to enjoy my steak dinner :("
1,"I've been here twice now, once for a massage and once for a wax, and both times it was exceptional. The masseuse was fantastic and gave me pointers and stretches to do regularly to ease the knotting and tension in my back after the amazing massage, and the esthetician I saw made me more comfortable than I ever thought I could be in such a situation. The relaxation retreat is so much nicer than just waiting in a waiting room, with music and tea and a beautiful view to help you relax a bit. I will definitely be going back regularly! Also, if you sign up for the emails they send out 3 times a week, you can save a bunch of money, sometimes 25% off, which is lovely."
0,"Go to Hash House a Go Go if you crave enormous piles of low quality, deep-fried  ingredients served on huge plates.  The presentation of the food is ridiculous.  I believe the goal is to stack the food as high as possible and add a very large rosemary tree (not sprig, but tree) to the top for maximum height.  I saw many dishes being served to others.  If the entree didn't have a rosemary tree sticking out of the top, then it had a steak knife standing straight up from whatever it was stabbing.  Each entree measures about 8\""-11\"" high.  I can't even begin to imagine what the calorie count is per dish.  Restaurants like this help me understand why we have an obesity problem in this country.\n\nWe ordered the salmon and chicken penne entrees.  The food was completely flavorless.  My salmon was served over a massive glob of potatoes (and adorned with a rosemary tree).  My husband's chicken was stacked on a skewer sticking into a half apple (and topped with a rosemary tree).  Our sodas had no bubbles.  They were like watery syrup.  We switched to water, which we have never done before.  The sodas were really that bad.\n\nThe music selection was odd and quite annoying - a slow, sad song, followed by a few head-banger tunes, back to slow, sad, then punk, and then a latin rhythm.  Just weird.\n\nService was fast but unfriendly.\n\n$66 for two disgusting dinners. \n\nWe picked this place because of all the great reviews on yelp.  What a disappointment!  We ate there last night and both my husband and myself still feel sick this morning from the load of garbage still sitting in our stomachs.  I can't wait to take a shit."
1,"I was so looking forward our dinner here. I took my husband here for his 30th birthday and I waited for this day like a kid that's ready to meet Mickey & Co.    Few hours prior to our dinner, I ended up having the worst stomach ache and I couldn't even try anything, other then a bite of caviar(YUMMO), a bite of his lobster dish.   Shame, Shame, Shame (on me).\nHe ended up polishing 12 course meal all by himself and walked out of there like he just had the best sex ever. I'm sure it was orgasmic by his reaction. Since I can't speak too much for the food, I will just say their decor was over the top and the service was bit \""smothering\"" to say the least.  Our waiter literally stood right next to our table while we were eating the entire time (while I was sipping on hot water/lemon).  \nOhhhh.. and the candy wagon they brought out at the end. OMG!!!!!"
1,"This place is always a stop when i am out in AZ.  Loves it!!!!!!!!!! Great burger, great fries, not too expensive, usually pretty quick.  I only wish they had in-n-out where i live.   I like to stick  with the double double and fries.  My gf likes to get her fries well done.  Its a nice option if you like them extra crispy, but regular tastes fine to me."
1,We just did our first phone order with them. It was very easy. The young lady helped immensely and was knowledgeable about toys for a 4 year old. Shipping was VERY reasonable and we will be ordering more from them. This is how toy stores used to be when I was kid.
0,Decent buffet but definitely not worth the $37+ per person on the weekend.
1,"We ordered a large pizza, half with pepperoni and mushrooms; and half with pepperoni, Pepperoncini, jalape\u00f1o, and garlic. We also ordered the jalape\u00f1o poppers, and the garlic mozzarella bread. \n\nThe pizza is simply one of the best I ever had, was very delicious, I only ate the spicy side, but the wife and kids said the other side was very good as well. The bread was good as well, though I would had liked a bit more garlic. The poppers were decent but not great, they were a cream cheese popper and I like cheddar better, so it just may be me. \n\nWe ordered using the eat24 app and they said 45-60 minutes. I honestly didn't watch the clock but somehow I doubt it took longer than 30 minutes. \n\nI was hesitant to eat here because their other location has bad reviews, but I had noticed that many were due to people being mad about flyers on their door. All in all I am really glad I decided to give them a try and I will be ordering from here again!"
1,"Wow, what a fun restaurant!  Being from out of town, I was told by many people to take a little adventure off of the strip and go try it out.  What a great decision.\n\nThe menu is tapas style, which is basically my favorite thing in the entire world.  I mean, you can get so many different flavors and varieties (each at around $6 or something) all while appreciating the ambiance and fun atmosphere!\n\nOur table ordered the big bowl salad to start, followed by the stuffed dates (AMAZING! GET THESE!!!), spicy beef salad, manchego mac 'n' cheese, ahi tuna skewer, camarones a la diabla, sliders, chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms, merguez, firefly fries, and we all shared the seafood paella.  Everything....EVERYTHING....was wonderful! \n\nThis sounds like a lot of food, but keep in mind that it is tapas style.. Between 7 girls, it came out to be like 2-4 bites per dish!  They were perfect for sharing!  Also, our server was spectacular and everything was served relatively quickly, given the restaurant was packed!\n\nOh, try their blackberry and raspberry infused vodka and/or a pitcher of the blood orange mojitos.  Trust me, you will love.\n\nThis will be one of the first stops when I go back to Vegas!!"
0,"I was checking prices for cheap hotels on Expedia.  I came across this hotel for very cheap during the week.  It was a MAZE to the parking garage from Las Vegas Blvd!  I'm surprised that I found a spot.  Hopefully I will remember where the car is parked.  I'm scared about that.  I know what level I am on, but I took like 3 different elevators to check in.  \n\nThe hotel is under construction.  The line was very long (Late at night).  Hour later I finally was served.  The lady said that there is a $11.00 \""Resort Fee\"".  I'm like, WHAT?!?!  Resort Fee?!  When's my Tee time?!  She giggled.  I said that I wasn't aware of that fee.\n\nI was tired, so I paid it and was going to leave a poor review on Expedia.  I sign in and I coudn't leave feedback on Expedia!  I kept following the links to leave feedback.  The only feedback I could leave was for Expedia themselves (Which I did).  Too bad they got the brunt of my poor attitude.  They received 1 star, and I will not be using them again.  Soooo many places that can get me a deal!\n\nSo....  I would read the fine print first!  Their so-called \""Resort Fee\"" is going up to $15.00/night August 1, 2013.\n\nThe room is mediocre.  I stayed in Tower 5.  It's an older hotel, so it's not fancy like the Cosmo (Killer place!).\n\nIf you want to find a cheap hotel (So you have more $$$ for gambling/etc), you won't save much here!!  They mask it up so you 'think' you are saving."
1,I've bought several cars here through the years. Both new and used and have had nothing but great experiences. Nice people.
1,The Burgers taste like in and out burgers and tehy are just as good. Great service and great attutude from everyone. Cheap to eat here with a good portion of what ever you order.
0,"I went here with my husband on a friday. Less than half capacity and seated ourselves. After seating we waited about 10 minutes to place our order. Our drinks were served after another 5 minutes and we waited and waited for our pancakes... more than 25 minutes. Once the food arrived we were so excited to dig into our meals. I noticed the nice scoop of softly melting butter onto of my  banana waffle and it actually looked so fluffy and light I tasted a small bit to be sure it wasn't whip cream. My mouth was greeted by a small, but overwhelmingly crucial detail....they used salted butter. Not just lightly salted butter....this was REALLY salty butter. I quickly try to scrape as much butter off the pancake, but alas, it had mostly already soaked into the waffle. Even after pouring more than a comfortable amount of maple syrup onto the waffle it was so salty. I tried to move on to the bacon instead and then I really got upset. THEY SALTED THE BACON TOO!!!!  Who does that?!?! It was inedible, but even a little bit made my mouth dry. I asked my husband about his meal and he had the same problem. Salty pancakes.  So, terrible food and lackluster service make this a no-go in my book. Sorry, wanted to like it. Just didn't happen."
0,"This place has been around a long time, and I've been there quite a few times. It's hard to find decent Cajun food in Phoenix, but Kay's usually does pretty well.\n\nOur last visit wasn't the greatest. The duck & andouille gumbo was nice, if not quite piping hot. I forgave that, as it's one of the few places around you cna find duck of any kind, or andouille for that matter. The shrimp etouffe came out stone cold, and the waitress quickly returned it to the kitchen where they nuked it to almost hot. Microwaved etouffee just isn't right. \n\nAn order of dirty rice with a side of 2 links of andouille proved almost pointless, as we specifically made clear this was an entree, and expected the 2 links to be cut up and added to the rice. What we got was a small bowl of dirty rice with two tiny breakfast-sized links laid atop it.  \n\nThe crab cakes weren't bad, being mostly crab with little bread crumbs, but they really didn't scream authentic cajun cakes to me. Plus, they too were a bit on the cold side - even though everything came out quickly. \n\nOn the plus side, they have Abita beers on tap. Turbo Dog is always welcomed - especially if it's on tap. \n\nAnother plus is you can stop in on a weekend night (we went on a Saturday) even at 9p and they are open. The place was empty barring a few people at the bar. That should be your clue. \n\nMy previous experiences here were all around lunchtime, with no problems as far as food temp, so I suspect that late night diners are getting food that has been sitting around in a steamer all day long. \n\nRegardless, I am only giving this 2 stars. Your mileage may vary."
1,"Mmmmmm, delicious.  However, who serves cupcakes, cakes, and other desserts without having milk or soy available??!! I've never heard of such a thing.\n\nThey have plenty of other types of beverages, but again, no milk or soy. The coffee isn't that great either.\n\nSo enough with the beverages, that's not why you go there. The desserts are a treat for the eyes and for the tastebuds. You will definitely get your sugar fix in this upscale establishment. \n\nI went here on my anniversary and our cupcakes came out with sparklers on top. They sure know how to add a little happiness to the night. I was so impressed by the desserts I brought my family when they came to visit. It's definitely a place to impress others!"
0,"The place is tidy & clean, and the yogurt is so-so (the 2 flavors I picked were tasty, but not totally frozen - a bit watery).  I agree with Bill F.  - was put off by the fact that the price per ounce is NOT posted anywhere, and to my surprise, had to pay $6 for a cup of yogurt that would have cost $4 at other places.  Probably not going back... will seek out a less expensive spot for my sweet tooth fix!"
1,"This was my first Rock N Roll event, and after doing a few other big races I was psyched to finally check out a Rock N Roll. I figured expensive as it was, there must be something special about it, right!? Ummm, its just like any other race. I ran Las Vegas a few years ago before Rock N Roll bought it out and I did not really see a difference other then the price and Brett Michaels. I was expecting a cool shirt, come to find out everyone gets a men's size shirt. I ordered a small and I swim in it, oh well, into the heap of ugly running shirts it goes. \n\nI got to my corral, and could not figure out how to get into it, everything was gated off all the way around. A lot of runners were wandering back and forth trying to find a way into the damn corrals. I saw like 20 people just give up and hop the barrier, and followed right after them. Corrals could have been better organized...\n\n...and while we're talking about corrals, walkers, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE! If you are a walker don't freaking lie and clog up the course, get in the back and move it slo mo!\n\nI spent a large portion of time weaving around people walking 4 and 5 abreast blocking the entire course. Seriously? I finished in 2:05 and I know I could have broken 2 hours if I hadn't been forced to come to a dead stop on more than one occassion because of traffic.\n\nSeeing all the Elvises, hotels, people getting married, and awesome cheerleaders and volunteers is what really makes this race worth running again, even if it is 20 degrees out! Next year I'm starting in a closer corral and breaking 2 hours!"
0,Just ok - I think I had higher expectations.
0,"Dragged here about a month ago by a friend who got some postcard somewhere. Figured I would review this for those looking for night-life. Looks all Euro-trendy. We all need to go to a bass-thumping DJ driven club once in awhile. I did find it interesting that \""dressy\"" for females is mini-dress. For guys it means their T shirt is tucked into their faded jeans (at least for the first half of the night). I have adjusted to the AZ relaxed dress code. Still seems weird to me, couples where female looks like a runway model, guy-with looks like he just got out of work at Home Depot. I guess I spent too much of the time thinking about this and conducting a scientific study. Anyhow, loud music, lots of glitz and glam, a necessary part of every young person's life. Lots of people looked way too young to be here. Some people looked way too old to be here. I think the thrill of standing behind the velvet ropes and waiting to be let in adds to the allure. It's just not my thing. I am sure I will be dragged back when my East coast friends come to visit."
0,"I haven't written a bad review, but I feel that this would really benefit future customers. This particular location is always so crowded, which contributes to the long wait for a table and their slow service. There is also an awful smell that fills the restaurant at least that is what I experienced when I was there. \n\nAnyway after a long wait, our server had finally noticed us and took our order. I had ordered the steak tips and a side of pancakes. It took a while for our food to come and after getting my food I realized that my pancakes were never delivered. I told another server because our server was not around. The lady said she was sorry and that it would be out, but still no pancakes. I had to tell someone else that I didn't receive my pancakes. That server forgot as well. After being halfway through my meal I just didn't want to bother having my pancakes anymore so I just asked them not to charge me for it. \n\nYou would thing they would have given me a free meal or something but they just took off $3. It was such a disappointing experience. The food is good, but their customer service needs improvement."
1,"Great place.  Brought in two jackets that were no longer wearable and now they look wonderful.  The \""alteration\"" was done quickly and at a very reasonable price.  I would highly recommend."
1,"This is definitely a south Scottsdale hidden gem that has turned into one of my favorite places to grab lunch during the work week.\n\nThe first time I discovered them was due to the fact that they had breakfast all day. And well, if you know me, you know this usually brings a place up a notch in my book. I love my breakfast. Their heaven sent omelet is spectacular.\n\nTheir italian soda comes with cream on the side so you can add as much as you want. Yum!!\n\nAdditionally the grilled cheese is to die for. I am *not* a fan of tomatoes at all but for some reason their tomato bisque I actually somewhat enjoy. And it comes with cheddar goldfish. Oh yes. And this isn't a kids meal either.\n\nIf you're a Chicago native or Chicago sports fan (which I am not), you will be especially impressed."
1,"Great coffee, excellent tea, and astute service is what you will find here.  They  have a limited selection of breads and pastries if you're hungry, and the wireless internet can be unreliable at times.  It's always clean, and it's usually easy to get an outlet.  Steep & Brew does attract a decent number of non-studying people which may make for loud distracting conversations, so bring your headphones if you have ADD like me."
0,"The breakfast buffet at one time was arguably the best in Las Vegas, but it has continued to deteriorate under Harrah's ownership.  My menu included OJ, Lyonnaise potatoes (terrible), strawberries with yogurt, a variety of cheeses, a hard boiled egg Benedict (yuck) and Andouille sausage"
1,"If there's something that I cannot find at any other supercenter, Target usually has it. This store is nice because it's clean, and still yet goes a bit unnoticed by people. It has a Starbucks and a food center, like all usually do. Their clothes section is also pretty great too, although a bit pricey. People are right when they say come to Target for more quality!"
0,"This is not a complaint against JUST this particular WalMart! Consumers beware! I believed their ads about cashing checks for $3 each. I went to WalMart to cash my payroll check (because my bank was closed and I need the $ to pay my rent). I put in my social security number and was refused. Of course they don't tell you why; I'm thinking it has to do with the company I work for. Turns out...WALMART will ONLY cash checks for people with superior credit. NOW, shouldn't they say that in their ads instead of wasting my time finding a place to park and then waiting in line as customer service just to be refused? I was humiliated!  What does MY credit have to do with cashing my payroll check????? I will NEVER step foot in WALMART again!"
1,Staying at the Mandalay Bay for a convention and decided to have Mexican for breakfast.  Had the Huevos Rancheros.  Very delicious.  Really some of the best I've ever had and for $18 it should be!
0,"For being on the Strip, and holding up a reputation, the price was comparable but the quality was just not.... there. There wasn't much to choose from.... no salad toppings for salads, incomplete good stations, lots of empty slots and not even chicken in the chicken fajitas pan. I checked. Twice. If you want GOOD quality, try Bayside Buffet in Mandalay Bay.  This food was bland, sad and not very tasty. The best two items I found were the grapefruit juice from the drinking stations and the Heath Bar cheesecake. But.... it just isn't worth the money."
1,"Walked right in for dinner, great waiter service, exceptional seafood! Loved the crab legs, lobster was fantastic. Good beer selection too. \n\nNice and close to the strip, prices are about what you would expect to pay for a good meal in a nice establishment in the heart of the strip."
1,"I recently had ceramic tint put on my GTI here.  The price was very fair and the quality was fantastic.  Also all of the reviews that mention the excellent customer service are spot on.  It's so good to see a business that understands how far great service and a smile can get you.  \n\nBrian even gave my daughter and I a ride to/from the mall so we would have something to do while we waited.  And we didn't have to wait long as it only took just over an hour.\n\nWhat a great company, well done!  I'll definitely recommend them to anyone needing tint."
0,After dinner this evening I was waiting outside for my husband  and I saw the door to the French Bee was opened so I decided to go in. I had been walking around the store for about 5 minutes when I here the lady behind the counter say to the other employee you go tell her we are closed. He walked over to me and said we are closed and you need to leave he also made sure to walk me out the door. I told the guy I was sorry and I walked in because the door was open. I have purchased items from this store before(at the old location) and was considering buying something tonight. I have never felt this bad after leaving a store and do not plan on buying anything else at the French Bee!! If you like rude people and overpriced items that you can make at home then this is the store for you!
1,"We don't go out for steak very often because we are invariably disappointed. Nice surprise at Cholla, great steaks and excellent staff. No big deal walking through the crappy casino. Prices were more than reasonable, especially if you are a wine drinker."
0,"Killer burger but I want to k1ll the owner! I tell the owner (joking) \"" It's my 1st time here, what's the one burger?\""  He pushes the menu at me and says \""the menu\"" then looks past me and yells \"" anyone here know what they want!?!? \""\nThe burger Nazi owns two hippies burger... He was cool after that but wow! Everything else about the experience was pure gold though! \n\nStill left a salty taste tho... ONE STAR FOR YOU! - the review nazi"
0,This place in an afterthought....\nFor such an amazing hotel it seems like they realized after they built the place that they needed to attract young Vegas.  The bar is small and the walkways even smaller.  You keep finding yourself ducking from the table service people or getting yelled at by the bouncers to get on the dance floor which by the way is smaller than most Vegas bathrooms.
1,"This place was fun it would have been better had it been maybe 3 or 4 people instead of us 2. Take your time and enjoy the good route because it is a little small! Not a crowded place at all , though I dread golfing the day it is crowded."
0,"Had high expectations of this place based on the reviews. Was deciding between Doraku and Squid Ink across the street. The wait staff was accommodating and friendly, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about this place.\n\nCons:\n1) The wait for food. It took over 30 minutes to even receive our first dish! The restaurant wasn't terribly busy and we were already really hungry. \n2) Serving portion. For about $12 / roll, the sushi portions were very meager. Expected more.\n3) Taste. The sushi was okay. Definitely had better tasting and fresher sushi before. The most disappointing item was the \""ramen\"". First, it wasn't advertised to be spicy, but it was. Secondly, this was NOT Japanese ramen. It was a pack of Korean Nong Shim Shin Ramyun that I could have bought and prepare for under $1 from an Asian market. They threw some meat inside and called it \""ramen\"". They charged $8 for this. \n\nShould have went with the other sushi place across the street."
0,"the attempt to upgrade this place from the dump of imperial palace it used to be seems to going OK.\n\ntheir cocktail waitresses are super nice and the staff is very friendly.\n\ni would never stay here but i do love the tables, always super cheap.\n\na better place than what imperial palace used to be, but still not a good option for accommodations on your trip unless you're looking for something super cheap!"
0,"This group of people are the absolute worst. If you have them I recommend ditching them, if you are thinking about it go somewhere else for service if you can.\n\nSeems as though they like our money and despise the customer. I hope google brings ISP to Phoenix area, and these guys are choked out of the market."
1,Love the bagels and smear! Don't order a sandwich to go though bc it'll take forever. Customer service is still on par though!
0,"Seriously, I had to wait too long for my food. I was starving and come on we ordered hot dogs. It shouldn't take too long to make a hot dog right? Especially if I there was no fixings on it. The hot dog was average, nothing I would come back for. I think I could make a better hot dog at home. I do have to say that I did enjoy their chili fries. I don't think the food was worth the wait or the price."
0,$5.00 for an iced tea?!  Okay - don't get me wrong - I really love tea but what started out as a simple tasting turned into a high pressure sales tactic that left me kicking myself.  I guess I should give the sales clerk for knowing how to make a sale. But when I asked her if my iced tea was caffeinated becasue I could really use some caffeine to kick start my shopping adventures.  She repleid no but you will like it anyway. Hmm - not sure that's what I was thinking 10 minutes later.
1,"Shout out to Ron that works out in the garden center,. He's got to be one of the nicest Home Depot employees.  always friendly and remembers not only who we are, but others as well.  He's a tremendous asset to our community.  Thanks Ron."

1,"This review is based on Wildhorse's wedding facilities only.  I've never played golf a day in my life.\n\nI got married at Wildhorse last year, after a friend who also got married there recommended it to me, and there are no words to explain how amazing and happy my experience was with Wildhorse.  We looked at about a dozen venues in both Southern Ca and Las Vegas/Henderson and the moment I walked into Wildhorse, I knew it was the one.  My happiness only grew after we met Elena H. (the food & beverage manager).  She is amazing, helpful, and friendly.  She was the biggest help in planning my wedding.  Our wedding day went off without a hitch and I have absolutely no complaints about anything.  The food was delicious, the venue is elegant, the greens are beautiful, the staff is friendly, everything is perfect about this place, including the cost.  It was very budget-friendly for us.  I definitely think that we got the best bang for the buck.  I really cannot put into words how incredibly happy I was with my experience at Wildhorse.  I wish I could give them 10 stars."
1,Yummy. Good for lunch for the downtown crowd. It's nice to have something that's not in the business district.
1,"I used Solis for both a mammogram and an ultrasound. The wait to be seen was not bad and they had great magazines in the waiting room. Once I was see the doctor was quite helpful. She really took the time to explain everything with me, including my options for treatment.\n\nHopefully I will not have to get another mammogram, but if I do,  this is where I would go."
0,Bad service from the hostess. She was rude and not friendly at all. Good food though.
1,"The patio is great for peolple watching and the beer is cold.  I see some here who didn't like the food, but it never crossed my mind to ever eat there.  Just drink and have a good time"
1,"On my list of Dive Bars to visit when in Las Vegas . . . and so we stopped for a quick one before heading back to our hotel.  Best part . . . I drank for free . . . because I was playing video poker.\n\nNot a bad set-up . . . but will all the glass doors . . . you get a feeling that it is kind or small.  Though we did not eat any thing, the food smelled wonderful.\n\nI will most likely be back on another trip to try this place for lunch . . . only because when I am in Las Vegas . . . I like to dinner out at nicer restaurants . . . and this place has more of that homey atmosphere."
0,"TL;DR - Depressing Cafe is Depressing (and sub par)\n\n*the tl;dr on top of a review is quite ingenious imo, anyways*\n\nI ate that this place one time before this review and I completely loved the cheese sticks but forgot everything else on the menu.\n\nSo, I convinced my roommate that Promenade Cafe was THE place to eat since I recalled all the food was so cheap and I didn't want to go to Buzz BBQ.  So let me walk through how I got to 2 stars.\n\nWe are walking in the cafe, I have good expectations at this point (5 stars).\n\nOnce taking a gander at the people at the place, I realized that the average age of cafe went from 70 to about 39, it kind of smelled like Florida.  \n\n(Still 5 stars, eff losing stars for agism)\n\n3-4 different waiters/waitresses kept coming up and asking us what we wanted to drink, it was pretty confusing after awhile. Which was odd since only 4 other people were in the facility.\n\nI ended up getting the 3 course meal for $9.99 which included cheese sticks, spaghetti and meatballs, and some berry cake.\n\nStill, 5 stars up to this point.\n\nThen our normal waitress left to go on break.\n\nThen after I got my cheese sticks (which were delicious) it took a good 20+ minutes for the main course to be served.\n\n(Hmm...losin a star here)\n\nOnce I received my food, I couldn't wait to eat it.  Clearly after the long delay of making this food, I would pretty much be eating gods nectar, right?!  Boy howdy, I have never seen anyone make extremely sub par pasta before.\n\n(Down to 3 stars)\n\nAfter leaving a bad taste, I couldn't wait for desert to come around.  Except that it was a good 30 minutes before we received our desert.  There was about 5 customers and 10 staff, how the hell? On top of that, the berry cake was pretty dry and it was just bleh.\n\n(1.5 stars).\n\nAnd to top it all off, while my roommate and I were waiting for desert.  An elderly woman walked to a table and when the waiter asked her how many people will be joining, she said in a loud and dead tone, \""I'm eating alone tonight\"".\n\n(gains a 1/2 pity star, for a total of 2 stars)\n\nHearing that was so depressing, that I couldn't even continue whatever conversation what I talking about.  It completely killed whatever positive atmosphere that was going on at the moment.\n\nI feel like cutting my wrist just thinking about this place, it's almost as depressing as Silverton Casino."
0,"If you look for the salads on the menu, there are none listed.  But rest assured, they do have a few.  Let's focus on the Caesar for a minute shall we?  Pretty standard, right?  I may be wrong, but are chili flakes standard on a Caesar?  Should I have known to ask for no chili flakes?  I'd expect to ask for no anchovies or croutons or parmesan (gasp, I would NEVER), but \""hold the chili flakes?\""  Um. NO. Sorry. I've said it before and I'll say it again, pepper of ANY kind on ANY salad should be left to the discretion of the person consuming it.  And if it's a go, it should be done to taste--their taste, not the chefs.  That is NOT the case at Lupo.  So on the off chance that I'm not in the majority, please ask them to hold the chili flakes on the caesar.  I stand firm on the fact that not everyone has a taste for pepper and because of this, Lupo will only be getting 2 stars.  I'm giving an extra for the ambience (Vegas, people-watching, etc).  And in case you were wondering--yes, I asked the waitress what was wrong with the salad and it was her who pointed out the chili flakes.  I told her it was inedible and she shrugged and said \""sorry, that's how they prepare it here.\""  She then took the full, uneaten plate away, charging me for every single uneaten piece of green and flake.  UGH!!\n\nBut the filet was good...."
0,"BE VERY CAREFUL AROUND THIS PLACE...  I had one of the bus drivers back up into my trailer and race car and then flee the scene.  Yep those people who transport everyone around did a HIT &RUN!!!  After we had a witness tell us who it was we called management to come and take care of the problem.  Over 2 hours later and multiple calls someone finally showed up but couldn't help me since they weren't in charge.  Finally over 3 hours later (The casino was within walking distance) they had someone bring me their insurance information... But now their insurance is telling me that they can't do anything till the casino contacts them to let them know which bus it was!.  So after a week of calling and leaving messages it seems like they are ignoring me and hoping the problem will go away.  If I don't get a response by the end of the week I will have to call the police to try to get this solved.     \n\nI hope no one else will have to go through what I have but if they do, get the police involved immediately!  This hotel and casino is trying to avoid fixing a problem they caused to a paying guest.   \n\nThis doesn't even mention the false charges they tried to add to my credit card after I had already checked out.  \n\nBy far the worse customer service and satisfaction I have ever received.  \n\n!!!!YOU\""VE BEEN WARNED!!!!"
0,"US Airways is by far the worst airline I have ever traveled on. I wouldn'tw fly with them again if they were going to save me a difference of $500! With two people...we ended up paying $100 round trip for baggage fees, received extremely rude service, and sat on the return flight for over an hour while they replaced a broken radio (yes, they boarded an entire flight before this was discovered). Please don't make the same mistake we did. Never choose US Airways."
1,"I honestly can't think of enough good things to say about Larry's Great Western Meats.  I have been impressed with everything I've heard, seen and now finally experience myself.  I've had friends and co-workers recommend Larry's multiple times over the years, but have always been reluctant to really give it a try.\n\nI recently found myself craving meatloaf and thought of my friend who makes amazing meatloaf.  I called him up and sure enough, his secret was simply just stopping by Larry's and picking it up.  It is already premixed with the ingredients being added when the grind the hamburger daily, so it is super fresh and always consistent.\n\nI called the store earlier in the day to inquire if they took phone orders (which they don't) but the woman assured me that even though I will be coming in right before they closed, she would ensure there would be plenty.  She took the time to ask what how or what I will be making it in, if I like it spicy and a few other questions.   I arrived about 15 minutes before they closed and when I asked about meatloaf, she immediately remembered my voice and proceeded to fill the order we discussed 8 hours earlier in the day.  Now this is nice itself, but since they were packed and busy it is impressive she kept  a phone call of a new customer and the details of the conversation.\n\nI didn't order anything else this visit, but did look and review the other meats while I was there.  The prices are much better than I expected and very competitive if not better than local major chain stores. The price of fresh ground beef (and meatloaf) was $2.49.\n\nI will come back for the great meats, but also because of the great service and prices.  I\n have found my new meat market!"
1,"You know you've got a good place when the last time you were there was at least 2 months ago and you're still a familiar face... I love the layout of this place... It's a clean space with shelving, beer and minimal knickknacks...  \n\nThe selection seems overwhelming because when you're used to seeing so much Bud Light and Michelob Ultra, I guess your senses perk up when you're in the midst of numerous craft options... And I might sound like a typical noob when I say this, but I love checking out the awesome labels and bottles... The shelved beers probably need to be chilled depending on how you get down, but if you're looking for something to taste quickly, there's coolers on one side and a bar in the back...\n\nIf you head to that bar in the back, that's where you'll find Chris with all sorts of delights on tap... He'll let you taste a little to see what you like and tell you all about it... I love the little map on the wall that shows you where the selections you're drinking are from... I'm a dork like that...\n\nOH!  Check out is really fun... It's all on an iPad and you can email your receipts to yourself... I like that... Less paper to stick in my purse... lol\n\nIf you're looking for a good time, Good Bottle is definitely the way to go..."
0,"Ok, I was trying to be adventurous for the group.  I don't really have a palate for Lebanese food, but it wasn't bad.  I am a huge fan of fatoosh salad and that was definitely a good choice.  The table ordered 4 dishes that included filet pieces and chicken pieces with rice, a ground meat concoction and a hummus appetizer.  The hummus was good.  The fillet and chicken were ok.  If I were talked into going again, I'd probably order a gyro next time."
0,"Pharmacy here is a joke! 3 days, 4 visits, talked to 8 different people...still no meds! On day 3 of dealing with this they tell me they can not even order my medication and have no way of getting it, you didn't know that 3 days ago?? They are rude, unorganized, everything takes forever and they like to blame everything on their \""system\"" not working well. The \""system\"" is not an excuse for poor service and a total lack of knowledge. When I call all I get is a recording that everyone is already on the phone, but nobody ever picks up, its an eternal hold and when you leave a message they never call back. So I have to just keep wasting my time and gas driving over there. Avoid at all costs if you, like me, actually need your medications."
0,"If I had to judge this place in less than 10 words, I would say - Disappointing Nobu knock-off that left my wallet empty.   Wow.  What a HUGE disappointment.  I came here for my birthday the other night.  After my husband dropped over $400 for 4 people (included food for 4 and 3 drinks, no dessert), I left highly dissatisfied.  I can name a dozen Japanese restaurants around the country, including mom and pop robata dives, neighborhood sushi restaurants and high end places like Nobu that do seafood and robata better than this place.  While the owner payed a lot of attention to detail when decorating this place, the same cannot be said of the food.  Everything was off.  The grilled fishes were not seasoned to perfection, the fried foods were just not crispy enough, the sushi was completely unmemorable, the drinks were mediocre, and the black cod was the worst I have ever had.  I'm happy to pay good money for an excellent food experience, but mediocre food at $$$$$ prices is just grossly annoying.   I will not return here."
0,"Like many others, I go here because there are not many options on the east side, and Sam's Town ( a solid 3 star establishment) isn't always showing what you want to see. Have to hand it to them that the theater is on one end of the building, so you don't have to walk all the way through the casino to get to it. Unfortunately there isn't really a whole lot of parking convenient to the entrance (am I the only one who has noticed that the State of Nevada has issued handicapped placards to EVERYONE)? There used to be valet service at that door, but it disappeared along with the rest of their customer service long ago.\n\nSo, you have to tack an extra 15 minutes on to your trip so you don't miss the previews, which, as we all know, are the best part. \nOn the other hand, don't hurry down, as we did, to make it to a showing that starts before 5 to get the slightly more reasonable matinee prices. No matinee rates on the weekend. Seriously?\n\nIn addition, we got into the (horrifically overpriced) concession line with only one party ahead of us, but it seemed to be a complicated transaction because the other line managed to serve 4 groups before the befuddled teenager in ours finally figured it out. Don't know which of the kids was supposed to be in charge of popcorn, but they were all out and BG had to go back and pick it up (at least it was hot and fresh). \n\nThe theater was adequate if not great, but we were disturbed a couple of times by youngsters chasing each other up the aisles. Where are the Nazi-trained ushers of my youth, standing with arms crossed and jaws clenched, ready to take out the frustration of their miserable circumstances on any intrepid hooligan who dared step out of line? Better yet, where were their parents? Probably at the Galaxy, which is where I'm going next time no matter what."
0,"Its ok.  We ended up with reservations here because Onda was closed during our visit.  (Booooo)  I wasn't really impressed with the food.  It wasn't poor quality it just wasn't good Italian food.  I have pretty high standards for Italian food (I'm from NY and have many many Italian family members and friends) and it takes a lot to impress me.  The service was great, the location in the Venetian is great too.  There happened to be a lot of weddings when we were there so we got to watch them doing all their pictures which was fun for my friend and I.  (I dont' think our husbands were that interested though....)  I was, however,  impressed with the diversity of champagnes and sparkling wines on their menu.    There are just so many options in Vegas I don't think we'll return here anytime soon."
0,"Generic breakfast menu in a generic atmosphere attempting to impersonate a French country cabin.\n\nFor breakfast, Mimi's Cafe offers what is essentially a diner menu with some upscale dishes (quiche, variety of baked goods).  Nothing's awful here, but nothing I've had off the menu is particularly inspired or interesting.  The egg dishes are well-prepared and the sausage was good enough, but there's not much seasoning--nothing to distinguish the breakfast dishes from any diner in any city.\n\nBottom line: there's a lot better breakfast in this city, but I guess you could do a lot worse."
0,"Ok so after going here a few times, the owner is very short with me. he hurt me bad, ripped off one of my thumb nails, told me that i couldn't just get a pink and white fill i had to take them off and pay 50 for a full set of glitter tips with acrylic on them. COMMON you know thats messed up. go to other places, for nails. pedicures are spot on. ask for jenny."
0,"I took my 2 kids, age 1 and 3.  At the beginning we waited to get into the movie in a holding area, several people pushed by us and we had to wait for the next movie, the person working did nothing.\n\nThe movie was not good for small kids.  Mine were scared and my 1 year old cried the whole time.  I wish we could have skipped it.\n\nThe displays were nice but nothing unique.  My 3 year old was excited to se the \""big shark\"" that they had in the picture but the sharks were only about a foot long?!?  There was a petting area but older kids and even a adults were pushing my little kids around.  Again, the person working didn't care and being  the one to encourage everyone to take turns was exhausting so we didn't spend much time at the exhibit that would have been interesting to my kids.  The rest was just fish. We could see the same thing at a seafood restaurant or someone's home.  \n\nIt is a series of ordinary aquariums.  They are well organized.  There is information available on each on a computer touchscreen, these were too high for my kids to reach.  Everything that we saw was very clean.\n\nI stretched it out as long as I could and it barely took 45 min.\n\nYou have to exit through the gift shop which I understand but is difficult with little kids not only because I have to explain why we can't buy everything but because it is cluttered and difficult to get through.\n\nI got a season pass since we are local.  Supposedly there are bring a friend days  and special exhibits that are only for season pass holders but I wasn't able to get info on either of those benefits online or at the aquarium.  We have only gone once, I've offered it to my older child several times and she says it was \""not fun\"" and she would rather go to the (free) play area at the mall.\n\nFor me, with small kids, this was not worth the money at all.   We did not enjoy it."
0,This is your standard Mexican restaurant serving a standard American audience. It is extremely cheap given it is in an off the strip casino.\n\nThere really isn't any reason to eat here unless you are at the Tuscany and do not want to travel anywhere else for food.
0,"OMG, what brain dead, Kardashian follower, thinks that this place is a good idea?\nWe went there on at Saturday night (9/6) and thankfully we were admitted because we had ticket stubs to a show at the Rio.\nIf you pay the $20- $30 charge to get into the Voodoo Club, then you truly are the idiot of the night.\nI would not have paid cover to get in here, but we decided to check it out.\nAll premium spaces in club, including the best views of the strip and any tables, were roped off. I guess you need to pay another $20 or $30 to get a good seat/view.\ni ordered a mixed drink and a beer from the bar and he charged me $24! \nWhat a colossal rip.

They were adequately staffed and the employees were pleasant."
0,"Remember when East Towne mall was nothing?  A big building full of emptiness, speckled with a few pathetic stores here and there?  Ten to 15 years later, and now its been completely revamped and is all dolled up with white twinkly lights, and cheesy holiday decorations.  Hell, even Santa shows up there now.  \n\nBut guess what?  You can't just walk around the mall without some dipstick wanting you to try on their lotion or straighten your hair for you!!!  Isn't that exciting?  It's like being harassed by a car salesperson, only these people want to let you know how ugly you are, and how they can improve you with their shit products.  \n\nDo you want to try this wonderful lotion?  Can I straighten your hair for you?  Can I ask you a question about your skin??!  Can I ruin this trip to the mall for you by refusing to leave you alone every time you walk by?!?!  \n\nYES!!!!  It's like getting a root canal and then asking for a do over.  Because, even if you politely say no thank you, they persist, and harass, and then as you are walking away, you hear them say snide little things about you.    \n\nI hate those pushy bastards.  They ruin every, single trip to the mall."
0,"Well i hate to be the bearer of bad news...but these doughnuts are average at best. My co-workers bring some in to work about twice a week and each time they taste the same to me. The doughnuts have to much dough so to speak...and quite frankly they are really to big to enjoy as a doughnut. The last time i checked doughnuts should be a joy to eat...not a chore. I think i will stick to my Krispy Cremes if you don't mind my fellow yelpers. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!"
1,"I don't know the whole history of this restaurant but some co-workers introduced me to it. It has good prices and good food.  Good lunch specials - we call ahead and pick up or eat there. Lunch service is usually pretty fast in our experience. I especially like the eggrolls/springrolls which taste a lot like some homemade Filipino \""lumpias\"" my aunts make."
0,this used to be my FAVORITE buffet a couple years ago. This buffet was supposed to be one of the highlights of my trip and it turned out to be okay. I wish i had spent my time eating somewhere else. Things that changed from the last time i was here:\n\n-less variety both desserts and regular food\n-desserts were bland minus the creme brulee \n-no rack of lamb (i was told its only on friday and saturday)\n-no ceviche \n\noverall this felt like it was work $20/pp not $40
1,"Arrived 8:10am on a Monday. Waited 6 minutes and boom, I was called up. Unbelievably short wait! In LA, I would have to wait at least 15 minutes just to get a number, and then wait another 30-45 to get called. \n\nNo line to get a number and a six minute wait to get called. AMAZING.\n\nThe rep was not very friendly but effective. \n\nHad to pay a crap load to register my car but the cool part was that you're able to buy special license plates (for a pricey $60 more). I bought the Susan Komen one--if you're going to spend more, might as well stretch that dollar to donate. \n\nFour stars. \n\nFive stars for fast service\nFive stars for helpfulness (answering all my questions)\nFour stars for friendliness (smiling helps)\nFive stars for parking spaces"

0,Was there August 30th 2014 for the Xposed Beach Party so will only review that-did NOT stay there.  Thank goodness got on the list and arrived before 1pm so we didn't have to pay.  It would not be worth the cover charge.  And unless you pay top dollar for some cabana or beds there is hardly anywhere to sit/lay down.  Mid-afternoon the largest bar to right of entrance just closed down!  Supposedly something about the health department shutting it down.  Hmmmm  So that left 1 bar outside for all the guys and gals that were there.  Insane!!!!  Only plus for me was looking at the gorgeous Xposed pool boy that was going around taking everybody's picture with the frame.
1,I LOVE this pizza!  It's the best I have had in Phoenix.  Not the greatest atmosphere to sit down in.  Service is fine... but the pizza is awesome.

0,"Place was interesting. The decor reminds you of \""cheers\"" because of the wood. I had a salmon wrap and it was very good. It had a mustard sauce and came with fries. Prices were decent. Our waitress lacked personality and her breath smelled bad, but she got everything.food wise right. It took awhile to bring our drinks. I split the check with my friend, and she didn't divide the items correctly.I probably wouldn't come here again because it wasn't \""special\"". If I'm coming all the way from Monroeville, then I want more bang for my buck."
0,"I was so disappointed with my Monsoon visit. While prices seemed fair I felt the food was lacking. I called in a to-go order that was ready quickly. No complaints there.\n\nWe sampled the fresh rolls. It must have been a bad day for their shrimp order because these did not live up to their namesake. They were huge and to my dismay actually tasted kinda rotten. The peanut sauce paled in comparison to the sauce served at Doan's.\n\nAlso sampled was the Tom Yum soup. It had large chunks of tough lemongrass and no subtle flavors or really any flavors.\n\nWe enjoyed the old stand by Kang Panang Curry: Panang curry in coconut cream with peas, carrots, bell peppers, chopped lime leaves and sweet basil.\n\nI wouldn't go back just for that though when other restaurants are the total package."
1,"The food here is excellent and I love going there. The only problem I seem to always have is with the kid's menu. I realize this is a mexican place, but my daughter will only eat chicken fingers and fries when we're there. The fries are always undercooked and greasy and the last time, the fryer was closed down.  I got her a plain chicken taco. Basically, she had no dinner that night. \nThe staff is always super friendly and I want to eat there every day, but the kids options can be a little tricky."

0,"Clean and spacious arrangement, however, customer service is VERY poor here. Was promised pant alternations would be done by certain time but when called they were still working on them. Was leaving on extended trip and wanted to have the pants so rushed in a few hours later to pick up. Since this was now very close to my departure, I was in a huge hurry. Had already paid so literally just needed to be handed my pants and on my way. However, with two guys working both were busy and did not even acknowledge my presence as  I stood there and circled around for 10 minutes. Not a peep. No \""will be right with you\"" or anything. Finally grabbed one guy off of phone and got my pants and was out of there. But after this experience I would NEVER shop at Jos A Bank's again. I'm used to \""Nordstrom\"" (and independent clothier) customer service. And this was far, far from it. Very unprofessional!"
0,"Attended a week long family reunion here for remembrance of my father who passed away.  Our plans were to enjoy the pool and lazy river, share meals in our room, and split up at times to pursue local and far away attractions as smaller groups. For the most part the place is OK, and I'll try to be concise, but please read on for a summary of safety concerns/risk management.\n\nPROS\n- service staff friendly and accommodating\n- pool and grounds pleasant and charming (in a cheesy but cool way)\n- clean\n- onsite Denny's convenient for quick meals\n- communal bbq area well set up (if you don't mind communal)\n- evening poolside movie for families was neat\n\nMIXED FEELINGS\n- scantily clad \""hotties\"" serving drinks poolside, I mean, it's Vegas and all, but a bit more than I'd say \""OK\"" to with kids around\n- poolside music pretty loud over the weekend (plugging ears on that side of lazy river every time we passed by), was much more pleasant and low-key mid week\n\nCONS\n- No WIFI in rooms, had to go to 10th floor \""lounge\"" for internet access, and was booted out one evening due to \""private engagement\"" set up while I was uploading pictures. I understand the need to generate funds, but the limited amount of internet access should be available at all times...or...why not in-room like other places?\n- Mora room definitely cave-like and pull out bed really only good for kids due to limited privacy.  OK for quick weekend stays, but wouldn't want to spend a week+ in there again.\n- Kids in pool very rowdy and not reeled in by lifeguards or staff. One 14 yr-old-ish bully kept whacking the water on the surface with a flotation noodle in order to intimidate younger kids around him.  Many kids, including my 7 yr old daughter, were terrified.  Worse, this prompted other kids to start doing the same.  While not more horrible than the classic towel snap, I considered it a safety issue since it was so close to kids faces, and since I do not condone bullying.  This got so carried away that myself and several other folks and kids got out of the pool.  I mean, where's the parents, but also, where the lifeguards?  I held out as long as I could assuming someone would say something, but no one did.  The lifeguards sat around apathetic to the cause.\n- My biggest beef: My 76 yr old mom had an accident while exiting the pool and opened up a 3\"" long, deep laceration in her shin (to the bone). Due to her age and health issues, this was a serious injury. I (extensively trained in first aid) provided initial assessment and stabilization of my mom and the scene, then called the lifeguard, who blew a whistle in the direction of the towel shack.  A girl came over, and i explained the situation and asked her what their protocol was in this accident situation.  She gave me a dumb look, shrugged her shoulders, and I said \""Hey, we're tourists here, I don't know where the medical facilities are, and she clearly needs stitches\"".  She disappeared.  At this point, security came over and started asking simple questions and tried to talk us out of calling 911 saying \""she doesn't need stitches\"".  At this point I instructed my sister to call 911.  With no other resort staff presence or response, I provided continued first aid on my mom to control bleeding and comfort my mom until the EMT's showed up. Eventually, staff showed up with a bag of ice, and a 4\"" sterile dressing.  Like, what am i supposed to do with this?....she has an open and deep laceration, so ice is useless, and with no bandage material, so is a dressing. Luckily, the EMTs promptly showed up, and I turned my mom over to them.  the only other staff response was the same dumb girl came back with gloves on for the bio-hazards materials, and the security guy asked for our names and a \""statement\"". \n\nThe good side of the story is my mom required 20 stitches but is fine.  The bad side of the story is that i feel Tahiti Village showed no organised incident response procedures, no basic first aid abilities, and a strong desire to cover their own asses by down-playing my mom's situation and asking for \""statements\"" in the heat of the moment.  Coupled with my other poolside safety concerns here, along with full access to liquor at the pool, leads me to have strong concerns over risk management and incident response at this resort.  Use extreme caution and judgement on pool/lazy river use, because you are apparently on your own if something comes up.  What if i didn't have first aid skills (which includes accident assessment and action plan components)? What if we didn't call 911?  We even asked where the local hospital was and they had no answer for me!\n\nWhile Tahiti Village was an OK place otherwise, and would have gotten 3 stars from me, the lack of incident managements plans and training leaves me with a sour taste of what's likely a small window into the much bigger picture of this resort in general. Use with caution."
1,"went here by recommendation of my dearest friend on 13 years. I needed a 2nd opinion and i got exactly what I needed. I will be having surgery soon and will continue my review then.\n\nfor now Dr. craddock was very caring, listened to me. asked appropriate questions and took everything I said into consideration. update to come soon"
1,"I give this spa a 5. It's big, it's clean. And beautiful. I purchased a day pass because that's all the time I had. My sister and I spent 3 hours there -  hopping between hot spring, warm spring, cold spring, sauna, and steam room. Meanwhile, ample supply of fresh fruit, fruit juice, coffee, tea, and ice water. When we got tired, we read, chatted, and watched TV on iPad. 3-hours went by quickly.\n\nThere will be repeated visits to this place in the near future."
0,"Over priced food! Service was great! Milk shake was amazing! Curly fries were luke warm like they had been sitting around for awhile. The burger was exactly as described, but not special at all. The I-80 was rather bland."
1,Dr. Matt Paige is the best. His adjustments & neuro-emotional therapy has done wonders for me!
0,"Can driver just finished his 5 minute rant about how we are inconveniencing him by making him go North rather than South...and how we didn't signal him correctly. Ummm...sorry?!?!? \nCrazy bad service, rude driver, nonsense."
1,Favorite place to stop after hiking Camelback!  I love this tiny little place on Scottsdale.  Its the best spot to grab a quick bit to eat or some coffee.  The breakfast sandwich is the best!  I love that several of the items on the menu are vegetarian or gluten free.  The staff are always the friendliest people around.  I'm hooked on this place!
1,"There's something about sitting and enjoying your sub at Firehouse that makes you want to smile. \n\nWhen you walk in, the entire staff looks like they just finished laughing at some great joke and they keep that jolly disposition the entire time.\n\nAs for the subs - steaming the meat and cheese works well. The bun never suffers the fate of heat or toasting and stays soft and fresh down to the last bite.\n\nAs far as subs go, Firehouse fits me just perfectly."
1,"Bit overpriced, but daaaaamn good fish and eel.  Eel is a tough thing to rock out at, as there is the eel, and the cooking, and the sauce.  Lots of oxidized-tasting sauce out there, but this was perfect.\n\nChic lighting and decor; an army of chefs.  If you like sake (or want to try it), the servers really know the sake menu and can find you something you want at a price you can afford.  You might get a bonus history lesson too."
0,"Short story: Very \""Americanized\"" Mexican food at higher than necessary prices. Watery so so salsa, but the chips were fresh and good. We made the mistake of parking on the side by the dumpsters: Avoid that mistake, they smell terrible! And is it just me but when the employees use the general bathroom in the front of the restaurant is that kind of weird? Going in to use the bathroom I was passed by a cook on the way in and waiter on the way out. Maybe it's just me. For the food: The fish taco is not recommended, fishy and bland. The beef taco, I did think was good. Sorry I didn't find more to like!"
1,"One of my favorite spots in Vegas. I have had several great meals here. The Sommelier was fantastic, friendly and made some really great pairings. If you'd like a tasty fun cocktail, try their cable car. Again, Michael Mina can do no wrong by me."
1,"First time here. Ordered the Mexican tacos: chorizo and carnitas. Wife had the verde chicken enchiladas. Very good chips and salsa and they also brought out a small chicken, rice, cilantro soup with the chips for free that was very delicious!  Very good service, and nice staff.  \n\nAll of the food was very good quality and fresh tasting.  This is now one of my 2 top places in Madison for tacos!"
1,Followed Yelp Reviews To Yama on our most recent trip out from LA.  \n\nSolid! Thoroughly enjoyed our first experience here.  Arrived at 530. Waited 20 min. Finished By 7. Line was about 40 people deep! \n\nMost of the fish was fresh.  Only the halibut tasted a bit fishy. Uni was a tad gooey but tasted fine. \n\nWe'll be back for sure!
0,"Check in to Howard Johnson and the rooms are pretty decent. However, the water through the entire building got shut off due to broken pipes and we haven't been able to use the restroom or shower for the last three hours. Really disappointed!"
1,"For our birthdays, my parents treated me and my husband out to Famous Dave's. Our waitress, Brenda, was really good and friendly and I could have sworn she'd been a waiter for a long time but she told us that it was her first week. Nevertheless, she knew the entire menu and answered my mom's questions about the garbage can platter. \n\nLet me say that the ribs are seriously meaty!!! About an inch thick from the bone. I love all the choices in the barbeque sauces. Their coleslaw is super creamy (I don't think it has onions in it, hey, not everyone can eat onions). The pork and beans were warm and not from a can. Afterwards, they brought out ice cream for us on account of our birthdays and the cool part is they bring it out with a sparkling Roman candle on the plate; it's quite a sight. \n\nOnly dinged them one star for a few MINOR reasons. The platter is just too much meat. It's almost nothing BUT meat. It'd be great if they mixed it up and replaced those huge chicken breasts with more of those carrot sticks (we only got two for four people), and maybe with onion rings or mustard potato salad. The corn muffins are NOT good at all. They taste like cardboard. \n\nOn a quick note, the little drawing that the waitress is forced to draw on the plate is useless. It's trivial and the plate just takes up more room on an already cramped table."
1,"So.... I have an affinity for Louisiana as my oldest child was born at Women's Hospital in Baton Rouge. Actually, one of the first to be born 19 years ago at that hospital. I love the laid back atmosphere and the aroma. I was there for an event upstairs. There was no air conditioning, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I didn't want to experience the humidity of Baton Rouge in August, but all the rest of the two-story-plantation-like ambiance I wanted! As a rule I NEVER stay for dinner at networking events. Well, I did last night and I'm glad I did. The service and the food were excellent. The char-grilled chicken with the rice and veggies were so delish! My companion had blackened chicken that was also very good. The hush puppies and rolls were to frick frackin die for. I had to control myself or I wouldn't have enough room for din din. Being Italian-Lebanese I am a huge bread eater. Our server Robert was attentive, knowledgeable and a plethora of information on just about anything we asked. I had a very good time! But I was MELTING. Fix the air!! If I don't have a good hair day and I am sweating like a ho in church...... it's not good. Would I go again? Absolutely! When the air is on...."
0,"Okay food, semi-rude service. \n\nWe stopped in for a late dinner (~9.45pm) and the waiter happily welcomed us in. The food was alright, nothing special but not terrible either. Then, at 10.30pm, just as we were finishing our drinks, they turned the music off and turned on the lights - it was a strange way to basically kick us out, even though we had paid and were about to leave! 45 mins-an hour for dinner is not overly lengthy - if they didn't want to stay open, they could have simply said when we walked in the door."
0,"After sending a letter to the hotel complaining about my awful experience they send me a letter apologizing and to show their generosity they offered me a free upgrade next time I stay in one of their bungalow suites... \n\nas sarah palin said re: the \""bridge to nowhere\"": Thanks but no thanks.\n\none extra star for sending a letter instead of just ignoring me :P"
0,"Update: It is 6 months later. The refund in question never arrived. Tried calling again, but was met with the same extremely long wait times and unnavigable phone-trees. It wasn't worth the time and energy, and just gave up. The only recourse is to do everything possible to avoid taking the Greyhound NYC / MTL and Boston / MTL routes-- challenging, considering Greyhound maintains a monopoly there. One hopes that a better service will arise sooner rather than later."
1,"located in treasure island - a great place for dinner before the 7pm mystere show because they open at 4:30pm.  started off with a pitcher of margaritas.. done right!  the guacamole was fresh and tasty.   all of us had the fajitas (2 veggie and 2 chicken) and loved them!  i had the vegetarian fajitas - bell peppers, onions, and other veggies.  got them \""alambre style\"", which is topped with melted cojita cheese.. so good and worth it!   the best thing, by far, was the kahlua creme brulee!  don't pass it up!  all in all, a good dinner and conveniently located a few steps away from the mystere theatre!"
1,"Ja nun was soll ich sagen. Die Steakts TOP 1a, First Class, (daf\u00fcr 4 Punkte) aber das Ambiente h\u00e4tte dringend mal eine renovierung oder Aufwertung notwendig. Ich bin ja ein begeisterter Steakesser aber ich finde das Lokal mittlwrweile langweilig (das ist hier nur ein Punkt wert) geht es anderen ebenso?"
1,"I had an opportunity to hit this place up on a Saturday evening... There was some decent band playing some of that modern style hard rock that has periods of slow stuff that is radio friendly... Or maybe they do it so  that some chicks will show up.  Anyhow, this isn't a review of the band it is a review of the bar... \n\nI actually dug this place, interesting set up, themed like a (who guessed it...) beauty parlor... with those hairdryer things and manicure tables and all the usual stuff you find at a salon, but with the addition of booze!  Well, maybe the place you go to get your hair cut serves booze, but mine doesn't...  They offer a full bar and if you aren't interested in imbibing some delicious alcohol then you are also able to order yourself a 24oz PBR (that is Pabst Blue Ribbon for those of you who don't know, and in the words of Biggy: If you don't know, now you know...)\n\nRight, so I sampled the Jack n' Coke, and considering that in this bar I saw 2 Hells Angels (real deal... sporting colors) and everyone else had about 2 square feet of tattooage all over there body I will rate the Jack n' Coke as weak.  It was right up there with the measured Jack n' Cokes you get at professional sports venues...  Anyhow, probably for the best considering the clientele... \n\nFor reference 3 mixed drinks and a Bud Light (can) cost $24, so bring a flask and top off you drink... Either that or venture into the 24oz PBR world, I can't imagine those cost more than $2, but then again this is Vegas you aren't trying to save money... and if you are a local then you don't need me to tell you how to party...\n\n4 Stars for the setup\n-1 Star for the weak drink\n+1 Star for having Hells Angels and hot tatooed chicks (I better give them a star if I know whats good for me...)"
1,"I love going to Adele! I currently have a pixie cut and when I came to her the very first time after a move from Oregon, she asked a lot of questions to get to know my hair and what I wanted, and played with it for a few minutes. Then she started cutting away. After she thought she was almost done, she had me run my hands through my hair to make sure it \""felt\"" right to me and if I wanted any areas shorter and/or thinned out. After a few tweaks, it was perfect; exactly what I wanted. I'm happy and confident that whenever I go see Adele, I'll come out looking fantastic and happy with my cut and style. I also love she does complimentary neck and bang trims as needed between cuts."
0,It took my hair 2 hairstylists and 2 years after the botch job from the female manager  at this place.They ever had the color pouring into my ears and were annoyed when I was alarmed.Thank goodness I ran from there and have a great person now.Stay away !!!! Note I have been to Sassoon in 2 other cities with great results.
1,Super cute interior and very friendly staff. Brandi made me the most delicious chai tea. Lots of cinnamon.
0,"Came a long way to see this place. Was in town for a mini vacation with co workers and I brought my husband. His main goal was to visit this place. He WAS a huge fan. \n\n1.) Waited in line an hour. Got there around 930am. \n\n2.) Once inside, several unfamiliar faces stood behind the counters. The place is very, very small. The merchandise is ridiculously overpriced, and the overpriced, mostly- Chumlee souvenirs fills up more than one-third of the small store. \n\n3.) Of course, we asked where the Pawn Stars guys were and we were told they were in the back offices of the store because they had just finished filming a segment. (ok....resting up from WHAT exactly??) \n\n4.) After 20 mins, we were told that the guys were going to be filming another segment in 10 mins so we (their FANS) would have to wait outside again. During this 10 mins, the producers handpicked a handful of stand-in customers, had therm sign releases, then instructed the rest of us to leave the building. \n\n4.) My husband quietly told a male staff member that this was a big disappointment. The male staff member's reply: \""Well, it's a lot like sex; not everyone is going to enjoy it.\"" (Insightful...?) \n\n5.) At no time did we catch even a slight glimpse of the 4 reality, borderline (and temporary) \""celebrities\"". One male employee said the reason they don't come out to visit with fans is because people would be  too busy trying to get autographs and pics rather than buying merchandise. \n\n* Their \""merchandise\"" including the souvenirs are insanely overpriced. Customers may be more apt to buy this stuff from one of the guys they enjoy watching on tv rather than from friendly but unfamiliar faces who appear to snarl whenever fans ask \""Where are they???\"" -- which is pretty often. \n\n* Two words: Fan Appreciation. Their shop is mediocre compared to other pawn shops in Vegas, the neighborhood is lousy, and their stuff is too overpriced. By some strange twist of fate, this place was selected for fame. And the fame exists only because of their fans. \n\n* Reality shows are created every day. Pawn Stars' 15 minutes of fame is nothing but a brief glimmer in the pan. It won't last forever. And when it's over, hopefully the courtesy and appreciation these guys showed their fans is remembered and reciprocated."

1,"How can I not have rated OHSO?!\n\nI have been here several times, but only on the back patio. Its where I find myself people watching and drinking beers. I have had some of their food and it's OK, I should try this place out for dinner sometime.. but so far my rating is all about brews, clientele, atmosphere and service. \n\nThe positive. \nTo tell you the truth, I like it - all of it. I feel relaxed here and I enjoy a place where you can sit down and just unwind over good conversation, because it isn't obnoxiously loud here. It is like a patio should be. The beer is tasty, and there is a feelgood vibe on this dog friendly patio. \n\nFunny story.\nI sat here with some veterans and enjoyed a Friday afternoon as the sun went down. When I was paying my bill I realized that the waitress had charged me for a drink to little. I told her about it, and she replied with \""Sorry, consider it military discount\"" and a smile. Needless to say I tipped her well. \n\nThe negative.\nThe men's room has one toilet and one urinal. This means that there will be a line on occasion. Another thing, that other awesome yelpers have said before me, is that I don't like valet parking. I don't. \n\nIn Summary -  it's a pleasurable visit. I would take out-of-towners here for a light meal and drinks before going somewhere else. Not saying that this place dies down as the night progresses, I just don't have that knowledge. If you haven't tried it out, please do."
0,"Bleeeeh.  Desperate to escape from the dinner at my hotel bar yet again, I opted for...dinner at a different hotel bar!  I was lured by \""brasserie\"" and \""wine bar\"".   If you're following along, you know that I should really know better.  \n\nI learned an interested factedote today--PA liquor laws force restaurants to buy wine at the same price that it retails.   That might explain the wackadoo pricing all over town, and especially at this place.   I'm getting incredibly sick of places that call themselves \""wine bars\"" that serve Mark West Pinot Noir, Sterling Merlot and Chateau St. Michelle Chardonnay.  Not all of these suck, but not exactly what one looks for in a wine bar.  \n\nThe food.  Why call yourself a \""brasserie\"" if you're serving average american hotel food?  My \""pan roasted chicken served over fresh pasta\"" was a big old bowl of fettucine alfredo with chicken hunks and some artichoke hearts and mushrooms thrown in for flavor.  \n\nThe blowhard next to me, talking at me, made me flee with the check as soon as I could."
1,"I have delivery-ordered a Veggie Pizza (with spinach and sausage) from Happy's Pizza on three occasions within the past few months over your mainstream pizza joints, such as Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, Dominos, etc due to the fact I enjoyed my Veggie Pizza (with spinach and sausage)! \n\nEvery time I have ordered a Veggie pizza from other places, I usually complain how there is not enough veggies (what can I say? I love my veggies!) but Happy's Pizza has proven to be different. From the three occasions I have ordered my pizza, it never fails - FRESH veggies are overflowing on top of each other! \n\nI should try other dishes to give it more reviews, but what can I say? When I'm in the mood for pizza, I call Happy's!"
0,The food made me sick and throw up and the show dragged a lot
0,"Could not have been more disappointed, We stayed for 3 nights, and the room was only cleaned after I called and complained for the third time. Don't bother using the service room button, the poor maid that came and cleaned the room at 12 am said the morning housekeeping mgr only wants the rooms that are for new arrivals cleaned. Also heard that they have 16 maids to clean all the rooms in the Hotel. \n\n       Valet was also horrible unless you don't mind hearing the squeeling of tires in the parking garage only to see your new 50k truck come rolling out right after. The bad thing is you have no choice but to use it because there is no self parking. After witnessing my truck being driven like that , I parked at the Aria and walked to the hotel. Don't bother complaining to the shift mgr because they could care less.\n\n      Its really to bad, because the hotel is convient and the rooms are really nice. The fridge is useless and the blackout shades have gaps in them."
1,"Ok, so you read the other reviews and maybe you think I am just being a lemming.  No, I think this very non-descript place has it going in the taste and authenticity departments.  Today at lunch was my 2nd visit as I was torn between my satisfaction at Ping Pong Thai down further on Sunset and this place.   \nSo today I had their chicken satay app, papaya salad Lao/Thai style and then the awesome green tea steamed buns!  Yes, they had them today!   \nThe satay app is rather hearty.  5 skewers of marinated grilled chicken served with the traditional peanut sauce and a small refreshing cucumber salad.\nIt was very good and I used the peanut sauce sparingly;  just enough for added flavor. \n\nTheir payaya salad blew away Ping Pong's version.   They grate the payaya just slightly larger so it has great texture and crunch.   Instead of tomato slivers they use halved baby roma tomatoes which explode with tomato-y flavor.  They cut the long beans just large enough so you know they are beans.  The dressing is very light, non-oily and you can order your heat accordingly.   Loved it!\n\nI ended with the steamed green buns.  They are little pillows of deliciousness!   HINT: Order the steamed buns when you order your food because they come to your table freshly steamed so the interior green tea filling needs time to cool a bit otherwise you might get molten filling tongue burn...Ouch!    The buns are about 2.5 inches in diameter and are soft and fluffy.   The filling is just slightly sweet and redolent of green tea aroma and taste.   These tasty treats are so deceptively good that you could easily eat 6 and never know it, so I limited myself to 2.  \n\nI say if you want to try some authentic Thai food in an unpretentious clean little place do come here."
1,"Please give this place a try when you're making your next stop at Pita Jungle. This restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked. We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed. Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice. The interior and atmosphere are great. Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar.\n\nAn Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. That's the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking.\n\nFor our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. I've never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly.\n\nFor an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best we've had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.\n\nSo in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is. The current name makes it sound like just another Middle Eastern restaurant, which it definitely is not."
0,"Over priced and just an ok beer selection.  $14 for a fajita that can feed a small child. Burger is ok, frys are cooked not all the way through."
1,"I had a wonderful dining experience here last evening. Staff is really friendly and helpful. They have a lot of vegetarian options, and most everything else on the menu can be converted to a vegan or vegetarian dish. Food is pretty good."
1,"This is our third vehicle. The sales process is awesome. Our salesperson Susanne, and our financing person Suzanne made this a painless enjoyable process. \nWe even traded in our last Carmax purchase and they have us better than fair value to our pleasant surprise. \nWill have returned and will return again."
1,"Great service and outstanding tempura scallop roll paired with some Miso soup and a large, fresh salad.  All for under $20. I'll be back."
1,"So finger lickin' good. \n\nThe epitome of my dining experience here was not only watching myself and my friends devour the whole menu but the finale to the great dinner began at the restroom's line to wash my hands.. \n\nTwo minutes into my wait in line, the young gentlewoman in front of me helped triple confirmed how delicious this place was when I struggled to keep myself from awkwardly admiring her as she licked her fingers clean. Classy woman was ~5 feet away from the restroom and probably only had to wait another minute for her turn at the sink. \n\nWell, ain't no body got time to wash your 'Hot N Juicy' fingers at the sink when you're here!\n\nStay classy and put your cool bib on before you get your sanitized hands on what we ordered:\n\n-As many lbs of shrimps you can handle\n-Dozens of fresh oysters\n-Sausages\n-Sweet potato fries\n-Fried cat fish\n-Calamari\n-Fried chicken wings!\n-Beers for the whole party\n\nWe also ordered the crawfish but I'm not a big fan of working so much for a little piece of meat. I did have a couple and it wasn't very impressive so it'd be my last recommendation to order. Spicy here is truly spicy - you'll get the heads up before ordering as well!\n\nAlso, be mindful not to ask for the 'whole-shebang' here or you'll get some Hot N Juicy stares from the waiters/waitresses. Just kidding, you'll just get kindly reminded that you're not at Boiling Crab and it's crowned the \""Hot and Juicy Special\"" sauce here - could've been more saucily creative than that methinks but the taste is very up to par."
1,"Thanks to Hurricane Sandy my husband and I found ourselves in Phoenix, Arizona for an indefinite amount of time rather than home after a two week trip in Vancouver.  Through the magic of the internet we found Hotel Tempe, an affordable lodging accommodation with great amenities and a zero cancelation fee. \n\nOnly a short drive from the airport, Hotel Tempe is close offers a free shuttle service and is within walking distance of several restaurants and the Arizona Mills Mall which includes a movie theater and an aquarium. The hotel staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms spacious and clean. We made good use of the public washer and dryer, the free Wi-Fi, and the free local phone calls. We relaxed in the outdoor hot tub and swimming pool, indulged in the complimentary happy hour, and enjoyed the vast options on the free breakfast buffet. \n\nThis place is pretty close to perfect for an inexpensive get away. Should we ever come to Phoenix again we definitely plan on staying here."
1,"We had a really wonderful dinner here....and not only because our waiter could easily have been a model... he was lovely and sadly I've already forgotten his name. I digress... \n\nWhile I was in town for a conference we heard this place was awesome. On a side note, the bathroom is super cool... We ate out on the patio & they are so nice they even set down cloth napkins for us to set our purses on (is this an out west thing?) Anyhow, we all ordered various specialty drinks and we were all pleased with out choices. We started off with the quac, which they make table side. It was delicious and the chips were also good. The quac is spicy because they do put jalapenos in it if you like (which we did!). I had Mahi tacos because after the quac and late lunch I wasn't particularly starving. The tacos were delicious. If you are starving, this would probably not be enough food for you, but perfect for a light meal. My dining companions were also pleased with their meals. The service was great and we never felt rushed or hurried, and they had just the right amount of attentiveness. I would eat here again if I ever roll through town again."
1,I love scrapbooking and this is my favorite scrapbooking store! The first time I went in I was so overwhelmed by everything they had. They have an entire room of rows and rows of paper. They have tons of ribbons and they sell fabric. \n\nAnytime I need any scrapbooking supplies I come here.
1,Good food and good service. Indoor was a bit dark
0,"Went to dinner there last night. Our server Zach was awesome. The other server in our area was mr social and found his extended conversing loud and irritating. The food was lacking. My husband had steak which was tough, not a prime cut by any means. I had the braised tenderloin pasta which came out barely warm, beef was mushy, and peppers were completely raw. Very disappointing."
0,"What can I say about Arlequino's? I'm a Montreal ex-pat living in Ottawa, but I always return home for my birthday to celebrate with friends from Montreal. From a distance, and through some searching I came upon this lovely sounding restaurant and booked it for my group of 16. Unfortunately this turned out to be a mistake of epic proportions. Let's follow the night in order of events.\n\nDrink orders:\nOne of my friends suggested we split a bottle of wine, a suggestion I liked, but neither of us are really wine connoisseurs. We asked the waitress for some suggestions, letting her know that we both preferred sweeter white wines, but she didn't know anything about the wine menu, \""I don't really drink wine\"" was her response. We asked her if anyone there knew, and she just shrugged. Not particularly helpful.\n\nAppetizers:\nOn reading some reviews a friend and I decided to try the calamari, they serve it here in long strips and it was fried up nicely, but there was very little flavouring to it without any dipping sauce. The sauce they served it with seemed to be some sort of mayo-based sauce but I didn't really know what it was, and it didn't taste very good. Another of my friends ordered the fried bocconcini, it sounded nice but for $7 it came with 2 pieces, which is a little disappointing. The ceasar salad I ordered was tasty if a bit too salty.\n\nPizza:\nWhile I won't comment second hand on everyone else's pizza experience, I will talk about the one I tried. I ordered the Pescara, which sounded very nice as: tomato sauce, cheese, pancetta and hot peppers. First this is not the wood burning pizza you would expect. As reviewer Dave I. suggests this is not authentic wood burning pizza. The top had burnt crusts yet the cheese was completely evenly cooked and well spaced out and the bottom was soggy, and not crispy at all. The worst of it was the over-abundant use of hot peppers on this particular variation; the rest of the ingredients couldn't be tasted with the amount of hot peppers they used, it was just completely unbalanced. I would have tasted the same flavours had I just eaten some soggy dough and a jar of hot peppers.\n\nDessert:\nHere's where my biggest issue of the night started. When I called to book they had asked if I wanted a birthday cake. I thought \""why not?\"" and chose a cake. Now it's certainly my fault at this point for not asking the cost of this added service, but for they price they charged they could have mentioned it. This restaurant claimed to have made the cake in house and charged $5 per person for the cake (a total of $75). Now I know this is how some higher end restaurants work, and while I wouldn't call Arlequino's higher end, it's their right to choose this business model. My issue of contention is not the actual cost of the cake but the reaction of the owner of the restaurant when I spoke to him about this issue. I calmly and politely told him that if they were going to charge such an exorbitant amount for a tiny cake, the least they could do is tell people the cost up front without having to be asked. Had I known, I would have brought my own cake. His response was: \""We'd have charged you $3 per person if you brought your own. What can I tell you? It's business.\"" For me this was an inadequate response to a customer concern. I'm not saying I expected him to reimburse me for the cake; I didn't expect any sort of gratuity, but the man didn't even have the decency to apologize or attempt to appease me in any sort of way. This is no way to manage any sort of service industry business, let alone a restaurant. His response was equally cold and careless to one of my friends who tried to speak to him about the same issue. \n\nThat final experience of the night led me to understand Arlequino's for what it is. This is an upscale, supposedly hip pizzeria. The decor and ambience are fantastic, but their downfall is that they are far more invested in the look than the quality of food or their customers' satisfaction. I certainly imagine that the owner will begin to care more about his customers when they stop coming to eat at this restaurant."
1,"If you are looking for a great bar with excellent prices then look no further.  We went in on a Sunday night just after 10 pm. I had driven by earlier in the day and the parking lot was full, so it's a great place to watch a game with some buds and brew. I sat and talked with some of the regulars and it was a great conversation. It's the kind of place I wish didn't revolve around drinking, cuz I don't really like drinking all that much but I can see how somebody might get into that at the Deli Sports bar. I guess you could say the place can be addicting. From talking with the clientele it sounds like Friday and Saturday nights the place can be very busy, as well as the average Sunday and Monday night football season, (and I'm assuming any time a series of games are being played on the same day regardless of the sporting event.)\n\nThe juke box is awesome because it's actually hooked up to some proprietary Internet server system so you have tons of options for music (even classical, blues and Jazz). \nOne saw one person get a little out of hand but he was promptly dealt with, but even with that I would still like to go there the again.  Deli Sports Bar is relaxed atmosphere with excellent prices. The other reviews were very accurate."
1,"We went back for lunch today.  And the Nori was excellent.  When I commented on that, the hostess recognized us.  Long story short, she found the problem had been a chef mishandling the nori....and he's no longer there.\n\nLunch was excellent!  We give them 5 stars for sure - and my wife is really not a sushi lover.  Today she had a fried pork bowl and loved it.  I had the 7 piece sushi plate along with some sashimi.  Excellent, but as usual, more than I really needed.  But it's soooo good!"
1,"Actually this review is for the buffet. Hidden jewel to us. We did the Rio buffet (pretty good), hit Harrahs that was good but Flamingo for lunch had no line and the food was on point. July 4th and no crowd? Nice"
0,"After walking by here several times I really wanted to have one of those amazing looking milkshakes.  I got the fluffer nutter, because I love peanut butter and chocolate together.  I watched the lady make the milkshake.  I saw her pull out the gallon of D milk and I thought \""great, this is super fattening.\""  I saw her pull out the jar of Skippy peanut butter and I thouht \""great, this is something I could have made at home.\""  \n\nIt came in a plastic cup that looked smaller than the pictures and there were no Reese's Peanut Butter Cup bits on the top like in the picture.  I didn't say anyting but I was pretty disappointed it did not live up to the picture and description for a $9 milkshake."
0,"I do not get why any of you think the food is Good here .... OR HEALTHY!!! Where are the Nutritional Facts for any item on these menus? Anyone ever think about that. I was really happy to think there was a Healthy Restaurant here that was hip and fun but what I thought about this place does not represent what any of you went through.  The place is Crowded and smells Funny.  I ordered the Ahi Tacos and you can use some salt, Use sea salt for God's Sake.  It's Healthy and good for you.  Those were the driest nastiest fish tacos I have eaten in my life and I am very well traveled.  If you think no flavor means healthy you would be incorrect.  \n\nMy Boyfriend got their french fries so I tried a couple DISGUSTING they are drowned in a low grade Truffle oil and taste HORRIBLE! \n\nThe Sweet Potato fries were just ok.  They do not use any Fruits or Vegetables in Season, so they do not seem to know much about what they are doing.  The food cooked there is MEDIOCRE AT BEST!  Why this place gets crowded is BEYOND BELIEF! \n\nTell the cooks to learn how to cook out of passion and not out of routine. And put some nutritional Facts up about your food.  I want to know what I ingest and how much work I need to do later.  \n\nAnd I got a Milkshake, It was so RUNNY it wasn't a shake at all. It was MILK! Learn how to make a milkshake. If I could give you 0 Stars I would have. \n\nIf you go here thinking this is some good food obviously your Pallet has never been refined to great foods.  This place is gross."
1,"Brio is a nice, family friendly restaurant in Tivoli. Before I give ny opinion on the food, i have to tell you I am really, really annoyed with restaurants that serve cold, hard butter with warm bread. Bread isn't hot enough to melt the butter on contact so the bread basket is pretty much a wash. \n\nOn with the food....if a restaurant serves a steak salad, that's generally what I order. Enter the steak salad at Brio. It is FRICKIN DELICIOUS!! The steak is prepared medium rare, unless you ask it be prepared another way. I did not. My steak was perfect. Seriously. Perfect.  The salad was a mix of different lettuce, mushroom, cherry tomatoes, candied pecans and tons of gorgonzola. It's tossed with a creamy horseradish dressing. Next time, I'd ask for less dressing because I did find the salad was a little dressing heavy and because there really is a lot of gorgonzola on the salad. \n\nThe kids got penne with marinara and shrimp. They gobbled it up. The shrimp was cooked perfectly. They also ordered a small chocolate cake which, surprisingly, they didn't like.\n\nThe restaurant is nice. Service was good. We will be back."
0,"When I have gone to Vegas in the past I've always liked staying at Luxor. I get pretty good room rates and comps. This last stay (for my 30th birthday) sadly will be the last time. Their rooms are really run down. Granted you're in Vegas how much time are you suppose to spend in your room?? The bathrooms were really gross. I tried to get ready as fast as possible. I was worried some of stains in the shower would start talking to me or move. \nMy husband and I got \""VIP seating\"" next to the pool (whatever that means). The waitress service was excellent but we agreed the next time we pay for upgraded seating next to the pool we are doing it at Mandalay Bay.\nLuxor instead of just upgrading the casino bars and your nightclub please start to focus on the rooms. I guess you get what you pay for."
0,"My family and I went to eat here last night, they welcomed us in which was cool, they took our drink order as soon as we sat down which was nice. We weren't quite ready to order when they brought us our drinks and after that it took like 10 mins for them to come back to take our order... Then when our food arrived it was wrong we had to flag someone down and when they came they got an attitude that it wasn't correct. We waited forever before someone came to refill our drinks, they come and go so quick you can't even get a word in. We waited 15 mins for our bill and another 10 to get our card and receipts back! It was in all fairness busy however that doesn't entitle them to ignore tables or rush in and out without asking if everything was ok. The food was good but not great... Nothing to shout about IMO. I was more disgusted by the rudeness and the lack of giving a crap on how they treated their customers! I had been here before during lunch and it was always good this was the first time I had been in there for dinner and sadly the last time I will ever be back! Customer Service is so important! You pay yes for the food but also for great service and perhaps it was just a bad night for them...  But honestly they were too busy running around and not being careful, we witnessed them dumping a tray of drinks on a female customer, the table next to us also had the wrong order.... So bad night indeed."
0,"Went for lunch today. Wonderful service and very friendly staff.  Had a french dip, and the meat/bread and side were all fine, but the au jus was too sweet.  It wasn't bad, but I would prefer something more savory than sweet to dip in.  Ordered a selection of pies (4), and frankly, was disappointed in all of them. The filling tasted nearly identical in all 4 pies. They were bland, and more gelatinous than creamy as a \""cream\"" pie should be.  While the meringue was nice it doesn't compensate for the blah fillings. The attempt to distinguish the different pies by adding a sprinkle of generic chocolate sprinkles on one, and a few mini-chocolate chips on another was misguided.  The inside of the pie is what really matters, and the pie cook should reduce the quantity (number of selections) and focus on nailing the recipe for a few pie varieties before swamping the customer with a huge selection of mediocre (at best) pies. \n\nAll that said, the place is new, and is a much needed addition to the neighborhood. I hope they grow out of these \""newbie\"" mistakes, and improve the quality of the food (especially the pies).  I love pie, and would gladly go back again to give them a chance to change my mind."
0,"Even though the food was quite good, I have to give this place a poor review because our overall experience was so unpleasant.  We went on a Thursday night when there was live music and flamenco dancing.  It was so loud - starting rather early at 7:30 p.m. - and completely interfered with our ability to have any conversation at our table.  \n\nI will say that the food was pretty good.  I'd characterize it as pretty traditional Spanish tapas.  Our table particularly enjoyed the oxtail, the crab stuffed piquillo peppers and the patatas bravas.  Great sauces on the oxtail, the snails and the shrimp.\n\nI'd go back but only Monday through Wednesday when it would be quieter."
0,"$2 beer aside (which is awesome) the actual barbershop leaves a much to be desired. I've come here a number of times, since it's across the street from my wife's favorite coffee shop. (Press Coffee. Great spot.)\n\nI've had some great service here and some bad service. When you walk in here your just rolling the dice. I guess I could go back to the same barber every time but it doesn't really seem like anyone actually stays very long. The only guy I recognize when I go in is the owner. Seems like a different bunch every time. \n\nToday was pretty terrible. I waited quite awhile to get in (due to the staff/owner drama - not a long lineup. Had a gut feeling I should walk out. Should have.) I was rushed through and left feeling like the job was half done, little bits of hair falling in my eyes and mouth all the way home then did a little clean-up on the missed parts with my own razor. \n\nI'll try somewhere else next time. Hopefully I'll find a place that is consistent."
0,Ordered mock duck curry and mussamun curry. Very disappointed. Both Seemed very oily and extremely watery. The consistency of the curry was just not there. Potato in the curry tasted like it was canned. No authentic Thai flavors. Bland and tasteless. No taste of herbs or coconut milk. Have tried some of their noodles before which is good. Will probably give one more chance.
0,Not impressed...I'll stick to my fave - Smashburger.
1,"I love my gym. It's not perfect but it gets the job done. There are always treadmills, ellipticals, etc. available, even ones with TVs. I have never had a problem here. There are lots of TVs and they play good music. The bathrooms always seem clean. Sometimes I have to park in BFE but who cares, I'm there to exercise, not to get a good parking spot. I usually see a security guard driving around on a golf cart and have never felt unsafe at night. The kids working the front desk are always nice. My membership is super cheap and I can use any LVAC around town. My favorite part is the classes which don't cost extra. I LOVE body pump and Alicia is a great instructor. The spin instructors are great too, and the abs class. One con is a lot of the bikes in the spin class are falling apart so it's a tad ghetto, especially compared with the W Flamingo LVAC."

1,"Double Double with frys to go please!!!\n\nGreat burgers and food, not just for the price but as an overall meal. If this is on one corner and there are three other fast food burger joints on each of the other corners, I am going here.\n\nFresh cut frys and grilled onions on my burger, yup...I am in."
0,"It's a little bitter sweet for me here...I just never know what to expect is what i mean by that.\n\nNow I have gone to Lulu's countless times...every time being unique in it's own way, whether it's the food or the service and mostly not in a good way. I can't be a full supporter like most people are because the people that like Lulu's don't agree with my restaurant choices and only think Lulu's is God's gift to Plaza Midwood or to Charlotte at that, and will always put it at the top of they're list to recommend to people!!! That's fine but I really can't take their recommendation on anything else in this town then,sorry!! \n\nI came here two Sundays ago and will say that my service and food were both good (this time). It was also 2pm and they were very quiet I assumed we got there after their Brunch rush.\n\nOn all of my other visits here their has always been something wrong the service is my biggest of issues and then the food because one person can get something that is really good and the other person (me) get's something that is not...I'm really not that picky and am very tolerable but for some reason they have some of the worst servers in town (not to offend them)and they have one of the smallest restaurants in town so i think that's what really confuses me how is it humanly possible to not see that we are sitting there and have been w/o anything to drink or with no food for an extreme amount of time. \n\nI still go because like I said its everyone's favorite restaurant so either I dine alone at my favorites or I suck it up and hope for the best and get some mediocre food with some good friends! \n\nAgain for those that LOVE it I'm not knocking you for liking it I'm simply suggesting it not be your #1 suggestion all of the time...  ;)"
0,"This is the reason why I give Mr. Sandwich 1 star.\n\nI really enjoy Lee's Sandwiches from So-Cal and was excited to see this random sandwich place with vegetarian options.  In I went.  The bread is soft and really good, the fake meats and tofu are really yummy selections, they have veg. spring rolls... they taste great... the problem is this:\n\nThe first time I went in, my cousins and I ordered 5 sandwiches and got our 6th free.  They made my order wrong and gave me the wrong sandwich which was no biggie at all... except that as I ate I discovered a HAIR in my sandwich.  It was hard to get to them to let them know, but when I did, there was no real apology, just a \""Ok, we can remake it for you.\"" as if it was just a mix up order.\n\nI forgave them and went back the next day with my cousins to order more for the road.  The next day, as I bite into my spring roll, I discover again, ANOTHER HAIR in my spring roll.\n\nMr. Sandwich you taste good, but you are not clean.  I'm never eating here again in Vegas."
0,If I could give this place zero stars I would. I walked in hoping to get a manicure and they looked at me like I was going to rob them. These people need to learn about customer service.  Come here if you would like that get an attitude with your mani pedi.
1,"This popular New Orleans inspired restaurant has been calling me for 3 years. Finally I navigated into the Holsom shopping center for a taste.  Apparently everyone likes this place too as there was no immediate parking.  After 10 minutes of parking lot stalking I found a spot and went inside.  The dining room is small and jam packed with tables. It actually reminded me of some of the places I sampled ages ago when I was in New Orleans.  The menu has po' boy sandwiches, gumbo, creole, remoulade, catfish and more NOLA favorites.  The restaurant has been featured on Diner's Drive ins and Dives and the owner comes from New Orleans.  The wait staff was excellent.  Although they seemed like they were running around like a chicken with its head cut off, they all took time to ask how I was doing.  My waitress suggested the Bronzed Catfish and grits and I took the bait.  \n\nDue to the crowd, the wait for my meal was longer than I would have liked for lunch and I received several apologies from the waitress and the manager.  When the meal came, it was truly worth the wait.  The grits had absorbed the flavor of the well cooked catfish and the gouda/mushroom mixture.  The catfish was well seasoned with a light coating that didn't overpower the fish. \n\nThe bread was an afterthought and did not add anything to the meal but did assist in cleaning the last bites of grits off the plate.\n\nI would have liked it to have more of a cajun kick and will definitely try a spicier option the next trip out.\n\nI only have one New Orleans experience and it was in the early 90's so I am not an expert on New Orleans cuisine by any means but I can say I enjoyed Lolas and will return soon.  For lunch you can expect to pay between $9.00 for the least expensive Po'boy to $16.00 for the catfish and grits."

0,"Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n6 Food\n5 Service\n8 Atmosphere\n6 Value\n\nMajor let down.  I walk in and see a cozy patio and nice interior atmosphere, but the fun ends there.  They didn't have enough lunch menus for our table.  It was 1:30.  What the hell did they do at 12:30?\n\nOur server Ryan's timing was random, unstructured, and slow - and I had to ask twice for my drink.  From a place charging less than $11-$15 per cocktail, I could forgive this, but once we hit double digits on a small tumbler of booze, I require sharp service.  This wasn't even average.  For prices like this, service is a must.  Then came the big failure:  They cleared 5 people's plates, and left 1 because she was still eating.  If I ran a restaurant I would fire any server that I ever caught doing this, because I would have trained them properly.  You clear only after EVERYONE is done!  In hindsight I over-tipped.\n\nAnd finally the food was bland.  Except for the guacamole, which was great and might be the only thing I could cling to if challenged as to why they got 2 stars instead of 1."
0,"Let me say that I've been dining at Steak n' Shake since I was a kid in Florida. I've been to this restaurant often since they opened a few years ago. I've taken friends there and have been happy to share the place with those who have never heard of it. But this franchisee is violating their contract as of late.\n\nI went there with my friend Friday for lunch and I can tell you it was nothing but horrible. First they brought us our shakes in styrofoam to-go cups, uh...we're dining-in here. When we complained they mostly said tough, we've run out of glassware. After that, people around us were getting their shakes in glassware. On top of this the milkshakes were horrendous. They tasted like frozen fast food product and had a very icy texture like a Wendy's Frosty. They were definitely not the hand dipped ice cream milk shakes I have enjoyed all of my life at Steak N Shake.\n\nThen when the burgers came I took one bite and could tell it didn't taste proper plus I couldn't see any cheese. I told the waitress and she stuck her fingers in between the patties and showed me the cheese, like 3 or 4 little melted specks. I said it doesn't taste right and sent it back. She said that she would have to make another one since she stuck her fingers in it, how gracious of her, but to which I responded my appetite is lost, just take it off the bill. I tried to complain to the manager, an Indian lady named Naryet or something like that and she basically blew me off. \n\nMy friend was hungry and went on to eat his and later paid dearly for it. He called me that evening complaining of severe stomach pains and vomiting.\n\nThis franchise is cutting corners and I am sure are in violation of their contract. They have no understanding of the ambiance and mystique of the classic American burger diner that Steak N Shake exemplifies. This is what happens when irresponsible franchisees run businesses like this and the franchiser doesn't pay attention and just counts the money. I really hated to see this since living in Vegas is a far different experience from the south where I grew up. It was nice to go to that restaurant and feel like a little bit of nostalgia existed but it's gone."
1,711meets whole foods (and there you have it). Not quite as good as trader joes but it also has less frills and les hippie pretentiousness. Nice quality neighborhood market. They have great pre made meals and great lemonade & tea.
1,"I just had a late lunch here with my Mom. We ordered the sesame noodles, grandma's pot stickers and the duck bao. We shared everything and we loved it all! It was the perfect amount of food for us and we left being happy as can be! Tammi Jo was awesome and so sweet. We will definitely come back here and try all the items! It is located in the Eureka casino and it's actually a pretty ok place. The restaurant was decorated very nicely, and I love the red glitter booths, it was super clean and I highly recommend coming here!"

Seriously? \n\nI don't appreciate anyone telling me what I can't and can do with my money.  Don't they see how obvious it is?  They think that if I tip less, I'll play more.  Wrong!  I'll go to Red Rock from now on."

1,"Central Library is undoubtedly my favourite library and one of my favourite places to hang out in Edinburgh. It's a veritable treasure trove for the literary minded and a great place to spend a few hours if you're a bit skint. The ground floor has a large selection of books; ranging from fictional novels to foreign language titles to travel guides, it also has a good selection of DVDs that are far cheaper to rent than those in video shops. The first floor reading room is like taking a step back in time, there is a beautiful domed ceiling and lots of ancient reference books. There are tables where you can read newspapers and computers where you can browse the internet for free - all in wonderful, deathly silence. Bliss."

The server was great all thru the night and we got 2 free cocktail samples each, and gave us a very good recommendation of sake.\n\nLater we had the pleasure meeting the owner, who was very friendly.\n\nWe never got to the dessert because the sushi rolls was really toooo goood!\n\nI will come back thats for sure!"
0,"I originally purchased ownership at this location in 2005. Back then, when an Owner booked a room here, they were given a \""Welcome Gift\"" upon check-in that included things like a travel size toothpaste, a ladies razor, mints, floss, coupons for shopping and dining and sometimes even a hat. Also included was a 10% discount for the Marketplace located on the 1st floor, which comes in handy if you forgot something or wanted to pick up a quick sandwich instead of going out to eat since there is nothing really close by if you're in a hurry.\n\nNow your \""Welcome Gift\"" consists of some coupons for dining at the Las Vegas Hilton, coupons for the Harrah's properties, shopping discounts for Macy's, a discount or free appetizer (I can't remember) for Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville and Planet Hollywood Restaurant. None of which were of any use to me. Toothpaste, I can always use. Also no longer offered? Any sort of discount at the ONLY place inside the property to get food, drinks, etc. Zip. Zilch. Nada. \n\nReally? I've dumped THOUSANDS of dollars into this place already and I can't even get a measly 10% off of a deli sandwich after a 5-hour drive to get here? Are you f'ing kidding me?\n\nAlso, if I tell the Agent when I book the reservation that I don't want to attend a presentation during my stay, I expect NOT to be asked repeatedly to attend. Three \""No's\"" during the initial conversation, coupled with three \""No's\"" when I checked in, compounded by another two \""No's\"" after checking in when an Agent called my room is not acceptable. NO means NO.\n\nWhen I get inside the room, I feel at home. I wish my apartment was this nice, but the aggravation that goes along with \""ownership\"" is beyond annoying. I'm now debating selling."
0,"Okay I have to give it two stars just because it really isn't much more than a nice Motel 6 or Best Western that is in Las Vegas.  With that said though I was completely shocked with my stay.  My wife and I stayed one night just to catch some sleep before me moved over to one of the other hotels on the strip, and I was fearing the worst.\n\nWe paid $20 for one night, and I closed my eyes while opening the door to my room, half expecting to find a room that would make me wish my wife would let us sleep in the car.\n\nThe room was quite clean, surprisingly decent sized, and the bed was even somewhat comfortable.  I would definitely NEVER stay here for more than one night, but if you need a place for a one night layover or looking for an incredibly cheap place to stay, you may want to check it out."
1,"Sassi's is a fantastic place for a special occasions.  Of course, if you have a big enough food budget you could go for fun all the time!  The ambiance is top-notch, and the building itself is beautiful.  I would sit outside near sunset in nice weather if possible.  Gorgeous views.\n\nThe food, wine, and service is also top-notch.  I've eaten here several times and each time the food blew us away, and the waitstaff is very knowledgable and enjoyable to talk to.  All the plates just seem to be perfect.  Whether we had the small plate of nuts for an appetizer, or a beef or fish main course, or the desert, it all was presented beautifully and was delicious.  This is probably the best restaurant overall that I've been to, and I've been to a lot!"
0,"I absolutely hate this gym! Always crowded. Used to be crowded between the hours 5-7pm. Now it seems like all hours of the day it's jam packed! Constantly waiting for machines and weights. Not to mention nothing is ever re-racked. Oh, the tiny bopper girls and the \""swagged\"" out teenaged boys are the most annoying and take up a lot of the space standing in their circles around equipment. Needless to say, I will not be signing another contract."
1,"I leapt out of bed in terror at twenty past noon today, thinking I was going to miss the Market because I'd overslept. My day's plans hinged on visiting the Market! In forty minutes I was showered, dressed and out the door, determined to make it for the last leg of the Saturday Farmers' Market.\n\nSo very glad I did - when I got there, mildly lightheaded from dashing out on an empty stomach, I immediately filled up with a coffee from a box conveniently located at the very start (or end?) of the market and a sausage roll from one of the stalls. Revived, I was ready for a good wander and a peer at the wares.\n\nThis market is smaller than I'm used to, but coming from Seattle, where fresh produce and local meats are essentially worth their weight in gold, I'm spoiled. Despite its size, the market has everything you could want - plenty of juicy local meats, fresh-caught seafood, fruit and veg, cheese, honey, soap... trucks from Oink and Well Hung and Tender were also on hand, frying up tasty grub for the lunchtime crowd. Everything is fresh and local, so if you're a discerning shopper, the market is right up your alley. \n\nI'll definitely be back to peruse the wares, and perhaps try more of the ready-made foods. What could be better than eating your lunch, directly from the grocer, in the shadow of the castle?"
1,"Absolutely the BEST pizza and calzones in town!  This is a typical NY pizzeria with very little atmosphere, but the food makes up for it.  They even deliver.  If you're a transplanted New Yorker or just cannot find real NY pizza anywhere, this is the place for you!"
0,Don't come here i thought I would be given priority for having an appointment and i was early for it. Been waiting for hours for a simple strep test. You can tell they don't care about their patients and the waiting room is filthy.
1,"Like others here I lament the loss of Ken.  But I'll bet he'll be a good doctor.  I've known Diego a LONG time (working for Ken).  So I still come here.  The service I received today was prompt and friendly from both people I dealt with (including Diego).  I cannot say if I was overcharged.  It was expensive.  Checking online I see prices ranging from about what they charged me to about 1/2 of what they charged me.  I suspect many of the cheaper ones are \""knock-offs\"", which I would not want.\n\nIt will be sad if they have started the overcharging-mechanic game.  They were always honest and fair here.  If I find out otherwise I will amend this review and take away the stars.  I will pay close attention when I come back for a tune-up in 6 months or so."
0,"Arrived at terminal 3 went to frontier checking and thought the person taking\n me in was rude. Wanted a different seat. Ask if I wanted to up grade. Moving over a seat in same row is upgrade, would cost me .  Then looked at medical bag and wanted to charge   Cheap cheap cheap. Flying is becoming joke. Nickel and diming to death   Flight was on time stewardess 's were friendly. Just airport personnel,need a course in being friendly"
0,Not into it.  In the mall in Planet Hollywood.  Order at the counter and you are given a pager.  There is bad music blasting from the mall which you are still in.  The food was okay.  I'm surprised this place has gotten such good reviews.
0,"The Good: Can't go wrong with outlet prices, with lower tax (compared to cali) it's a nice place to buy without costing too too much. The store has relatively newer items compared to the Primm outlet store with saffiano items in display.\n\nThe bad: the store is always packed with people and there's not so much of a walking space either. \n\nThe Ugly: CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE. Yes it's all caps because it's the only way I can make my words come across with the horrid customer service they have. I had purchased something from the Primm for mother's day, decided to take a quick peek at this store and I decided another bag would be better suited for my mommy. Lo and behold when I was discussing this issue with the guy at the register. He was just so standoffish and not accommodating at all. Standing at the register for more 20 minutes or so without any update of what the hell is going on. When the return/exchange was almost complete he said he couldn't credit back the remaining balance, so I had to look for something close to the balance account. When I told him I needed time to look around and decide he just gave me a look and a sigh of being annoyed. Well, sorry to be such a nuisance mister. But I AM a paying customer you know. He could've said those terms while I was standing there for 20 mins doing nothing. Not going back here ever again."
0,"Worst Starbucks service in the general area. The location is beyond slow inside or through the drive through. If you can avoid this location, do it. Otherwise if you have ample time to sit around and wait for your coffee for 2-3 times longer that you should, this is the Starbucks for you."
1,"Delicious!  I had the pan seared salmon and the Asian nachos.  WOW.  \n\nService was great and I had plenty of refills, never had to ask.  Great experience, I will be back."
0,The wait is nuts hostess told us 30 minutes been waiting almost an hour now.  If they say 10 more minutes we are gonna die.  When we finally did get seated the food was good and reasonably priced.  Make sure you get a table outside and make sure you keep the hostess honest on your wait.
0,"what a terrible place, and it is a shame because trapeze is so much fun but gets ruined by the douchebagery of the owner."
1,"It's not five star, but really it's not their fault they're in Las Vegas and not Chinatown San Francisco. \n\nAnd that's what I compare it to. Anyways, my favorite dishes are Shrimp noodle and Beef Noodle, because that ponzuesque sauce is to die for! Also the BBQ Pork buns, whether you go sweet or not are amazing.\n\nI routinely come here and eat far more than I need to. The only draw back is that not enough people come here so the carts aren't always popping out fresh stuff, so things can become luke warm. But the food is still amazing.\n\nThe best Dim Sum in Las Vegas bar none!"
1,"This has been my neighborhood bar for about a decade.  Good pool tables, reasonable drink prices (cheap Guinness during Happy Hour).  Good staff and a very mixed crowd."
1,"Fantastic! Great place to grab a tall glass of wine, great appetizers, and even dessert! The atmosphere is relaxing and the hummus is outstanding! P.S. The cappuccino and the espresso is also delicioso!"
0,"As I read some of these reviews I can relate. As Alex and Michael stated the food is SOOO bland and I wonder why I keep going back. It is always hot in there and the tables outside are always dirty. (Like others said as well)\nSara B. Im warning you, dont go back to try them you will regret it  HAHA! \nI really, really wanted to love this place. Its so close to my condo & not much else around there. I have been prob 4 or 5 times for food, trying new things and probably 20 because the sweet tea WAS amazing in the hot summer. Now they changed that and its not that great and its half the size as before.\nThe other day we ordered carry-out grilled chx breast plain with bbq on the side with cole slaw, burger well with mac and cheese and two sweet teas. Things have changed, but its still bad, now worse. My husband grew up in Virgina Beach/NC and knows southern food. Unfortunately this place has never got it right, which I so desperately wanted to love it I gave it WAY more chances, than normally I would. The lady told me give me 15-20 minutes. About 15 minutes later my husband is walking out the door and my phone rings. I said \""Wait\"" thats the BBQ place. I answer, she tells me, We've had some construction and I cant find the Chx Breasts. WHAT? Are you serious?LOL It took you 15 minutes to call me and say that and how do you \""lose\"" food? Anywho I ended up ordering white shredded chx sandwich. She said 10 minutes. He sat around and then went up to pick it up. When he got their the guy told him, he was sorry for the call and they just had a huge order come in that cleaned them out of Chx. Breasts. WHAT are you serious? That is not what the lady told me, its like just be honest ppl! Then we get our food. I stg the Cole Slaw tastes like Miracle Whip and pepper or something. SOOO bland. The Mac and Cheese is so bland, I felt like I was eating Macaroni with a light cheese paste. It was bad. The sandwich was slimy and so gross I almost threw up. I put it back in the box and in the bag. My husband had 3 bites of the hamburger and felt sick. He NEVER complains about restaurants. He said to me, Why do we keep going here? Its always the same and terrible! I had no answer...\n I called the restaurant back to let her know how horrible this food was and we both felt sick, and she goes \""Well what do you want\"" I said WHAT I just wanted to let you know. She said \""Do you want another order?\"" I said no way. I am sick to my stomach and so is my husband. She was soooo rude to me. I said Listen I thought you would want to know. She said \""Bring the food back up and I will give you a refund.\"" I was going to and had it all boxed up, but I just didnt have time to get back up there. Its not like thats what I want to do on my Sunday afternoon. I had WAY to much to do.I will NEVER be back and I will NEVER tell anyone to try it. I saw a GROUPON for there before, DON'T DO IT. Not worth it. Dont try it! \nMy neighbors in the condos said the same thing recently when chatting with them.  \nThe guy ( I think he owns it) that is always there is super cool. There are a couple females that always seem like they are in a bad mood for some reason. \nTrust me, its not cheap and its not good. Not worth it!"
1,"Great fresh Mexican food, great staff, we love to come here"
0,"Friday night at 5pm. No cleaning lady and I have been waiting for my bed to get cleaned for 9 minutes now. The girl at the front desk will push lotion on you like a used car salesman while everyone waits to be served. You pay per session. No matter how long you go 5 min or max time, you pay full price. Oh and the best bed I paid for in packages is broke today. *shakes his head* I miss Darque Tan"
1,Been to a lot of outlet malls and this one is by far the best one in Vegas. The only other outlet that compares in terms of number of quality stores is the Cabazon outlets in SoCal. Enjoy!
1,"The kid had a great day at school, so it seemed an opportune time to hit Mary Colye's before it closes next month.  Being new(er) to Phoenix, we knew nothing of it until a few weeks ago.  So sad that they're closing, especially after our experience tonight!  The service was good, the ice cream to die for.  *sigh*  We'll have to stock up before their doors close!"
1,"WHoa this place is amazing! Thanks to Karine S for introducing me, after enjoying a crazy hot chocolate there yesterday I was in a ridiculously good mood for hours. \n\nMiss Choco specializes in what they call 'bean to bar' chocolate makers. The chocolates they sell are almost all made by people who live near the cocoa farms, buy directly from the farmers, and then do 100% of the processing on their own. These chocolates are a labour of pure love and you can taste it. Wildly rich, clean, crazy good. If you are a chocolate lover you must go try their hot chocolates, and their cocoa bean infusion which is like a tea that smells like your best dreams. And then buy one or two of their gorgeous bars. This place is where I'll go from now on whenever I need a show stopping gift, or a smile to last hours, or just the smell and taste of my best dreams to wash back over me. The young couple that own this spot are earnest and smart and great, I wish them chocolatey mountains of success in this super sweet endeavor!"
1,"walked in and i was surprise it was just like a doctor's office but there is no window, just a sign on the door that says to wait for someone to get you if you have an appointment.  Marianne is such an awesome lady.  she was fast and sociable and talked me through the whole procedure.  i got the braziilain wax.  it didn't hurt as much  as i anticipated and i didn't take any tylenol/advil before i went.  i'll definitely be going back."
0,"So after writing a very accurate review on Yelp about my experience with this business, I was faced with calls from the owner in which: \n1) He admitted that Gene's costs are 15-20% lower than his costs\n2) Invalidated my experience and tried to make me out to be a liar- unsuccessfully. Jack did tell me the work needed to be done, and that if I couldn't do the full $400+ work he was recommending right away, I at least had to have the brake fluid done immediately- which Gene informed me was not true on my first visit. None of it was necessary.\n3) He then called my new mechanic and bothered him about this situation....only to find out that Gene still stands by exactly what he has always stated (that the work was not necessary), and the software that Gene uses does not agree with what they use at this shop.\n4) There was then a voicemail, which I have saved, from the owner of Bridwell trying to bribe me with $100 cash to meet him at my new mechanic's shop to try and prove something about the fluids.....though the review I wrote was in regards to why I stopped going to Bridwell over a year ago, thus making it a desperate and invalid attempt to remedy the review I wrote. \n\nSo what if Gene's shop is in Tempe in an industirial area and not in the heart of Scottsdale. Seriously? Are you kidding me? Who cares!  I'm not moving in! Maybe Bridwell's location has something to do with the pricing issues they have...figure they can get away with it in that neighborhood. Gene has 38 shining reviews on Yelp, (with the exception of 1 disgruntled reviewer), and 3 out of 8 reviews for Bridwell state they ask for unnecessary repairs that are over-priced even if they are necessary. So you be the judge. \n\nAnd if you do leave a not so positive and honest review to assist your fellow Yelpers in finding good service- I hope you have a good code name on here, because this owner will look you up and you will be called and bothered in his attempts to invalidate everything you have said...even if he doesn't have all the facts."
1,"First time here. Full bar and tasty looking breakfast/brunch/lunch menu. Very chill vibe and the bartender Jodie was very very sweet. \n\nCheck out their hours. They are different on Mondays & Tuesdays as opposed to the rest of the week.\n\nWill come back again to try the \""happy eggs\"""
1,"Definitely the best buffet I've had in a while. The place was really well-done, with huge Willy Wonka flower/fruit arrangements all around. Cheery colors and everything looked spotlessly clean. Huge selection of buffet items and most of it was good enough for seconds..or thirds. Sea bass was actually well crusted and really flavorful, so probably one of the few few times I've liked fish at a buffet. I kept going back for the rack of lamb, which was nicely seasoned and cooked to a pink perfectness. Sushi was the only FAIL, but really, you can't expect good or even decent sushi from a buffet ever. I also really liked the crab legs. HUGE suckahs and they weren't too salty from the brining. Dessert aisles were amazing! Tiramisu was the highlight in a cute little glass, but the creme brulee and the caramel rice pudding (weird combo, but it somehow worked) were good also. Ice tea was really tasty, perfumey and refreshing. I kept thinking about it for the thirsty days we were in LV.\n\nOnly drawback was that we were basically told to leave by the waitress since they needed our table for a big group, so dinging them for a star. We were definitely willing to do so, but she hung around and kept dropping not-so-subtle hints about how we should go have a good night..."
0,"My experience is based on Sunday Brunch:\n\nAlthough the food was good, it was way over priced for brunch.  Coming from DC, I've experience much better brunch cafe's that included bottomless (insert alcoholic brunch drunk here) and cheaper - which says a lot comparing Pittsburgh to DC.  \n\nI'd go back, but it's not on the top of my list."
0,"Wait time was terrible! When we did get our food the eggs were cold.  Waitress was nice, I know not her fault for the cooking time."
0,"Vegas weekend with my girl and this was our first stop to eat.  In summary, we ordered the recommendations of yelpers and our server and the food was just alright.  Our server was great and attentive, but the food was just ok.  Not worth getting into the details, I will not be going back."
1,"Took my pup into Best in Show early this morning to get a grooming. Like several other dog parents, I'm not really particular about the cut- I just prefer his hair to be cut short and his tail to be fluffy. Jamie assured me that she would personally groom my mutt after I experienced a few short comings last time I came in, and now am really happy I bought him in again.\n\nMy little guy is a little temperamental about his personal space. I warn every groomer that he's sensitive about his paws, and Jamie seemed to handle him well. She got his hair cut about as perfectly as I've ever seen it, nails trimmed to a nice length, and his tail fluffy as I requested. Jamie informed me that she was unable to brush his teeth because he just wasn't tolerating it- I appreciate that kind of forwardness.\n\nWhat really put this place over the top was the selection of goods they offer in the store and the quality of customer service they strive for. They offer some really great quality pet odor eliminating candles, don't worry if you're like me and can't pick between 2- they're only $10 each. On my way out, I saw some dried tendon chews on a bottom rack. When I inquired about them, the cashier offered me a small one to try. Buddy munched on that thing all the way home- he didn't even want to come stand on my lap with this head out the window. I'll definitely need to stock up next time. \n\nPROS:\nCompetitive pricing (don't forget to check in for $5 off your groom).\nExcellent quality grooming.\nHonest groomers will encourage you to go over the cut before you leave.\n\nCONS:\nToo far from where I live in NLV."
0,"Overall clean and modern facility, with the following issues: \n\nThey do not open until 8am on saturday and sunday (which makes a difference in the summer when it's very hot by this time or you're training for an event). They don't have a regular abdominal crunch machines. (they only have matrix ab crunch machines that can usually only be used by guys since they require more weight to be lifted.) The stair climbers have a time limit of 30 minutes, and are usually taken up."
0,"I'm in Charlotte for business and asked the staff at the front desk for restaurant recommendation.  She enthusiastically recommended CM.  \n\nI was very disappointed.  The service was terrible. I asked to tell me what most people (regulars) ordered when dining there.  He replied \""steak, chicken, fish.\"". I said I wanted to know what items the ordered from the menu.  He pointed to the Trout.  What a jerk.  He brought my dish, which came 5 minutes after I ordered & was not very appetizing in presentation or taste.  I ordered the wild mushroom & chicken crepes... Not good.  I left him a 10% tip which was over tipping.\n\nWish I had gone to PF Changs instead.\n\nBeautiful city however, I wish I was staying longer."
1,"The menu isn't large,  but the food is very tasty!  I haven't tasted any of the beers but I hear they are great.  Wait staff are always timely and attentive."
1,"While the wait was very long, I can understand why... Dr. Giaccobe is awesome and willing to answer any and all questions that you have. She's empathetic and very blunt, which I appreciate greatly.\n\nThe ultrasound equipment that is used is top notch and Patty, our u/s tech explained everything in detail that was going on on the screen. \n\nAdditionally, I really liked the front desk staff (they also perform check out) and they kept me aware of what my co-pay would be ahead of time. I would say that the only downside would be the nurse that called me back. I wish she had been a little friendlier, but still, it was not the worst I've experienced.\n\nOverall, I am looking forward to my next visit and wish they did the actual prenatal/delivery care instead of just side by side with my regular doctor."
0,"Having met the man twice and finding him quite the entertaining character, I decided to try the restaurant inspired by him. Oscar Goodman. The (formerly) happiest mayor on earth. And former mob defense attorney. He and his image are quintessential Vegas. I had to try his steakhouse. \n\nEntering with a coworker at 8 pm on a Monday night, we were seated right away. Service can only be described as short and surly. From the hostess to the two servers we encountered, I consistently got the strong impression they were looking at their watches in anticipation of closing time. A stark contrast to, say, Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse over at Golden Nugget (see separate review). \n\nThe menu is mob-inspired, consisting of names of gangsters you'll recognize. I went with the Spilatro's Steak with garlic mashed potatoes. It may not look like much from the attached photo, bit it was actually quite good. \n\nThe restaurant is adorned with photos of Oscar and his career. I think the theme works fine here, and the location is great. It's in the area formerly occupied by Firefly, directly at the West end of Fremont Street. The dining area over looks the Fremont Street Experience. It's an excellent view. \n\nAll in all, the food was good. The theme was fun. But the service not so much. I'm always deeply disappointed when a place gets so much right and then just drops it all at customer service. How do other places like Vic's get it right consistently and places like this don't? I think it starts at the top. Carefully screening the right personalities to hire and then training and evaluating them. Consistently. \n\nOscar's needs to make an attempt, here. And until they do, the servers will bring down the house. This may be why there was so much open seating at 8 pm during Spring Break week. \n\nI sincerely hope they do bring it around because I'd like to see this place survive. If enough people point this out to them, maybe they will."
0,Today there is a line to the door and your manager only has three people working the line! You need to learn to react better towards serving your customers. Also tell your manager (male) to pull his pants up. It's not professional...amongst other things! You guys have some work to do!
0,"Absolutely terrible!!! Does cheap mean that I have to put up with FILTH?? The self-parking garage is disgusting, Footprints on walls and ceilings. DO NOT GO INSIDE THE GARAGE ELEVATOR. 3.The room 2051, was old and disgusting. From a housekeeping standpoint, the room was clean. From a room condition aspect, it was old, worn and outdated. The furniture was old and had many scratches from years of wear and tear. The carpet had many disgusting stains on it. There was an old musty smell to it. STAY AWAY- don't let the cheap prices fool you, or you will come out looking like the fool......like me. )c:"
1,"Good food good service thou pricey. It's Vegas n it's inside the hotel. Expected. \nWe had the salmon rillette. Good. \nTuna tartare. Above average. Still good. \nThe bread w butter n mashed olive spread. Good. \nI wanted medium well 14 oz prime ny for my kids to share. It came out well done but still juicy so acceptable. \nHad 6 pieces of raw oysters. Not bad but not that great. May be because they were not that busy. Server said because they are usually a convention guests restaurant where there's a corporate credit card that can be charged to, in other words expensive!\nI recommend it. Not bad."
0,"The ambiance is great. I ordered a chicken burrito, the chicken was very good, as was the tortilla... simplistically speaking it was decent, but it lacked interest. I had hoped for beans, cheese, fresh chips and salsa. For what it lacked, the cute, western small town made up the difference."
1,"Excellent.  Been here on three different trips now.  The food is varied -- it's hard to choose! -- but uniformly excellent.  Big portions -- once we took lunch back to the Vdara and basically had it again (happily!) for dinner.  Everything has been great, and don't fear ordering the basic stuff, like the extra-long chili dog."
1,"Checked this place out for dinner based on proximity to my hotel, and Yelp reviews.  I'm sooooo happy I did.  I was in Scottsdale for the night on business and stopped into Grassroots with no expectations.  It was a Tuesday night and the place was surprisingly pretty packed.  I found the one lone seat at the bar and was promptly greeted by a friendly bartender.  \n\nI saw the couple next to me order a cup of soup and it looked good (I'm a creepy food peeper), so I decided to try it.  The soup of the day was Chicken Tortilla.  I was planning on picking the tortilla strips out, but there was cheese stuck to them and I couldn't fathom wasting cheese, so I took one for the team and ate them.  The soup was seriously to die for.  As I was eating it, I was texting a friend and explaining how I would be bathing in that soup if hadn't just showered.  THAT's how good it was.  \n\nI also tried the Cardiff salad which was a chopped salad with shrimp.  It was one of the best salads I've ever had.  I went in there starving, and could only finish half the salad.  It was loaded with shrimp, and the dressing was amazing.\n\nThe atmosphere is classy and trendy, the staff is super efficient and pleasant.  If I'm back in the area, I will definitely re-visit."
0,"I've taken hot yoga from many studios in Phoenix, and this is by far the WORSE.\n\nI'm pretty sure the instructor Dawn has A.D.D. She couldn't seem to focus on the class. The class was in shambles. Everyone of doing different positions, it was ridiculously unorganized. Dawn would start counting down a pose, then forget about the class and start doing her own moves in the mirror, then remember about us and start counting down again at a totally different number.\n\nShe'd put us in a pose, then start random chatting with people, and totally forget about us. It was a total waste of time. Speaking of time....the class is scheduled for 1hr/25min. I think the class is soo long to schedule in Dawn's day dreaming. The class started almost 10 minutes late, and went WAY OVER 1hr/25mins. I was ready to scream! Thank god I only went there on a $20 coupon. I'm never going back."
1,"This place is very relaxing. There are showers, saunas, steam rooms, a yoga room, clay bead rooms where you can lay on top of warm clay beads, hot warm and cold tubs, and a quiet room where there's a bar and eating area and a nice Korean lady cooking up some delicious Korean food and tea, the Korean medicine tea and ginger tea is excellent! Nice quiet place if you are sore or tired and just need to relax, or sweat and detoxify. I bring all my toiletries and they provide lockers, they have toiletries there but I like to bring mine, and then a whole area you can blow dry your hair or do your facial ritual, and you'll walk out feeling like a new person. :D"
0,"I wish I would have read the reviews before dining here. The truth is they deserve at least two stars for the wonderful food. There is no doubt about it those cheese fries, onion rings and nachos were yummy and really hit the spot. However, if I had to rate the service it would be zero stars. We had to wait to be sat for almost twenty minutes and when we walked into the restaurant there were two servers and only nine guests. Why did we wait outside so long? We waited another 17 minutes and our server never came to our table! I went and found the manager and told him that we've been waiting for way too long and we have no utensils and no server to take our order. The manager was really sweet and took our order at that moment and had the busboy bring us utensils. We ate half of our meal before the waiter (Francisco according to our receipt) finally came by and placed down the onion rings. He did not introduce himself, we asked if he was our server and he rudely said yes and then left. The only other time we saw him was when he dropped off our check with attitude.\n\nPrepare yourself for a long wait, terrible service but good food."

1,"Love Love Love forever 21 \n It was the official grand opening in the Fashion Show mall in Las Vegas July 24, 2010.\n\nOMG, WOW, Overwhelming, enormous and massive are words that come to mind. Did I say gargantuan?\n\nThe new location is 2 levels and 124,000 sq feet and not crowded. Except for the crowds of customers shopping.\n\nThey did a tremendous job, the store looks impressive!\n\nStarting with the visuals - the windows were dazzling and all the displays and mannequins thru out the store were brilliant. Lots of glitter and gold! If mannequins could talk they were shouting \""buy me\"", \""be me\"", \""stare at me\""!\n\nThe layout of the store is easy to shop they have all their different labels divided into sections. Sort of like stores within a store. Be sure to check out the new Kids section. T\n\nhey now carry Men's, maternity, faith 21[extended sizes] at this location. As well as the usual Heritage [vintage], love 21, twelve by twelve [couture line] and they have a shoe + accessories section.\n\nDon't worry about waiting for a change room; they have one in every corner of the store. With lots of rooms in each one. All the change rooms have mirrors inside and hooks to hang up your 6 room limit. Lots of friendly staff hanging outside the change rooms trying to hang up the clothes you don't want to put back on the racks.

1,"Omg... this show was awesome, as well as HILARIOUS!  There were a lot of older ladies, and a few older males attending the show, which I thought was hilarious.  \n\nThey pulled a grandma on stage, and she was soo tiny, compared to the men, it was hilarious!\n\nI have to say, the guy with the nipple rings is freaking sexy!  The way he moves --oh-so-seductively fierce.  Haha.  After our group took the picture with them (which cost $20/per person!!! Expensivo! =( but well worth it!) I guess he was standing greeting people.  I told him he had nice nipple rings, and he gave me a wink.  *Faints*.  Haha Kidding!"
0,"I was really happy to find another vegetarian restaurant in the Phoenix area.  My wife and I enjoy Loving Hut, but it's always nice to find more variety.\n\nWe entered Green with high expectations considering the good reviews we saw here on Yelp.  I ordered a veggie burger (of course), my wife got a meatball po' boy, and my daughter got a rice bowl of some type.  There were also some appetizers such as egg(less) rolls, and their chili fries.\n\nChili fries--I looked forward with great anticipation to these, and it looks like I expected too much.  What passes for \""chili fries\"" here are shoestring potatoes lightly sprinkled with thyme (not bad in themselves) which are then covered with a concoction of what appears to be Morningstar Farms veggie crumbles mixed with tomato sauce and one or two spices which I couldn't identify.  It was really not all that good.  It tasted like someone was trying to doctor up veggie crumbles and really didn't know how.  I'll say this much--it wasn't \""chili\"" in any capacity that I would recognize.\n\nIn terms of the burger, I think that, at least at first, they did a good job of masking the blandness of the the red bean patty at the center.  The presentation and appearance was pretty nice.  However, by the time I took my last few bites, I was needing to wash it down with my Diet Coke.  Again, it was a not very successful attempt to make a meatless food attractive, hip, and tasty.  You can do it if you know how.  I'm not sure if the folks in the kitchen at Green really have a handle on it.\n\nMy wife's po'boy was a similar story.  Again, looked like Morningstar Farms meatless meatballs.  They put them in a bun with \""mum's sauce\"" and soy cheese.  I tried a bite.  Tasted like a meatless meatball coated in ketchup on a bun.\n\nThe egg(less) rolls were. . .okay.  Again, there was something missing in the flavor.\n\nThe atmosphere was \""hip\"" and cool.  The bathrooms were actually really neat looking.  Service was friendly and helpful.  The food was eh.  Don't be fooled into thinking that because they put up this big presentation and say with fanfare \""WE'RE VEGAN!\"" means that the food here is good.  It's really mediocre and the only thing preventing it from being one star in my opinion is the work that they put into decor, atmosphere, and service.  If you want to come here with a friend, share a basket of thyme fries or a dessert, you probably won't be disappointed.  If you want a great meatless meal in the Phoenix area, however, the Supreme Master Ching-Hai has the lock on it."
1,"Came here for brunch a few weeks ago. \n\nWe were told that there was a $5 flatbread special on Sundays and got the Imperial swine.  It was delicious. I highly recommend their flatbread. I loved the texture. \n\nWe also got a few entrees and split them. My hubby got the chicken and waffles which were delicious. I really liked the bacon maple syrup. I got one of the grilled cheeses called the Wang chunk tonight, which had this delicious sweet chili chicken on it. I really liked it. I also got it with the cajun fries. I was not really impressed with both the fries or the tomato soup,  but the grilled cheese was so good! \n\nWe also got dessert (I know dessert at brunch,  but we were full until the next day at dinner time) which was called the because I got high. This is the most decadent and ridiculous dessert I have ever encountered. Everyone should get one to share with 6 friends! \n\nOverall I can't wait to go back  and try more of the menu!"
1,Wonderful restaurant! \nGreat service. Very friendly and very helpful.\nThe food was amazing! I had the farm burger and loved it!\n\nComfortable seating and great environment.
1,"Service here is always prompt, thoughtful(suggestions galore) and steady... and valet parking is a short stroll from the nearby Aria entrance. The ambiance is airy and open, and the bar setup (fruit instead of fake tapas) is witty and hip for a tapas-style spot. \n\nTapas: I begin each meal with a cheese plate(highly recommended) or the pan manchego? So far, I most enjoy the salmon with truffle(I often order two) and some other seafood dish I cannot presently recall. Lobster gazpacho is a must for those who(like moi) generally hate gazpacho or cold blends. Other notables, thus far: raspberry tuna dish(it actually works!), lobster salad, huevos estrellados, bass(Oprah-aaaaammazing, lol!), chorizo. The flan here is intricate and delicious.\n\nOne dish I hate here is the steak featured on the tapas menu. It tasted like mediocre sirloin... I admittedly--owing to its horrible texture--consider sirloin essentially dog food. I've never tried the paella but was informed that it tastes just like Spain's, which is not a good thing. To explain: paella(with or without saffron) is a stupid idea. Simply read the ingredients/preparation and you will sigh with comprehension... I call paella culinary meth, lol. If you insist on an entree the filet mignon(or I imagine any seafood or pork dish here) is a pleaser.\n\nImpeccable texture and taste overcome (merely above average) presentation at this spot--one of my faves for lunch or silly dinners. On my last visit, I enjoyed a quick bite/wine at the bar with friends. I have yet to try the early eve special but it sounds like a killer deal.    \n\n4 stars rather than 5 because some of the flavors repeat (a few dishes beg for drizzles; others for acidity to combat the olive oil and make things more spanish and less greek); however, I wish I could give 4.5 stars b/c they serve tender octopus And delicious fried calamari that doesn't even need the sauce or lemons."
0,"[First time Out-of-Towner for Spring Training]\n\nDon't believe the hype!!\n\nI could possibly never be allowed back for Spring Training, for saying that, but I wish someone would have warned me! Why does everyone talk about this place? Seriously, after our meal we all agreed Round Table is much better...and cheaper!\n\nWe arrived promptly at 11AM when the doors opened, to a stunned hostess, who didn't quite ready to see customers even though the door read \""Open @ 11AM\"". Sorry we are prompt, we had a lot to do that day...\n\nAfter more than 5 people said this was the place to try, we sauntered over here. It was going to happen on our trip, no matter what. Entering the place, it's cute...at best. White and red checkered table cloths, a full bar, and a visible pizza making counter.\n\nOur server was super sweet and very attentive, we were the only customers in there for about 30 minutes. I'm not sure how it would be if the place was packed, but lucky for us we didn't have to worry about it.\n\nThe menu is very limited. There are about 6 different salad options, but we all ordered the same one, the Caprese Salad. This salad was refreshing and well prepared. Huge slices of tomatoes and mozzarella, with basil leaves. The table comes adorned with oil and balsamic, so you can add as you please. This dish was on point and we all enjoyed this part of the meal.\n\nMaybe this is how they do it East coast style, so we aren't too familiar, but you get three choices of pizza and a pay for each topping you add...can you say rip off?!? You can choose between 1) Regular (red sauce), 2) White & Garlic, or 3) Pesto. I believe there were four different sizes: personal, small, medium, and large. Then each topping was charged per item. This is a baller-on-a-budget nightmare!\n\nIf the taste even came close to matching the price, it would have been decent. But the pizza was lacking in all things flavor and texture. I ordered a personal White and Garlic with chicken. The crust was so thin, it was super crunchy for my liking. The cheese they use was really rubber, no stringy cheese. The chicken didn't really have any extra flavor, it did not seem processed, which was a nice added touch. The others made their own personal sized pizzas, but no one  was impressed.\n\nThe size of a personal is huge, if I remember correctly its about 6 huge slices...which most other places that would be a small pizza. So, for portion size they get a high five, but a huge pizza with uninspiring taste didn't bode well with us.\n\nFinally able to try a cannoli, I ordered one for the table. Since I was devirginizing myself to this delicacy, I can't really comment too much on this. The Ricotta filling was good, the little chocolate chips were an added treat...but the pastry part was so hard, I could barely eat it with my fork. Like I said, I have no idea how this is supposed to look like, but it was too crunchy for my bones. I'll try it somewhere else, but I'm still on the fence.\n\nThe only reason I can see going here EVER, is the possibility of a Giants sighting. While we were there Jeremy Afeldt came in for lunch with a group, not my choice of sighting, but a Giant nonetheless :)\n\nI heard B. Wilson goes to Oregano's (Pizza Bistro)...just sayin'..."
0,"from its name, \""BRGR bar\"" sounds like a bar/lounge that sells specialty burgers. from the way BRGR treats its customers, it's a snobby expensive restaurant that turns away paying customers for no good reason.\n\nfirst time i went there, i came with a group of 7 people for dinner and drinks. we waited for about 30 or 45 minutes patiently waiting for our table (as other smaller groups got sat). then we saw 2 tables open up right next to each other and we asked if they could put them together.  they said NO, but couldn't give us a good reason why (they actually said they just couldn't move the tables). there was no one behind us in line. the only tables that could accomodate us were still eating and clearly wouldn't open up for awhile. the two adjacent smaller tables just sat empty for 10-15 minutes when finally, we got fed up and argued with them until they realized they had NO good reason for why they couldn't put the tables together and finally sat us.  it seemed like they initially didn't want to do it b/c they are too \""good\"" to move tables around to accomodate patrons.\n\nthe last time i went to BRGR, i tried to go there for drinks at around 9:30pm.  the restaurant area was mostly empty, 5-6 tables were open downstairs and who knows how many open on the patio.  no one was waiting in line.  we had a group of 4, but they refused to sit us because we only wanted drinks...they said we could sit at the bar (all the bar stools were taken). i said i \""might\"" get an appetizer, but they still wouldnt sit us. we asked when we could get a table for drinks, they said around 11:30 or 12am.  two other larger groups came in at the same time, wanting to just sit and drink, and they wouldn't sit them b/c they weren't ordering food.  those groups left.  my group left and went down the road to mad mex (funny thing is, i actually ended up ordering food).  \n\nanyways, management needs to realize that they are supposed to be the more casual counterpart of Spoon. probably never going back.\n\nfor the other stuff: \n-waitstaff service is good.\n-shakes are good.\n-the burgers are ehhhh and overpriced."
1,"I'm a huge Guerlain fan-boy.  Besides this store I also like the one at EPCOT.  This -may- be friendlier though with a slightly wider selection of the classics.\n\nIf you see Claire (who is awesome!), tell him Brian from Seattle sent you. ;)"
0,"Awful. Glasses were promised in 2 weeks instead of 1 hour, and they are 5 days late and still don't know where they are. They lie about when they will deliver and then string you along. Avoid them!"
1,"This is out first time in the windy city and we were told this was the place for steak and they weren't kidding. Made a reservation and was taken right on time. From the moment we sat down to the end of dinner it was like we were the only table this staffer had. The portions are very large so sharing is recommended. We had the surf and turf, lobster tail and porterhouse steak baked potato and Brussels sprouts. Perfect! We declined on appetizers and dessert. Ty for the great dining experience."
0,"Decided to come and eat here tonight just because I heard good things about this place. I must say that I was pretty disappointed.  \n\nFirst, we sat on the table and waited over 5 minutes for the server to come and one did because I finally called them.\n\nSecond, I ordered appetizers (fish taco and the wings) plus my dinner which is oxtail fried rice and oxtail pho.  My dinner came first before the appetizer.  The pho was warm (not hot) but \nit was good but a little salty.  The fish taco came with raw fish but wasn't mentioned in their menu.  The chicken wings good but nothing out of the ordinary.  The fried rice was probably the only thing good but then again nothing out of the ordinary.  \n\nThe server was nice and sweet.  She kept on checking to see if everything is okay."
1,"Mandalay Bay does not disappoint.  Although I always stay at this hotel, this past weekend we tried one night at Mirage and 2 at MB - let me tell you we were excited to come back 'home' to Mandalay!  Even the smell they pump into the casino is amazing...plus the casino is large and well lit, not very smoky at all\n\nPros:  Great rooms (flat screen TV in the bathroom, the best bath products) perhaps the most comprehensive selection of restaurants from fine dining to casual middle of the night and need baked potato soup spots, THE BEST pool in Vegas - and the bars are rockin.  Don't have any hesitation to book here - there is a tram that will take you to the Tropicana/Las Vegas BLVD intersection and from there you can easily get anywhere else on the strip.\n\nCons:  the worst cocktail service in the casino\n\nOverall - a great choice (make sure you check their specials, you can get a very reasonable rate here!)"
0,"I had the french toast platter and it was terrible!  Dry toast, bland eggs and under cooked bacon. Such a disappointing breakfast."
1,"I drove further than I'm willing to admit to try Aloha Snow.  A friend told me about the \""stuffed\"" snowcone they sell, so the kids and I had to try it.  The verdict?  Totally worth the drive!  \n\nLots of flavors to choose from (although very few sugar free) and the soft serve is awesome.  Layered together?  Heaven in a styofoam cup.\n\nUnfortunately, the shop itself is in need of a major spruce up.  It feels unloved, cluttered and in need of new paint and a good strong cleaning.  I found myself mentally refurnishing and decluttering the place while I ate, which proved to distract from the deliciousness of the cone."
1,"What can I say, this place isn't bad at all, in fact its actually really delicious but here's my pro/con list for you.\n\nAll the food: Delicious.  You cannot go wrong whatever you get.  Beef noodle soup, although not authentically Chinese, Taiwanese, Thai, Viet, is what i LIKE about it.  Anyone who calls this place \""non-authentic\"" is missing the point.  It's a fusion of lots of asian flavors, where you can find green Thai chilli in the same dish as fried chicken and noodles--but it works, so put your damn pinky down and take your fancy-flavor discriminating tongue somewhere else.  The Chang Mai curry is surprisingly a favorite among all my friends that have eaten there.  Oh did I mention BYOB? Yeah, awesome.\n\nNot so hot: Pork buns are $6 for 2.  Although tasty.. not worth it, but this is the only place where you can really get any in town.  If it were $4, I'd get them every time.  Also, the service is just a hit or miss.  I personally don't give a damn how you treat me as long as you bring my food out when it's hot and check back in a timely fashion.  One time, in a half empty house, slow service, my waitress with an attitude helped herself to an $8 tip on a $12 bill.  I treat anyone who handles my food with the utmost respect because frankly, I am scared of pubes and spit, but this strange service happens 30% of the time I go there.  Just carry exact change, bring a bottle of wine, and enjoy an awesome meal."
0,Wings were not good. Tasted very bland. Friendly service though. Not too many people here. TV was way too loud for the amount of people. Not sure how the 'family friendly' fits in: it's just another sports bar with blah food.

0,"NEGATIVE star!!!!!!!\nWe booked our vacation package through Orbitz 3 months ahead. At that time,Spirit  Airline had the most fitted flight schedule,so we picked it. But we were notified the flight we booked was cancelled and we had to fly out the following morning. We were force to accept it&booked an additional night stay at Vdara. When we arrived at airport, they told us our normal size carry-on luggage cannot fit on the overhead bin. We had to pay $35.00 for each luggage both way!!! Then we tried to check in online for our returning flight the night before...our flight time changed to a night flight! We were shocked co'z we had to get back to work. So I called Spirit Air ... I was on the phone for more than an hour trying to get help. First the rep from overseas told me the flight had been cancelled. But i knew it wasn't true since i checked on flight  schedule online. Then they told me there was an error, our flight is overbooked& they can't do anything about it. How about that?!?! Then I called Orbitz,waited for 24mins before I get to speak to a person. Elise the rep was nice but not helpful. She 3 way called Spirit Airline but nothing can be done. So...we were forced to changed our plan twice. Second time without any notification at all. Don't ever fly with Spirit Airline!!!!"
1,"There is ALWAYS a silver lining.\n\nI just want to say first that though Amy P.'s experience wasn't the best, you can always make lemons out if lemonade. \n\nMy bus yesterday had it worse off but ultimately had the best experience of everyone who had taken their buses earlier than me.\n\nWe arrived around 7:30am at the Info Center and the men who instructed us where to go did it in such a nice, humorous and very detailed manner that you couldn't get lost unless you didn't pay attention. After grabbing our wristbands and buying some water we headed out to our bus which acts on a first come, first serve basis. \n\nMy mom and I had decided to take the tour to Grand Canyon's South Rim and were actually the first bus to go. Everything was smooth sailing from our narrator to Hoover Dam to even our stop at Mickey D's. Everything was so pleasant until 2.5 hours into the bus ride.\n\nLemme tell you now that I have always had bad luck follow me, on this particular day it was supposed to rain for a start. \n\nOur bus' computer broke down and had to be re-started; a process which took a little less than an hour yet yielded no results. One backup bus was called which later had to be moved back on it's course so the company sent another bus. The bus was going to arrive in an hour. By the time it arrived we had sat in the bus for 2.5 hours.\n\nEveryone in the bus could have been irate and complained bitterly, but we didn't. The reason? Ryan, our amazing, superb and wonderful bus driver. Our bus driver was so calm, so collected that the mood of everyone in the bus was of great patience. He made our terrible predicament into an enjoyable time. \n\nAfter we switched buses, our hero, Ryan, told us that we were going to make lemons our of lemonade. He didn't lie about that. Sure, some people were not able to make their tours, but the pink jeep and the helicopter tours cancelled all their torus all day due to the bad weather. People who had booked these tours were actually okay with that. Everyone realized that it was the bus that broke down, not the fault of a single man and the company had been punctual to dispatch another bus for us.\n\nWe got to the Grand Canyon and before we reached the first viewpoint he told the bus that since we are the last bus arriving, we get 100% visibility. Apparently the buses before who arrived on time got 0% visibility due to the rain. We got there, it was 70 degrees, sunny and the clouds were clearing over a MAJESTIC scene. It was SO WORTH IT. Everything which had led up to seeing the Grand Canyon- the commentary, the scenery, the bus breaking down; it made finally seeing the Grand Canyon the most worth it sight. \n\nWe were able to see the Grand Canyon at sunset, the most beautiful time of the day and yes, you can't beat seeing it for yourself. \n\nOur ride back consisted of a 4-5 hour journey where pretty much everyone slept aside from the movie time. The only part I didn't like was our replacement driver, Mike who gave Ryan a break half way so he could go home. He should; it was already 12:08am and we arrived at our hotel around 1:30am. Mike was alright, but lacked the humor and patience that Ryan had. (This is probably why he drove the night bus since we're all sleeping.) \n\nIt was a crazy day. Like they say, life is about the journey, not the destination."
0,"It took three trips to Autozone to get my battery replaced that was under warranty. I even brought the print out from my mechanic's machine that stated the battery was bad. Michael, the manager, told me, \""I have been an ASE certified mechanic for 35 years and I know this is a good battery\"". He then told me I should have done a parasitic diagnostic test on the car to see what the problem was. However, I explained to him my mechanic had hooked my car up TWICE and each time it had diagnosed the problem to a bad battery.\n\nHe finally tested the battery again, and this time his machine showed it was a bad battery.\n\nI will not go to this Autozone again. Horrible customer service."
0,"This place doesn't deserve that one sad star.  It is, without a doubt, the most disgustingly neglected and poorly run hotel I have ever seen.\n\nThe visit started off on the wrong foot with the front desk employee telling us our reservation came in as smoking instead of non smoking, but that \""not to worry\"" because they \""aired our rooms out.\"" Clearly another guest had refused to stay in these rooms and he was trying to push them on us. Not the best customer service. \n\nOnce we got to the room, I fully understood what we had gotten ourselves into: the smell hit me abruptly. It reeked like someone's chain smoking grandmother's house and the door was wide open. While my husband checked to see that no unsavory characters lurked in the bedroom, I observed a filthy carpet, a dilapidated couch with numerous suspicious stains and an A/C unit with cigarette burns and ash all over it. The coverlet on the bed had what looked like blood stains and I have seen cleaner gas station bathrooms than the one in this \""suite\"".\n\nWe found another hotel, booked it, then asked for our money back from this dump. The front desk employee told us he would take care of it. When we called the website we booked with, they told us no one had contacted them. We followed up with the employee and he told us we had to call them ourselves, so we called back. The website said the hotel was responsible for issuing a refund. Finally a manager got involved and handled it, but it seems as though Quality Suites will do whatever they can to keep your money, including lying to your face. \n\nReading reviews across the internet, we definitely aren't the only people who have had this experience. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this $h!thole."
1,"Wisconsin Ave in DC was the first place/ time I ate at a Chipotle.  Primarily because it was a perfect place for lunch, located near a project I was working on and served healthy food, if you order correctly.  I ate there 3 times a week, so I must like it.  \n\nAnyway, I am happy to see that Charlotte finally has one in the area.  The place is fast food, which I normally avoid.  McDonald's formerly owned Chipotle with a majority investment in the chain, but do not let that discourage you as based on the quality at every other fast food Mexican place (e.g. Taco-Hell, Salsa-really-not, and even Moe's--which is not that bad) -- Chipotle is the Champ (Flaming Amy's in Raleigh bests it as that place is just cool).\n\nThey grill everything fresh and have an option for you health nuts called the Burrito Bowl, basically burrito ingredients sans the flour tortilla.  \n\nThe location on South Blvd fit what I excepted, as do most chains.  You order what you want on your burrito/ burrito bowl from beans, to meat (chicken, steak - lean steak, pork), to fresh vegetable toppings.  This is done ala Subway order line.  So, by the time you reach the end your food is ready to go.  I recommend getting a side of salsa and chips.  The chips can feed two and they are seasoned with Sea salt (I think) and Lime.\n\nIt is a great fast food place.\n\nLikes -\n. Lean steak\n. Fresh ingredients\n. Salt & Lime Chips\n.

1,"I love the Beatles and I loved Love! (...and all you really need is love...)\n\nI wanted to see Love for awhile. So, when my husband wanted to go to Vegas for a couple of days, I bought tickets. We were in the second section, which seemed perfect. But, as others have said, there probably isn't a bad seat in the house.\n\n I was completely mesmerized by this show. I think its one of the better Cirque shows I've seen, and the star of the show is definitely the music. Its a dizzying combination of effects, acrobatics, costumes, choreography and music.  \n\nI can't wait to go back and see it again!"
1,"This Small intimate space hosts a delightful and varied menu.  The six of us enjoyed every aspect of our meal.  The table d'h\u00f4te features soup or salad, a main course and dessert.  You can add an appetizer for $9.  My son in law started with venison tartare and declared it to be amazing.  I had bison short ribs for my main and I actually started salivating from the smell alone when the waitress placed the plate on the table.  The taste did not disappoint. Lest this appear to be only a game meat restaurant, let me mention that our friend, a vegetarian, asked the waitress what they could do for him and they brought a tower of pureed root vegetables on a bed of chickpeas, along with a variety of the vegetable sides that were featured in the meat dishes.  Madeleines for dessert and a very respectable espresso finished an excellent meal.  Bring your own wine.  Under $40 per person."
0,"Very disappointing.  My mom was having surgery at Meriter Hospital (a hop skip  & jump away from Chole's) and I called the day before to arrange an afternoon delivery.  (She checked in day of surgery.)  Even though I specifically requested and afternoon or early evening delivery, they called me at 10:30am and said there was no listing of her at Meriter.  I explained she was just checking in, and they guy told me \""no problem - we can deliver later\"" but sadly nothing had been delivered by 5pm.  When I called to follow-up,  was told that they had already been delivered.  I called a THIRD time around 7pm when I had been told they never arrived to reach a phone bank far away from Madison who had no idea what the status was...  \n\nThe following morning I called (a fourth time) to be told they would go out today, no apology.  The long and the short of it is that my mother did not receive her bouquet after coming out of surgery, and no one seems to care.  Horrible customer service.  I specifically used Chole's as I wanted to go with a local florist, and know they have been in Madison for decades, but I guess better to go with a 1-800-Flowers florist in the future?  Sad."

I recently replaced my windshield wiper and I was concerned that it didn't sit flush to the windshield.  When I went back I was told that it was due to the price (it wasn't the cheapest, but also not the most expensive), and was told that the windshield would need to meld to the window...ummm, not the best response."

Surly, rude ticket sellers combined with a theater kept too warm, and more popcorn on the floor than in the snack bar, all in all, not pleasant.  Someone needs to hose that place down!"
0,"I had high hopes for this place really, but they did not impress. I came here with my husband and ordered the green tea while he had chocolate. My green tea tasted like gum paste! My husbands however was delicious.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend you have a female make your ice cream instead of a male! My ice cream was half the volume of my husbands ice cream because the guy pounded the living life out of mine while making it. So much that there was no air incorporated into my ice cream and it came out as a nasty glob of paste! What a bummer!......he seemed like the owners son or something? He definitely looked like he has worked their for awhile. You would think he would know pounding the living life our of the mixture would make disgusting ice cream by now.....\n\nI probably will not be coming back, that ice cream was pretty nasty that I ended up throwing away my cup after three scoops."
0,"I was interested in checking out Arriba as I heard of the hot hatch chilies. Even after reading the mixed reviews we took s shot and headed over for dinner. \n\nChips & cocktails:  beer from tap was flat. Yup, flat. Don't see that everyday when going to a restaurant. Beer replaced with bottled variety.   Grande margarita ( house mix) was giant for $6 but I would have preferred my buddies flat beer. Nice size but nit very good and certainly not worth 1000 calories!!!    I drink a lot of slim-priced booze & was still not impressed. \n\nchips average, salsa bland, refried beans were the only added pleasure.  \n\nDinner:  my friend was not psyched with the cheese skin that arrived with his enchiladas. Creamy? yes, Shiny with weird skin?  Yes, Good?  No. \n\nCombo plate with green corn tamale was dry. Chicken enchilada was pretty good and seemed to have s lot of pepper seasoning. Thank god I asked for green sauce which saved the tamale. Rice and charro beans typical & moist. \n \nIn a nutshell, when should have taken heed from the yelp 2 star reviews.  Food was less than average. Much better quality, pricing and taste at Chipoltle."
1,"I was recommended Adam to paint the exterior of my house and was not let down. I received other quotes and Adam's quote was right there at the bottom for pricing but..that lower price didn't reflect in his work. The work was great, fast and they cleaned up well afterwards. I did my homework before choosing Life in Color and I would definitely recommend them."
1,"This definitely makes for a fun date night!\n\nI've been here twice now since it reopened as a dine-in theatre and have enjoyed each experience, although customer service was much better the second time around.\n\nBoth times we've gone, our movies have only been in the Fork & Screen theatres - looking forward to trying the next level up. \n\nThe last time I was there, we weren't able to make reservations online since we were paying with gift cards. So we got there early, enjoyed a drink around the corner at my fave bar - Merc. And then arrived 10 mins before previews started to order our dinner. It worked out perfectly. I ordered their brisket sandwich concoction - it's not even on the menu yet - and I was quite pleased with it. And my pomegranate martini was delish - a little on the sweet side - but that's what I prefer!\n\nThe previous time we went, we split their queso blanco dip w/chips and thai coconut chicken skewers. The chicken skewers were pretty good, but the queso dip was horrible. Tasted like your typical concession stand nacho cheese. So i would stay away from that.\n\nAll in all, I'm a fan and will be back soon!"
0,"If you like to be overcharged for so-so food, this is the place for you."
0,"Clearly these reviews are bogus. First, we get there in the middle of the day and the guy at the front desk is sleeping...in a bed they keep behind the desk...with the lights out. I asked him about the price differences on the confusing menu but he didn't speak English. We decided just to go for it and see what we got. There was no music and the adult daycare next door was having a party. My massage started but my friends didn't start for another 25 mins...though they said they'd do them at the same time. She got only a foot massage and I got a whole body. It was not relaxing because of the noise and the massage itself was okay at best. Don't believe he reviews on here!"

0,"My husband and I branched out to a new restaurant this weekend (Coronado Cafe in Phoenix) - our experience is why we don't like to branch out to new restaurants.  For starters, the host sat us and said \""we have a party coming in at 7pm; do you think you will be done by then?\""  After that warm welcome we found our water glasses had lipstick on them (both of the glasses).  We ordered the bruschetta (pretty good); my husband had the bacon/cheese burger and I had the meatloaf sandwich.  Burger was good, sandwich was very mediocre.  For the money and the food, we probably wouldn't go back.  The inside of the restaurant was very charming but that is about the extent of what impressed us."
0,"Don't bother. It's a waste of money. Service is mediocre. For a $ 255 massage, I would expect to feel on top of the world and not like I was just practiced on by a massage school student. And the maze of hallways and rooms that's just a confusing waste of space - lends to nothing relaxing."

0,"I was in Scottsdale with a group of women a few weekends ago for vacation and we booked a reservation at Distrito for brunch.  The weather was horrible all weekend so we were really looking forward to Brunch on Sunday before our flights left since the weather was finally nice.  There were 4 of us (all women, mid 30s, corp America Professional, dressed nice).  The moment we sat down our server had an attitude.  The restaurant was busy but nothing too terrible.  He made it very clear from the beginning that he didn't work the morning shift so I'm assuming he was called in last minute.  We were there for over 2 hours ordering foods and pitchers of margaritas and his attitude was so poor to us, that we would take turns for asking for something because he would basically yell at us when we did.  During this time, I saw a few people get up and leave before ordering food as well.  After 2 hours of the mental abuse, we got our bill which was well over 200 dollars, tipped 20 percent, and left.  However, I'm still just extremely upset about this.\n\nHere's the thing; we all have bad days, I understand that.  But that is no excuse to ruin someone else's day because of it.  My girlfriends and I had been planning and looking forward to this trip for several months.  I work very hard as well and this weekend was one of the very few days I've had had off in months.  It was our vacation.  He literally just ruined an enjoyable afternoon for my girlfriends and I for absolutely no reason at all.  Instead of us spending the afternoon catching up because we hadn't seen each other in YEARS, we spent it being scared to order more drinks, coffee, or food because our server was so mean to us.\n\nI just can't believe how horrible this experience was.  I want my vacation day back. =(\nThe only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is because their food and drinks are good."
1,"One of the best sandwich shops I've ever been to.\n\nThe sandwiches are actually as big as advertised, you can barely fit your mouth around them!  I highly recommend the Turkey and Avocado.  Friendly staff, a little pricey, but well worth it!"
1,"By FAR the best auto shop I've ever experienced.  This family-owned business is forthright about everything they do.  If there is something wrong with your car they will not only fix it they will provide you with the information necessary if there are other car issues related to the problem.  If there are no other problems, they don't try to scare you into additional services.  I am a single woman and have been going to this shop exclusively for 5 years now and will go no where else!!!!  You can trust your vehicle to Ketchums!  They always feel like an extended family to me."
0,"Customer service here is the worst I have ever experienced. I will not shop at Bass Pro again. I bought a gun and had to wait 3 days to pick it up. When I went to pick it up, you have to take a number to get waited on, I got my number and with one person in front of me, had to wait for over an hour to be waited on so I could get my gun. There were at least 4 people working behind the counter and most of what they did was talk to each other. I will shop elsewhere from now on."
1,Great place!! I'm a bit of a picky person and they made my order just the way I wanted it!! And even gave me a free dessert for my birthday!
0,"Couple of reviews on here saying how \""its better than paying more in the hotels\"" - that is true.\n\nLets say you went to college here - Friday/Saturday night, and you're making a 'quick' beer/liquor run for the girls back at the party waiting? Not happening. First, don't bring anybody who doesnt have an ID, they won't even sell it to you under suspicion you are going to be giving it to them. Well, yeah, who is going to drink a litre of their awful vodka by themselves - someone underage and who doesn't know any better.\n\nAll of this above is contingent on if you feel like waiting 30 minutes for their one checker that is open. That isn't a one off event. It is dissatisfaction guaranteed. Every time. You can expect to get hassled in this place each time, every time. \n\nOnce you do get your goods and make your way out of the place. You then get to deal with the bums, beggars, and hobos that try to hit you up for \""bus money\""."

I forgot. But eh, I wouldn't come here again."

0,"THIS IS FOR HAPPY HOUR ONLY...\n\nMcCormick's is a sold chian seafood restaurant.  I've dined here for full dinner several times and the food is typically well prepared, if unimaginative.\n\nHappy Hour runs Monday through Friday until 6:30pm with drink and food specials in the bar and front section of the restaurant.  We arrived at 6pm on a Fridayy night, and it was standing room only in the bar, but we were able to grab one of the \""happy hour\"" tables in the main dining room.  There are about a dozen items on the HH food menu, including a $2.95 half pound cheeseburger.  Prices range from $1.95 to $4.95.\n\nWe ordered fish tacos ($1.95 for 2), ceviche ($1.95), cheeseburger sliders ($4.95 for 3), sweet potato fries ($3.95), Ahi tostadas ($4.95), and steamed mussles ($2.95).  The fish tacos were two dry corn tortillas with one piece of blackened fish in each.  There was cabbage and tomato on the plate which we put on top.  They weren't terrible.  The ceviche has a thick tomato base and tasted more like ketchup than anything.  Mussels were stringy and chewy.  They looked dried out despite being cooked in a white wine broth.  The sliders were GREAT.  Soft rolls, grilled onions, cooked medium.  The Ahi Tostadas were also great; three peices of seared Ahi on fried wonton wrappers topped with purple cabbage and a sesame dressing.  Sweet potato friens are sweet potato fries.  They were hot, crispy and plentiful.\n\nThere were no liquor specials listed on the happy hour menu, only beer and wine specials.  I had a $5 champagne cocktail and hubby ordered a $4.50 beer.\n\nNext time, I think we'll stick with the things they seemed to do well, which are also the more expensive offerings.  The service was smooth and attentive.  The atmosphere is not high energy or exciting.  This is a place to eat and go, not to hang out and people watch or chat."
0,"Definitely gone downhill since my last visit. Enough so for me to finally create a yelp log in and wrote a review. I usually get the southwest chicken salad which is, or WAS I should say, amazing! They no longer carry it, or several of their other choice selections they once offered, so I settled on an old favorite, the vegetarian greifo. Unfortunately, it was lacking toppings since they've changed their ordering/service style, and skimpy on what veggies they did remember to put on. Pretty disappointed. Hate companies that rely on the gimmick of their name rather than actual product."
0,"R\u00e9servation pour un groupe de 12 pour un d\u00eener de No\u00ebl, la configuration des tables \u00e9tait \u00e9trange. Certains se donnaient dos. Le pain offert \u00e0 notre arriv\u00e9e est servi frais et chaud, il faut se retenir pour ne pas trop en manger. \nLa plus part des convives ont opt\u00e9 pour le sp\u00e9cial steak du midi. Les prix sont bas, mais tout s'explique quand le plat vient \u00e0 la table, le steak est miniature. J'ai eu la chance d'avoir le plus gros morceau. Pour 14$ un steak miniature avec salade et frites \u00e0 volont\u00e9. Oui, les frites sont bonnes et le steak \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bien cuit, tel que demand\u00e9 mais tout petit. J'aurais pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 payer un peu plus pour avoir un steak d'une grosseur d\u00e9cente. Une coll\u00e8gue a opt\u00e9 pour le saumon. Je croyais que le steak \u00e9tait petit, le saumon l'\u00e9tait encore plus. La serveuse justifie en disant que c'est la demi portion du midi... De quoi \u00e0 l'air la portion r\u00e9guli\u00e8re du soir alors... Une autre a pris la salade de ch\u00e8vrechaud, la laitue \u00e9tait molle.

1,"Caf\u00e9 Joe or Caf\u00e9 Slow as some call it is simply GREAT!  The food is delicious and inexpensive and I don't mind the slow service because I know what I'm getting into when I sit down. Plus, having time to sip your coffee and discuss with your friends without having a waiter rushing you is how brunches should be enjoyed!  Try to nab one of the picnic tables on a nice summer day. :)"
0,"I've come to the Nitty Gritty more times than I'd like to admit.  I've eaten here upwards of 5 times, and not one of those times have been remarkable in any way, shape, or form.  At best, the food is just okay.  \n\nIt's always teeming with loud partygoers, even in the restaurant.  This is too much for me when I'm just trying to eat food.  Thus, I wouldn't recommend it if you just want to eat food and are not celebrating yours, or someone else's birthday.\n\nThe very worst part is that you have to hear the \""Happy Birthday\"" song (not the one you're thinking of--a hellish variant) about 18 times while you're there.\n\nThe good parts?  Excellent (and I do mean excellent) drink specials most nights.  Prompt bar service.  Free mug with the year on it for your birthday (with all the beer or soda you can handle).  Pictures of past partygoers on the wall to snicker at."
1,"Fantastic dinner last night. Seared ahi tuna and calamari for apps, scallops and stuffed chicken for dinner. The food was very good. I expected to wait much longer than we did for food since the campus was flooded with marathon runners. In and out in about an hour. \nMy only complaint is with the service. Our waiter looked like he had just rolled out of bed and was annoyed he had to work. By the end of the meal we were finally able to get one smile out of him. \nWill definitely be back!"
0,"My wife and I had a stay scheduled at the Venetian and decided to come into town a night early and check out the Stratosphere as it was part of the Southwest Rapid Rewards program. Upon arriving in our room, we quickly noticed a strong odor of cigarette smoke in the room. We had specifically requested a non-smoking room when booking and confirmed this with the front desk while we were checking in. The bathroom also scored failing points as the toilet seat wouldn't stay up. This might sound like a minor thing, but it's not. As a man, I had to hold the seat up with one hand so it wouldn't fall down on me as I was going #1. Additionally, the walls of our room were paper thin, so we could hear our neighbor's conversation word for word (they also were disappointed with the room).\n\nShortly after checking in, we headed up to their Top of the World rotating restaurant where we had made reservations and were meeting another couple. From the moment we sat down, we felt that the server (Rebecca H. according to my receipt) was in a rush to get us out the door. We came for fine dining and I wasn't even asked if I wanted a drink before dinner. Truly astonishing! When it came time to receive the check, we asked Rebecca if she would split it by couple. She didn't even try to hide how frustrated this made her. She was able to split it, but not after making a production about how she had to go \""look into whether or not this could be done.\"" Give me a break. Our table had spent nearly $400 in total on this dinner. A real restaurant would have asked us if we wanted the check split before printing it out.\n\nAs for the food, my wife and I both ordered the filet. I thought it was average and she thought it was slightly below average. My advice: check out the observation deck (free for hotel guests) but skip dinner here. It's nothing special.\n\nAfter dinner, we headed over to the Bellagio to gamble and drink for the remainder of the evening and early morning. We returned to the Stratosphere at approximately 4am. From the front door, we had to walk the length of the casino to get to the north elevators. We had dressed up for the night. I was in a suit and my wife was wearing a classy, shorter cut dress. As we passed through the poker room, there was only one game going on which wasn't surprising given the hour. As we passed this table, I immediately began hearing heckling aimed at my wife coming from the approximately seven men playing at this table. The phrase that sticks out in mind is \""she's gonna take it tonight.\"" Of course, it's also hard to forget the sexual grunting and moaning sounds that we were also treated to. As I looked back at the table, they began to actually mock me with chants of \""oh look, he's getting mad now!\"" What upsets me more than these comments themselves was that neither the dealer or the poker floor manager who was standing nearby said a word to the players. I doubt that this heckling technically broke any hotel or casino rules, but they certainly broke the rules of common decency. I own a business and if I learned that two of my employees sat idly and let this go on without saying a word, I would have been furious and the employees would have been reprimanded and/or fired on the spot. It was so disrespectful to us as customers and to my wife as a woman that neither employee had the guts to say \""calm down guys\"" or \""those type of comments aren't appreciated here\"".\n\nWhen we got back to the room, I called the front desk and they transferred me over to the poker floor manager who we had previously walked by. After telling him what we had happened, he told me there were two poker games going on and that I would have to give him a description of the dealer so he could determine which was the problem table. This was an outright lie. There was only one game going on. I decided that was enough on the phone and walked down to the front desk. Here I was, a paying hotel guest who had also spent over $200 at dinner in the hotel earlier in the night, standing at the front desk at 4:30am. I spent about 20 minutes talking with the night manager who \""would be just as upset\"" if he was in my position but \""men will be men especially in Vegas\"". In the end, I wound up with free breakfast and a late checkout.\n\nFor what it's worth, the breakfast sucked. My stomach didn't feel right for the entire rest of our trip. The moral of the story: you get what you pay for! We'll never step foot in this place again."
0,"I'm so surprised to read all the good reviews as I just had a pretty bad meal. The appetizers were amazing but it seems like they promote them and then sell them at half price in happy hour to make sure the locals come in and have a good time drinking and snacking. We had the calamari and sashimi ahi tuna - both were very good, especially the tuna. We then ordered lobster ravioli (i've had better from Fresh and Easy) and a filet. The filet wasn't bad but I know packet mashed potatoes when I eat them and these were absolutely, 100%, packet mixed mash. I was so surprised after such good appetizers. I wouldn't normally say anything but I just couldn't help it. The chef didn't come out, all I got was \""oh no, they are definitely freshly made, I eat them every day\""\nSorry but I won't be back and I can recommend much better locals restaurants which are much cheaper. I just feel sorry for the guests staying there who know no better"
0,"Well let me tell you. We  have stayed here twice before and had a very nice stay. This time was so different!   We got here no problem with check in. Got a good deal for staying here before. Paid a low price for one night, second night free. When we got to our room...very nice until I smelled smoke. I called the front desk to complain that I specifically asked for a non smoking room and there was an obvious smoke odor. She told me no problem will send someone to spray room to purify smell. That took 1 1/2 hours for someone to do that who was spraying for 5 seconds then leaves. It did help but we could still smell faint odors of smoke. At this point I didn't want them to come back to use an air purifier if the sprays didn't help. Had a great evening with my husband eating out and having fun...here in town to celebrate our 22nd anniversary.  Next morning,  left the room at 10 am, went out for the day, come back @4pm so we could get some rest then get ready to go to the top of the world restaurant and celebrate our anniversary.  We notice the need service sign we put on the door when we left was still there. We walk in and no one has come to clean our room! Very upset at this point.  I call and complain again...seriously  we were gone 6 hours and our room wasn't even cleaned? ???? I feel that is more than enough time for some one to clean up our room. I told them..forget it! Just bring me towels and toiletries...and someone actually came by in 10 minutes. What upsets me the most is that no one showed any care or concern. .they were just so matter of fact. No one said Sorry!!! I ended up canceling our reservation at the top of the world restaurant.  I spoke with Will who was the only one who gave me his name without asking,  offered to give me a later reservation and actually cared! I just said no thanks just need to cancel. I have been to the top of the world restaurant twice before and the staff and food were fabulous!  After all is said and done. ...what matters most is that I'm here in Las Vegas with my best friend and hubby of 22 years....just have to make the best of it. One thing for sure, will never stay at the Stratosphere again!"
1,"It's still good; this time for champagne brunch.  The champers is awful and will most certainly give you a headache, but cut with oj it's not bad.\nIf they have the Mexican been/cheese/egg conglomeration you'd be a fool not to get it.  It was great."
1,"Great smoothies, 24 hours with drive through!  Perfect for Summer in Vegas.  Great with a carload of kids or pets in the car but there WILL be a wait.  I love this place but would love it EVEN MORE if it was faster.  :)  Try the Mango Madness.  My favorite!  The add ins are fantastic and turn your smoothie into a meal with protein, immunity, etc.  A must have in a hot desert city!  Wish they had other sizes available."
1,"I agree with Soheila, all L&Ls are not created equal. They may have the same name, and may have to follow the same recipes but it doesn't mean that they all use the same cooks nor do they cook things the exact same way, they SHOULD but they don't. Fortunately for me, I enjoyed my experience at this location.\n\nWe ordered the healthy plate, garlic shrimp salad and the short ribs plate with shrimp and an extra side of Mac salad. The plate was OK. Not sure if we'd order it again, or at least without the shrimp we chose. The shrimp was breaded and it seemed like there was more breading than shrimp. But the salad and the shrimp was SO good! \n\nI always knew this place was here but never had the chance to eat here, glad we did, I enjoyed my lunch that day ;)"
1,"Good solid car wash, polite employees.  They scrub down your car before it goes through the automatic wash, then they towel dry and wash the tires which was nice.  Also have free vacuums you can use after or before you do the wash which is killer.  Only 4 stars because it's CASH ONLY."

I asked if she can let the other members of my party know where I am sitting upon their arrival. She said oh I wouldn't be able to know who they are, so I can't. \n\n???!\n\nThat's just horrible. Other hostesses in other restaurants will make sure to get my name and lead other members of the party to the table. \n\nI hope corporate reads this. Her name is Caitlyn or Katelyn. I'm not sure, but this occured at 9:45am today."
1,"If you want to service your car, ask for Jeff! I recently bought a red 2008 Honda accord V6 coupe and had the check engine light on with code P0497: EVAP system low purge and had been experiencing a little jerk from 1st to 2nd gear. Jeff rode with me to diagnose the problem carefully and he really really knows what he is talking about. In addition, I also experienced a weird popping noise from the ceiling and was having trouble figuring out what it is for almost a week, and Jeff was able to spot the problem within a minute! I highly recommend him as your trusted mechanic. He listens and symphasize with you on your problems. And he is very knowledgeable, professional and easygoing. This is not your average service guy. He is awesome! Also, I recommend anyone who takes their cars for service do a little research ahead. That way you will know if someone is ripping you off. Jeff certainly is very honest because everything he said was pretty much what my research indicated."
0,"My hatred for this walmart burns with the fire of a thousand suns.   The ONLY saving grace of this craphole is that they carry quite a bit more inventory than some of the other walmarts.\n\nThere are always employees everywhere but where you need them.  There's a multitude of them milling about the store, except in the paint section, the camping/ammo section, the cash registers...you get the drift.\n\nAnd, while my expectations aren't terribly high as it's a Walmart, holy white/black/brown/olive trash Batman!  They should just go ahead and put in a meth section and make a few extra bucks.\n\nIt's dirty, it smells, the customer service is nonexistent, and you have to wade through the tweakers, but it's cheap and they have a lot of stuff."
0,"A good BYOB if you're a big group. The restaurant is so massive that they can sit pretty well any size group anytime. Also, they don't ask you leave after you're done, so you can keep on drinking.\n\nBy no means is this a bad place, I just tend to gravitate towards places with really amazing food. L'academie is reasonable food and a reasonable price, not some place I'd go if I'm looking for a special night out."
0,This was the most over rated restaurant I have ever dined at.  The food was just OK. Actually the pretzel rolls were the best part of the meal.  My husband's lemon sole was over cooked and his clam chowder was just ok.  I had the tomatoes and buratta cheese.  The cheese was very good.  My lobster tails:  one baked and one in a vanilla batter were both over cooked.  We shared the Butter Cake which was good but not spectacular.  Along with this our service was horrible.  We had to ask for bread which eventually came had no butter with it.  We had a different person for each course and were totally ignored in between.  In the meantime a woman manager in a business suit and the waiter were busy fawning over the people at the next table.  Eat at Sinatra's if you want a first class meal and exceptional service.\nRenee P.
1,"My breakfast burrito was unreal. It was the size of a football (and not a burrito, which seems to be a trend in CLT. You're supposed to wrap the whole thing, burritos aren't open faced...) and had me full until dinner.\n\nI really didn't eat lunch, not out of any attempt to starve myself mind you, I was so full that it never occurred to me. And it was tasty too! the sausage had great flavor that really permeated the beast."
0,"I have attended this club sporadically since it opened sometime in 2010. It has had its up's and down's in terms of basic club/bar service, it may depend on what night you attend.  My main complaint is that If you ever need to contact someone of authority at this club, (don't even bother.) But say you Lost/left something behind at the club? Had and altercation with a bouncer? Were double charged by the bartended on your credit card?  Have a complaint? Have a compliment?  The staff is uncooperative and rude no matter what your situation is.Id stay away from this club, there are other bars and clubs that cater to the same patrons. I always feel welcomed to spend my money everywhere/anywhere else in Phoenix."
0,"This place has really gone down hill! I ordered 2 pizzas and when I went to pick them up, one was burned. They said they could redo but after 15 minutes they said it was ready and the pizza was not even cooked through. I had ordered ravioli there too and the pasta was doughy and sauce was burned. You should avoid this place at all costs. Their answer to a complaint is \""we'll give you a free 2 liter bottle of coke.\"" No manager or any idea of what customer service is!"
1,"My girlfriend, her sister and I decided to visit Bella Luna for a nice dinner. Our first impression was it was a small, nicely decorated restaurant. From the get-go, we were kindly greeted by the owner, seated promptly, and cared for right away. Our server, Nicole, was such a great host! She took care of us quickly but still gave us enough space to feel like were not being rushed. \nWe had the Bruschetta as an appetizer, which was delightful and so fresh. \nOur main courses were fantastic. I had the Angel hair pasta with shrimp, my girlfriend enjoyed her egg plant parmesan and to be honest I can't remember what her sister ordered but it was delicious as well. \nWe ended the night with NY style cheesecake and it certainly hit the spot. \nMy impressions of any restaurant are greatly influenced by customer service. Good food is obviously a must I care so much more about being treated well and being taken care of. Bella Luna did both for us. \n\nWe normally don't visit the same restaurant twice since we enjoy trying new places. But we will be back!"

The wrap was cut in half. The first half was delicious. The bread was extremely soft and tasty. The two face 2nd half was drowned in its own wrap juices and completely nasty."

The place is really small compared to other yogurt places we've visited and they only had about 7-8 flavor choices.  Their toppings bar wasn't much better in terms of selection.  Like Dave said, if you're in the area, you're better off visiting Yogurtology or Sweet Republic."

0,"Friendly staff and all but the bathroom was rundown and the wife lifted the slip around the mattress and the mattress was streaked, skanky and old.\n\nI had two girls with me and so we needed extra towels but the housekeeper in the hall told me \""I need a towel from you to give you a towel but anyway we don't have any extra so I can't help you.\"" So I walked down to the fitness center and grabbed two towels and the housekeeper looked at me and I looked back at her and i just squeezed by lol.\n\nFunny another reviewer mentioned a flying beetle in the room, we had one of those, too! I got rid of it myself, though lol.\n\nAlso, they have the bistro setup, I just don't like those at all. To get coffee, you have to buy it from the 'bistro' instead of the free coffee setup Courtyard used to have. \n\nFor those of us that are Marriott-loyal, I think the Fairfield Inns are better value. They are just as comfortable, the beds and pillows are just as good- which is really all we care about- breakfast is free, and they tend to be newer."

1,"For years now, I have been telling my boyfriend about my hopes and dreams in life.  One that kept coming up, time and time again, was that I wanted to hug a penguin someday.  I was resigned to the fact that this would never happen - where on earth would I possibly be able to hug a penguin?  Antarctica?  Not going there.  Zoos - yeah, they have gates separating me from the huggable waddlers.  So it was just another dream destined to never come true - until my 26th birthday when my boyfriend presented me with two tickets to the Penguin Encounter at the National Aviary.\n\nI was so childishly excited when we arrived at the Aviary one Saturday.  We were early for the penguin encounter, so we explored the rest of the Aviary first.  I was surprised at how delightful and interesting it was - yeah it's just birds, but like - who knew birds could be so cool?  It's essentially a zoo for birds, which sounds boring, but it is not!\n\nMy favorite part (besides the penguins) was going in the tropical habitat room.  This trainer gathered up a big crowd of us and did a feeding demonstration which was awesome.  Only kids got to be participants - well, it was an unspoken rule, but how dumb would I look standing up there with a bunch of 5 year olds - so that was a bummer.  But wow - watching these kids throw a grape in the air and this beautiful multicolored bird swoops down to catch it.  Birds were rushing past me so fast I felt a breeze by my ears.  The air was just buzzing with life, and the trainer was really knowledgeable and gave us a great, interactive show.\n\nWhen it was time for the Penguin Encounter, i was thrilled to hear that we were the only two signed up that day.  Technically as many as 8 people can do it at a time, and I would've been so furious if there were 6 dumb kids getting all up on my penguin time, but fortunately that was not the case.  We were brought to a classroom, and sat on some low benches close to the ground.  We heard some weird honking sounds coming from behind a partition.\n\nA few minutes later, a trainer (Chris, I think?) came in, and opened a door to a little cage where our new penguin friend Elvis had been hiding.  Apparently he had been honking to alert us to his presence, and perhaps to ascertain whether or not we were also penguins (nope).  Elvis waddled around us for a while, rather disinterested, but he LOVED his trainer.  He kept plummeting into Chris's lap in this really hilarious way, flapping his wings with the sheer delight of being so close to his buddy.  To keep him still, Chris had to put a hand on his beak, and then Elvis chilled out enough for us to be able to pet him.  He was feathery, not surprisingly, and a very cute little guy.  Whenever Chris let go of him, he'd just sort of wander around and sometimes start heading away from us until Chris would go \""hey!  where do you think you're going?\"" and he'd waddle back.  Chris told us lots about penguins while Elvis tolerated our attention.\n\nAfter a while, Chris put Elvis on a table and we got to take some pictures with him.  I still hadn't gotten my penguin hug, so at one point I moved in a little closer to Elvis and he sort of tried to beak my face, as if to say \""back it up lady, we just met!\""  Learned that penguins don't really like to be hugged, and they mostly just tolerate being petted (unless you are their beloved trainer).\n\nAfter the photo op, we went outside with Chris and watched him put Elvis back in the penguin enclosure.  We watched him swim around in a showoffy manner for a while before we left.  It was a SUPER cool thing to be one-on-one with a wild animal (and an adorable one at that), but sadly my dream of hugging a penguin is not yet realized.  But maybe I should stop wanting wild animals to be like house pets, and just be content that I got to pet him at all!\n\nSuper fun day - definitely recommend the Aviary in general, and the Penguin Connection if you are a fan of the silly creatures!"
0,"Sadly this is a shadow of its former self. So much has gone downhill -- except the prices -- that this once outstanding spot is now a to-be-avoided tourist trap.\n\nA simple meal for two will cost about \u00a3200 with wine but the service will be about what you'd expect of a nando's. Different servers and indifferent other types pop by the table about once every thirty minutes whether you need something or not. \n\nThe Sommelier poured about 200ml in my glass, which I had to send back. The starters were still a good 20 minutes away. \n\nIn short: food tasty but overpriced. Service worst I've ever seen at this price range."
1,"Postrio is located at the Venetian's Grand Canal Shoppes, Postrio presents a menu of seasonal, modern American cuisine with global influences that can be enjoyed on the casual, \""indoor\"" patio overlooking the Carnivale atmosphere of St.  Mark's Square or in the modern dining room.  A sleek, bronze-paneled bar extends into the caf\u00e9 and a row of sophisticated leather booths are set within tile \""cabanas,\"" forming an intimate lounge along the bar. \n\nI was here two times for group business dinners during a recent trade show convention. The first time was a rather large group of about 80 people, while the second time was a smaller group of about 25 people. The organic baby kale salad with artichoke, spring onion, baby carrots and feta cheese was very nice. In fact the quality of the feta cheese was very unusual.\n\nBoth times I ordered the steak entre and both times I was very pleased with the quality of my steak and the table service here. I know that serving a large group is very difficult. I would return for a regular dinner here."

1,"Reading the bad reviews for Zumanity made me want to right a great review.  I would gladly go see this show again, even though I know everything that will happen.  We went on our honeymoon and that show was a ridiculous amount of fun!  The performers are also extremely gracious.\n\nIf you are offended by tits, dildos, huge packages, fake fabric penises, etc.--just don't go.  Of COURSE there was crude humor.  It was raunchy!  AND FUN!\n\nThe costumes were great, the humor kept us laughing, and the acts were great!  Props to the fishbowl girls who didn't bust their faces open on the glass.  I was literally terrified that they would!  But Cirque du Soleil performers are amazeballs--end of story.\n\nGo.  It's not a waste of money.  If you don't believe me, buy from the half-price ticket booth set up near New York New York."

1,"Shared the tasting menu which was a lot of food, and all of it great, although expensive.  If you're looking for authentic Japanese fare, this isn't the place for you.  But the flavor combinations worked if you're up for some experimenting.  Place was fun and festive and our well-behaved, Japanese food-loving kids (6 & 9) enjoyed it too.  Went at 6:30p which was perfect because it was busy but not full.  Service was very attentive even if his pronunciation of the Japanese menu was off."

0,"For the price and quality. I've had better.\n\nWhen I go to a Mexican Restaurant, I like to try their lengua (tongue) because it's how I can tell if they put thought and effort into their cooking. \n\nThe Lengua at Roberto's is flavorless and greasy. I've had better in Los Angeles. \n\nThe positive note with Robertos is their burrito contents. They will give you a burrito filled with meat. So filling... but flavor, it's lacking."

0,"I can't seem to understand 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality, its one of the worst I've ever been in, and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez, Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day.\n\nYes, Majerle's is worse.  \n\nOkay, well, no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul, but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of Hell.\n\nThe set up is terrible.  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS (!) at one time, they are both showing the same game.  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games.  \n\nMoreover, i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch.  \n\nThe bar is always crowded, which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food.\n\nI wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at Sports Illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top 1,000 sports bars in the US."
0,"Went into get my brows waxed and was dissatisfied. The lady who did them was very rushed, like I was bothering her and she needed to do something else.

1,"When I have wads of cash to blow (really never, let's be honest) on clothes and knick knacks, this is the place I turn to. With all the beautiful selections, I can never go wrong! Sometimes, I think the clothes are actually \""too\"" pretty for me, (apparently I am a twelve year old boy when it comes to keeping my clothes clean) but regardless, the selection is great. Flowing skirts, floral tops, and lace stockings are just a few of my favorite things here. I also enjoy the random books. I picked up my first edition of Post Secret here, among other now popular coffee table books. If you enjoy candles and kitchenware, they also have a nice array. Here is my one piece of advice: The same company owns Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters, so before you omit to a piece, check and see if it is offered at a lower price at Urban. I have found a few things on sale there and regular price at Anthropologie, but it is rare. If you do decide to stop in, make sure you have some time (and some dough) to spend, because it could take all afternoon to browse!"

0,"Worst service EVER for large parties. We had a party of 12 in celebration of my father in law's 50th birthday. We ordered our food and it took over a hour and a half for it to come out!!! I'm sorry but that's just terrible. Every time we asked the waiter about our food he said \""Oh, it will be out in a few minutes\"". We watched every table around us eat their food and leave before we even got our food. These parties were anywhere from 6-10 people so I don't understand why it took so long for 12 people. \n\nThe food itself was nothing impressive either. The best part about the dinner was probably the Indian fry bread. Everything else was edible.\n\nWe will definitely never be eating here again."
1,Loved the atmosphere! It was dimly lit but not so dark that you couldn't see where you were going. The staff was very attentive and very friendly. The ambience was swank and chic but there were no stuck-up or snooty people to be found and that's exactly how I like it! The food wasn't amazing but it was tasty and I am definitely going to return. This is a great place for a date. My girlfriend and I saw many other couples dining that evening. I would also bring friends here that are visiting from out of town as well!
1,My husband and I love this place!  Their salads are great and are large in size. You can dine inside or drive through if you are in a hurry. The staff is always friendly.  We eat here at least once or twice a week and we don't get bored.

First, we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten, which they sort of honored. At least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived.\n\nOur waitress was the only shining star - she did a good job of taking care of 9 people with 7 separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled. She was also helpful in getting a couple of the TV's switched over to the Panthers game (they lost).\n\nWe had a few appetizers for the table. The pretzel \""bones\"" were good, served with a couple of different sauces, as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces. If you like cheese fries, try the Fire Stix which were the best part of the meal.\n\nHaving read the reviews, I knew to stay away from the brisket. I went with a \""lunch\"" sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast. It was dry and not much more than warm. After we asked, the waitress brought out the bbq sauces, which improved the bland taste. The \""fire roasted corn\"" was good - a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty. The mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well, especially when I mixed it with the corn. ;-) Both sides were too small and my friend sitting next to me got an even smaller undersized scoop of potatoes with his salmon.\n\nWe didn't have dessert. They added 18% gratuity to the check, which was understandable for the size of our group.\n\nWould I go back? No, I don't think so."

0,"I've been having a hard time finding great, greasy Chinese food in Phoenix. I have my favorite spots in Tempe, Scottsdale and even Tucson, but in Phoenix I've had no luck. It's funny, I'd expect Phoenix proper to have the best Chinese food out of at least the metro area. But no luck. Uhh well. \n\nAnyways, The Golden Phoenix looked like it was going to be a winner. Good decor and ambiance for a Chinese food restaurant, large menu, great reviews and located in a strip mall (that's where all the best ones are, I'm sure of it).  Sadly, it wasn't as big as a hit as I had hoped.\n\nAmbiance: Great for a chinese good spot\nTake-Out Service: Eh. I called it in, they said it would take 15 minutes but it ended up taking about 25. When I walked in I was given a cold look by the waitress and pointed to the hostess stand. This could have been because I was wearing sweatpants and a baggy tee, but in my defense,  I had literally just gotten a root canal. Who dresses up after a root canal? \nPrice: Pretty fair. $20 for an appetizer, soup and main dish. \nFood: Crab puffs: DELICIOUS. Perfect texture.  Soup: Not what I expected, but pretty good. I got the egg drop soup. Main Dish: I am a vegetarian so I got the black mushroom and bean curd dish. I think my ordering skills may have been the problem because who orders a dish of all mushrooms? It tasted, well... really, really mushroomy.  And not in a good way. It was kinda gross. I couldn't finish it. I know this doesn't make sense b/c I ordered a mushroom dish so I should expect a mushroom taste,  but there was some kind of funk going on. And there were no other flavors in the dish, just mushroom funk. The tofu, however was cooked well. \n\nOverall, the meal was alright, but kind of a disappointment. I feel this may have been my fault for ordering such a weird dish, so to be fair, I will try it again and let you know what I think. \n\nJust learn from my mistakes, don't order anything mushroomy."
1,"My partner and I had our first trip with some friends to the Mellow Mushroom, and I am incredibly sad that we have not stopped in before.  I have been on a quest to find amazing pizza in Charlotte, and I can say that this place has the best pizza I've eaten so far.\n\nWhat makes their pizza so amazing, you might ask?  First off, their crust is scrumptious!  It's part whole wheat, and it has a great, chewy texture.  The wheat gives it such a great flavor.  And secondly, they have such a plethora of toppings you can add.  You can get several different types of cheeses, meats, veggies, and even fruit.  I've got to say, that's pretty wicked awesome.  Finally, at certain times of the day, you can get pizza by the slice.  And I'm not just talking about one tiny slice - the slices are giant!  It's like eating a quarter of a large pizza (well, not quite, but you get my point, I hope).  And it's not just some pre-made slice, you can choose what toppings you add to your pizza.  What a stellar idea!  They have several vegetarian options, and they even have a selection of gluten free pizza offerings too!  \n\nBesides pizza, they have appetizers, salads, and even calzones.  They also have a large selection of beers, and apparently you can join their beer club to get rewards.  How awesome is that?\n\nAnd in addition to great food, the decor is all trippin' in there.  They psychedelic theme permeates the tables, walls, and bar area.  They even have an old hippie bus all decorated up, with booths you can sit at in there.  We had great service there, and our server was so enthusiastic.  Their prices are a little higher than other pizza places, but the quality is outstanding.  And if you get pizza by the slice, you can get a large slice with multiple toppings for less than $5.  It's very filling.\n\nOh yes, I will definitely be back here."

Meh.\n\nHere are some observations:\n- The homeless drunks still find a way on the bus at 8AM.\n- Each driver has their own interpretations of where the route goes, which neighborhoods are flag-stops, bus capacity, etc. Those interpretations almost never err on the side of good customer service.\n- Why so many fuckwads that spend 10 minutes waiting for a bus, only to get off at the next stop? It's a 5 minute walk. Stop slowing the bus down!\n- The bus capacity is listed as 17 seated + 6 standing, and usually somewhere between 23-30 passengers will be on the bus as it approaches ASU, depending on the mood of the driver. It is never under max capacity. I have seen literally hundreds of people not get picked up over the past two weeks. They could use full-size Valley metro buses and they would still fill up.\n\nSo, one star because I can't give it zero, plus one more because it's free. Though you get what you pay for."

They are ready to do what it takes to keep their customers happy. Your coffee cup is kept full. If your waiter or waitress is not there to fill your cup someone else passing by with coffee is. You can get bacon, eggs, two pieces of toast, and hash browns for $2.99. Why would anyone in the area go anywhere else? Everything always comes out tasting good,"

1,Saved our bacon and showed up quickly after we called for commercial services. They were able to fix the problem the 1st time unlike the company we used before (who didn't fix it). I will gladly refer this company to anyone who needs a plumber. Thank you for fixing our crappy situation! Literally!
0,"I went in and had a root touch up, while it was nice, there were some things that really bothered me. After rinsing the dye out I had some smeared on my forehead. I assumed that the hairdresser would remove it, but he let it sit there until he was done and I asked to have it removed. It didn't come all the way off and I spent three days scrubbing at it. Not exactly a professional job. Also, when he was styling my hair (which is curly) he only used a brush and blow dryer to straighten it, no flat iron, which would have been ok, but he said something about how he was allowed to use the flat iron and I thought that was weird. I ended up having the wash and style my hair again when I got home because it was frizzy and there was a lot of dye left on my scalp."
1,"This is another one of those little specialty gift stores that stock sets  apart. It is truly any plant lover's dream. They don't actually sell plants here except on rare occassion, but they have artisan fountains, organic plant foods, seeds that have been harvested right here (and are therefore pretty likely to flourish with the right care), cards / notebooks, and some of the harder to find gardening tools. All perfect for gift giving or when you feel like treating yourself to a new retracktable rake!\n\nIf you have ever tried to seriously grow plants in the Phoenix area, you have already figured out that our region has a unique set of obstablcle..... er, ummm, opportunities. This store is dedicated to providing you with the information and tools that you need to make this process as painless as possible. And while you are at it, why not make your garden feel like it is really an extension of your home with some personal touches.\n\nNow you might think that because they are a specialty shop that the prices would be on the higher side, and although there is the occassional eye-brow lifting price tag, for the most part, items are reasonably marked considering that the majority of things are not mass produced and have been hand crafted by artisans. The staff are always friendly and helpful. If you don't see something, just ask and they will either get it for you or suggest other local options that may be fruitful (pun intended).\n\nRemember to check out the bulletin board and counter by the register for upcoming events. They often host book signings, demonstrations, or lectures on... yeah you guessed it Southwestern Gardening. They also offer several different classes throughout the year that focus on the more artsy side of things, such as fused glass, silk painting, etc.\n\nSouthwest Gardener is located on the corner of Thomas and 15th Ave in a little strip mall right next door to the Original Hamburger Works.\n\nhttp://www.southwestgardener.com/index.php"
0,"We tried several things for lunch (brisket, pulled pork, chicken, chili, beans, mashed potato salad) because we were hoping to find our new go-to eating place. I liked the brisket but that's where the praise ends. Food tasted overly smokey and lacked seasoning. It was also a bit pricey but the portions were large. It's a cute place with lots of charm, everyone was friendly and we really wanted to like it. We might give it another chance in the future - just in case they were having an off day."
1,"Thinking about Vanity only brings back good memories. I m not sure if its my first time being featured on spyonvegas : ( http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs337.snc3/29443_116064648437529_100001019834956_93498_5217344_n.jpg) Or looking back at all those suckahs waiting in line from the escalator as I was heading in there. I remember a grenade in line ran her mouth and was like , \""Oh I guess this club only needs more dicks, but less chicks\"" Yes we need more dicks as long as we don't get blown off by grenades. Anyway on to my Vanity experience. \n\nWe got in way early at around 11'ish and the bottle service servers/go go dancers were abundant and standing around waiting for what the night has to offer. One of the things that caught my eyes wasn't how hot the dancers/server girls looked in their corsets, panties and stockings, but how they all matched. When all the girls have matching outfits, it definitely gives the club an appeal that there are hot girls all over the place. I came in and I got the feel that this place just plain sexy. \n\nWithin minutes I have already completed my walk through. So this was no mega club like Tao/ Haze or XS. However it does pack a punch with every little nook and crany. I can't imagine seeing one spot in the club where its not lit up with some high tech LED lights. The roof of the dance floor lights up according to the music being played. I m glad I noticed this before I got too wasted. \n\nI spent most of my night talk to Kori, Yumi, Brie and her friends in the outside patios. On Friday it got a little bit too crowded for their tastes. The patio itself has some nice comfortable couches and several tables setup as well. We sat next to a fire pit in the cool May evening and talk about our trip being an epic success thus far.  Later in the evening as the crowd died down, we went over Nassau and P's tables and got our dance on a bit. \n\nAfter it was all said and I don't I hardly remember my elevator ride back up to my room. I m glad I stayed at the HRH and went to Vanity. It just makes things so much easier. I will come to Vanity as much as possible when I stay at the HRH. It will be my post club, club on all nights.\n\nPS. Whats up with the chicks getting an entire dressing room for their bathroom? The guys just get a couple of cans and urinals. How unfair!"
0,"They should be sued for defaming New York!! \n\nIf these people are from New York tor Italian, they should go out back and shoot themselves!! If not, then any good New Yorker or Italian should do it for them!\n\nI ordered the Baked Ziti, My Sister in Law ordered Penne, and My Wife Ordered Macaroni and Cheese, First, we all were given Mosticcolli for every order. I would consider this false advertising as it is not what is stated in their menu. The Sauce was the same for the Penne and Ziti Dish, Bland, No flavor, just mushed tomatoes.\n\nAfter looking at the menus, who the hell puts ham in a lasagne?? food doesn't just suck, it swallows!!"
0,"Meh, I've had many many many better poutines than this. This place is in the list of top restaurants on Yelp, but I guarantee that it's because a bunch of tourists have written about it. Locals don't come away from La Banquise going \""that was a great poutine\"" - it just doesn't happen.\n\nThis place has a wide selection of ingredients to make your poutine with, but really there's only three you NEED in a fantastic poutine: fries, cheese curds, and gravy. Everything else is a gimmick. If you really really feel the need to 'choose your own adventure' go to one of the Poutineville restaurants - I've had much better food and service at their restaurants than here.\n\nOn top of it all, there's often a big queue to get in to this place, and in case you didn't read the rest of my review; It's just not worth it."
0,Save your money and frustration!!! I have never been treated so horrible by a manager in customer service in my life. And the food isn't great to begin with. This place will go under...just wait for it...

0,"Thursday is amateur open mic comedy night. Not sure if this is a new promotion or they've been doing it for a while but that was the thing that made my group of buddies want to go.\n\nThe comedy is open mic and preformed by amateur locals. The host is a drag queen who is just hilarious and isnt afraid to offend or pick on some of the average joes attending. \n\nThe rest of the local comedians can range from 'please pass the mic' to 'omg did he just say that?' Definitely not for the faint of heart or for the easily offended. \n\nStarts at 10 ends at 12\n\nThe food was a bit disappointing. We all split an order of 50 wings in Spicy Garlic and Mild flavors. After about 45 minutes the host announced the comedy night special which offered 10 wings for 5 dollars any flavor. Kinda pissed our bartender didnt mention that nor did she mention any of the drink specials. We all could have saved some cash ordering less and been a lot happier with flavors we individually wanted.\n\nThe Spicy Garlic was neither spicy nor was it very garlicy it did have a pleasing flavor but nothing you would lable 'spicy' or 'garlic'\n\nThe mild didnt have sauce of any kind, Bartender explained that it's just deep fried wings tossed in butter. She offered to take it back to the kitchen to throw some medium sauce on it so we let her, when they came back semi tossed in sauce nostrils flared from the hot sauce/vinegar fumes. The bark was obviously worse then the bite. The medium had no bite. The sauce was so mild i didnt think it was any improvement from mild at all. \n\nIn the future if i were to come back and order wings i'd request them to be naked and unbreaded. The breading is pretty thick and i cant remember tasting very much chicken at all.\n\n\nGetting to the point. Hooters is the go to place for sports, beers, wings, and eyecandy in lots of other cities but in Las Vegas there's just so many other places that do the job better."
0,"Why would I come to your place again. The first time is humiliating enough to be ask to leave right after dessert is served. \n\nI think your clarification was incorrect. As soon as dessert was cleared, we we were asked to leave. As I stated in 30 years of dining I never encountered such rudeness.  We  paid closed to $800 dollars for dinner. \n\nThe other people didn't want to sit outside. What make you think we wanted to sit outside? There were Mosquitos outside!\n\nPlease be nice. Don't treat us by the color of our skin! The world need more love and less hatred."
0,Disappointed. I had purchased a groupon and went online to schedule. I arrived to my appointment and the tech walked out of suite about 5 til my appointment time. She returned 10 minutes later. Still not acknowledging me if I was her next client. Needless to say I didn't stick around after that. I will contact groupon for a refund. Will not recommend this place to anyone and will let everyone know how clients are treated
1,Yummy...Seafood.. This place has both seafood from the west coast and east coast..\n\n\nI love their selections.. Their shrimp and lobster salad looked succulent and their Cajun gumbo was to die for..  \n\nThis is the real deal if you want to eat a seafood restaurant.. Hands down one of the best seafood restaurants I have been too in a long time...\n\nWonderful very bright atmosphere makes you feel like your on island in the middle of the desert...hehe
0,"Disgusting...blah.  I am not real picky when it comes to casual restaurants.  But I have to admit, some of this food was barely edible.  The calamari was so chewy, it tasted like rubber.  The turkey burger ordered by one comrade came out pink.  That is a little scary since turkey really should be thoroughly cooked.  My eggplant ravioli was tolerable but made my husband gag.  One person ordered the pastrami sandwich and picked at it...and I have to say, we are not the kind to snub our noses at good sandwiches.  The only thing that was pretty good was the chicken pot pie.  \n\nOn top of the nasty food, our waitress seemed completely stoned.  It took her 10 minutes to get us our drinks and she would disappear for several minutes at a time.  When we asked her questions, she had not clue what the answer was and had to go ask someone else.  Seriously incompetent.  So, my suggestion is to steer clear of this place."
0,"This store is farily new to the premium outlets. The store isn't real clean. There are items sitting on the floor and hanging off of racks.  Shoes aren't in boxes. THey are torn up and had been torn through. Handbags were hung on racks, sitting on shelves, and some were wrapped in full zips along the walls. The sales staff looked at me, up and down at least twice, and didn't say a word. I didn't even get a \""Hi\"" out of them or anything. There are some items thatr I was interested in here but considering they weren't willing to ask if I needed help even, I didn't stick around. I found some real good buys. I found a pair of real cute ballerina shoes for $39 and a purse for $110-120.  Jewelry is pulled out of the boxes and have been scattered all over the case.  I was upset by this and just left. If I'd been assisted, I would have for sure purchased at least 3 items, a shirt for Kaelani, a pair of shoes for me, and this cute pair of boxers that I saw for Walter. Too bad!!"
0,I absolutely love Rubios but this location is having some serious issues. The staff isn't very pleasant or efficient at all. Dining in is a mistake because that place is not clean. It is hard to enjoy the food when everywhere you look needs a clean up. I wish management would notice the issues and make the necessary changes. The prices are not cheap so it would be nice to have some more quality in the experience.
0,"Came in for a Chocolate Malt and got Hershey' s Syrup with vanilla ice cream, very disappointing."
0,"Sadly, Ella's Deli continues its decent towards total failure.\nI decided to try the deli for the 12th time in the past year, and the quality of the place has dropped even lower than before. \n\nThe prices have been hiked yet again, the portions\nhave shrunk again, the waitstaff has been reduced in number AGAIN, and the most upsetting thing that has happened to this once great deli is the fact the place is filthy. \n\nThey really need to close for a good week and clean the place from top to bottom. Want to know how bad this once great Madison attraction has fallen? I saw a roach crawling around on floor. A freaking ROACH. As in the creepy crawly kind - not the Willy Street kind. :)\n\nThis makes me so sad as this place was once a true landmark for Madison. Now it is hanging on a thread - only getting by due to the animatronic toys and gadgets. If this were any other Resturant, it would have closed down years ago.\n\nSad."
1,Big ass burgers. Damn good fast food. It's still a fast food joint so dont expect the most amazing tasting or healthy type food but its still good. Service wasn't amazing but i have no complaints about it. enjoy
1,"This is a stop we make during every Vegas trip. Being a Parrothead, we have to. \n\nMargaritas are excellent, the food is mostly good (Crab Dip - Very good; Jerk Chicken - good; Taco Salad - not). Service is good and the atmosphere is fun."
0,"Told the waitress we had a meeting to go to down the street, and were in quite a hurry. She said it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nIt then took about 20 minutes to get drinks, about 45 min to an hour for the food (which was wrong, but we didnt have time to get a new one), and about an hour and a half before we saw the waitress again to ask for a reciept. We were so insanely late to the meeting we missed the entire thing. \n\nWorst service I've ever had in Charlotte, not to mention the fact we specifically told the waitress we were in a hurry, and she said it wouldn't be any inconvenience.\n\nWent back about a year later, and the service was still ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!!! \n\nWill never, ever, ever, go back here. Even though they do have good milkshakes."
0,"If the stale retirement home setting and stuck-in-the-80's styled menu don't encourage you to leave before ordering, waiting for the amateur service will.\n\nOh, you're still here? Ok, go ahead and order any of their so-called omelettes. Be sure to also ask for lots of napkins because you'll be crying when you finally see the nonsense that comes out of the kitchen.\n\nThe way I see it, cooking omlettes is very simple: you take good ingredients, mix them together, cook it all without burning. Somehow they manage to ignore all of these suggestions. Yes, even the \""mixing\"" part. They apparently manufacture a plain omelette on one side of the kitchen, and then lightly sprinkle on whatever ingredients right before serving it.\n\nWhen paying my bill at the front I was asked, \""How was everything?\"".\nI replied in a polite tone, \""O.K.\""\nCashier boy responds in bewilderment, \""Just 'O.K.'?!?\""\nI finally leave him with, \""I'm being nice when I say 'O.K.'\""\n\nI'm sticking to Taylor's, Matt's and 5th Avenue Cafe for my weekend breakfast."
1,Dr. Satterlee is a doctor who understands what the patient needs and how best to get them to their goals.  I am a physician and I know when someone knows what they are doing and when they do not.  His keen observation of the mechanics of the body allow him to put you on a program that will give you the best chance to do the things you want.  I have only just started with help for my back pain (which is not related directly to my back turns out) so stay tuned but I am confident in his skills and passion for his work and I WILL be referring him patients.  I also love his straightforward talk which most chiropractors fail to do.
0,"Unfortunately this is the only place on Lake Wylie to eat when you are out on your boat other than a snack bar. The deck and the boat docks are the only reason they are still in business. If you want a drink order beer or wine. The drinks are watered down and shots are limited because the premium liquor selections are limited.  The food leaves a lot to be desired.  We ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla, mozzarella cheese sticks and a burger because we thought it would be hard to mess that up. We were wrong.  The chicken had some artifical smoke flavor added and that was the only flavor.  The filling ingredients were not evenly distributed so there were areas overloaded and areas with nothing. The cheese sticks were a lukewarm frozen product, the marina was much hotter and appears to be a frozen product nuked in little cups because the plastic was melting.  The hamburger was not seasoned and mediocre.  The fries were mushy and limp.   On top of all this the place appears grungy and dated.  The place is falling apart and obviously being run into the ground in an attempt to just milk every possible dime out of it. This is the last chance we are giving this place.  Hopefully everyone will also give up on it so a decent place can be moved in, but I think the building is beyond saving at this point."
0,"The check in line was crazy long. They had everyone working up at the desk, but the wait was ridiculous. If they would not waste time trying to sell upgrades to every guest checking in, the process would be much faster.  Not the newest rooms, but you are also not paying Venetian prices."
0,"My fiance and I felt like Mexican sounded good tonight so we tried this place out.  The service was slow, and the food was rather bland and dry.  The portions are big, and we ended up taking home leftovers that probably won't get eaten.  I'd recommend fast food like Roberto's over this place."
0,I don't know if they read their reviews or not but they should. This was shockingly bad. The teriyaki chicken literally had no sauce.. never seen anything like it.  The house chicken is aptly named because it tasted like drywall.  Zero flavor.  I have no idea how this place is in business.
1,"For the moment, I have a gun in my home that a friend has lent me so that I could decide if this is something I really want around. So far, only good things to say. I've been to a defensive pistol association \""shoot\"" so that I could get better not just at hitting a stationary piece of paper but also be comfortable handling this weapon in a more 'active' situation.\n\nI had already stopped by Hyatt and checked out their accessories, finding them to be much more expensive than anything available on the Internet. While they were very helpful, I thought it might be best to shop around. Which brought me to Carolina Sporting Arms.\n\nSimilarly stocked with accessories in a neatly organized manner, a sales guy was immediately able to help point me to what I was looking for. And I found that here too, it's very expensive compared to Internet pricing. So that's two.\n\nIf you're looking for something that cant be shipped FedEx (like a gun or live ammunition) or if there is something you need right away, then here is a good stop. But if you can wait for it, there are any number of sporting goods vendors on the Internet that will save you a bunch of money."
0,Welcome to the Wal Mart of casinos. This casino aint done nothing for nobody nowhere.
0,Salty miso soup.  Disappointing sushi.  Likely due to the possibility that it looks like not a single Japanese person works here.  The waitress had no idea what Futomaki is...sigh.  Montreal.... Not one good Japanese restaurant?
1,"Considering that finding delivery in South Phoenix is nearly impossible, this place is a gem. We stopped in to get take out because they do not have an online menu, and we were rather pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of the food, not to mention the great prices... Under $4 for lunch??? Seriously!.  The staff was friendly and the food was quickly prepared and hot when we drove it home.  We would order from here again in a heartbeat."
0,"Horrible!\n\nI liked the concept for Stax, little customizable sliders with good bits of meat. It was sound in theory. But I'm afraid I'm going to have to shop around elsewhere for my mini customizable-burger joint because this place, quite frankly, sucked.\n\nThe waiters led the five of us to a small four-seater table, counted us, shrugged, and then walked off. Ok ...\n\nSides. The sweet potato fries, while cooked well, were tasteless. The onion rings tasted ok, but were a bit undercooked and so slid out of their breaded crusts. The tater tots, however, were pretty awesome and got caught up in the middle of a ravenous feeding frenzy until the basket was emptied.\n\nBurgers. Bleck. My wagyu beef burger was charred enough for it \""burnt black\"" to be the predominant flavor, and my duck burger was dry AND tasteless. The only escapee from the dry patty afflication was a sloppy joe (to be fair, I'm not sure HOW you make a dry sloppy joe).\n\nDrinks. What drinks? No top ups on water, nothing. After about 15 minutes of empty glasses, the waitress finally and unceremoniously plunked down a carafe on one end of the table and walked off.\n\nCheck. After telling us a split check was fine, the waitress plunked down one bill, and told us to itemize it ourselves. We handed back a clearly labeled reciept, and watched her puzzle over our fairly simple notation (We had numbered each item, it was MENSA grade complex. Really.). Ten minutes later (we had watched them puzzle for a while), one of the other workers came up to us and told me to just add it up for them. Now muttering dire threats under my breath, I added up everything on the back of the receipt (the waitress offered to lend me her calculator afterwards). Then, they offered to print us up the separate orders by seat. (Huh?)\n\nTheir tip? \""Tip has been adjusted to reflect accounting services provided.\"" $0.00"

1,"Thanks Yelp! I now have periodic cravings for this food!\n\nSeriously, I do. It's fast food, but more authentic Mexican. NOT Taco Bell. And really tasty!\n\nAnd I really don't like breakfast burritos. Never. But someone bought one for me, and I was really surprised. It was delicious!\n\nCravings...!"
1,"I went up to DC Ranch on a first date, new to the area so it was new to me. She suggested we initially meet here, but then changed her mind and this was our second stop. I was impressed with the space. It was a Friday night and I was surprised that it wasn't more crowded. We started there around 9. The bar is very trendy looking. We asked if we could be seated outside mainly because the music was just too loud. Granted I don't mind loud music, but considering hardly any one was in there and the  mood felt like it should have been more intimate, it was overstated. We did get to sit in a booth outside which was very nice. The booths were semicircle with high leather backs. On the table was this large candle holder. It looked like a glass brick which was about two feet high and six inches thick. And yes the glass was thick so the light was very dim. Normally I wouldn't complain about that, but when I asked to see the bar menu, it was close to impossible. I asked the waiter for more light so he brought over three of these things. Still not enough light. I finally asked another waiter who was walking by if he had a flashlight just so we could read the menu. And oddly he did have one of those pocket ones. FINALLY! I thought that was nice of him to do that. The night was very relaxing and from where we sat, there was a great painting with vibrant colors on the wall. It looked nice enough to want it in my house. I never asked the waiter for it though. We stayed there about an hour and a half and just talked."
1,"I eat here many times. I am that single guy people look at and feel sorry for cause I am reading something and ignoring them, unless she is hot ;)\nYou cannot go wrong with any of the food here. Really.\nNow that its winter, its PHO and more PHO.\nAs custom men will serve you and the women will take your money, haha.\nCheck it out."
0,"Located near the 215 and Sunset, it's usually a pretty busy location.  The store is very clean, open and bright.   \n\nI had ordered an item online but needed to return it.   There were a few people in line with only one person working their customer service desk.   I understand that returns take a bit longer than checking out.  She finally called for some backup to help her out.  The lady who helped me seemed bothered and irritated.  I had a simple return so why frustrated with me?  I guess that's why I try to avoid going into the store.  \n\nI have had better experiences at other locations even when returning an item.  I hope I don't have to do this again any time soon."
0,"Food was ok. They obviously had their B team wait staff on tonight. Rude, ignored us for stretches at a time, and we seemed more of an inconvenience then a paying customer.  Will be a long time before I am willing to try this place again."
1,"Great hangover food or breakfast for anyone craving classics or pancakes with a twist. I had a skillet breakfast and it was perfectly greasy, my friends had that day's special and the breakfast burrito. Once our food arrived we couldn't talk because we couldn't stop eating. Friend staff too!"
1,"I'm glad we decided to do our Black Friday shopping while we stayed in Las Vegas.\n\nThe staffs were all very helpful and patient while I requested one after another bag be brought down for my scrutiny.\n\nStore isn't too big so it can get crowded, especially when there is a sale event going on. But the place is kept neat and tidy as the employees were constantly moving around putting things back."
0,"My sister said that Mr. Lucky's $7.77 \""Gambler's Special\"" was a MUST have while we were in Vegas and since we were staying at HRH it was convenient . We got to the hotel too early for check-in, so we decided to grab a bit to eat. I must say... there was nothing impressive about this meal - at all. It comes with a steak, 3 shrimp, mashed potatoes and broccoli. The steak was overcooked and very chewy, the shrimp was overcooked and the mashed potatoes and broccoli were extremely salty. It was horrible. It was my first meal in Vegas and I'm getting this?? Really! Yuck. \n\nWe went back on our last day to try breakfast since the rest of the menu didn't look too bad. I can't remember clearly what we ordered, but again it was very unimpressive. I do remember it was around $15 a plate for something I could make 5x better at home. I wouldn't recommend going here."
1,I'm embarrassed that I have only ate here two times and I live in very close proximity of this restaurant. Ate here tonight and it was perfection.  The server was so genuine & amazing! Lettuce wraps were delish along with the inside out quinoa burger. I was so impressed with start to finish. This is on my new rotating list of places to eat.
1,"4 out of 5 - food is solid, great location and our server Marwa made the experience.   Mouskaa, Fattoush and baba ganoush were fantastic but the mixed grilled meats were the star of show, tender and perfectly grilled.   Overall a great place to dine."
1,Great Ambiance \nOur Waiter was super nice!\nMust Try the Mongolian Beef (AMAZING!)\na bit over priced but worth the experience.
1,"Saw this place on MvF and finally got to visit.  The portion as are huge and so my wife and I shared an entree (I would recommend you do this). We had the fried chicken eggs Benedict.  It comes with a biscuit (instead of the English muffin), it is a mountain of food.  The chipotle cream sauce is a bit strong and so I might get that on the side if I ordered it again, but the chicken was fantastic.\n\nWe are going back again on this trip to share the corned beef hash, but next time I would like to try the chicken and waffles as that looked amazing.\n\nThe service was excellent."
1,"I have eaten at Lebanese restaurants around the world and can assure you that Kaza Maza ranks very close to the top, if not the top of this list. The menu is inventive and masterfully done. Try the three cold meze and choose the dishes made from beet and roasted red pepper (muhammara). I have not seen their like before. The lamb chops and kafte in pomegranate were incredible and full of flavor and texture. Trust the staff when they make suggestions, they know what they are talking about. This was one of the best meals I have had."
1,"We did not have to pay for tickets and the guy that bought them got a Black Friday deal so we had some decent seats. How can you complain about a free show?\n\n   The visuals and aerials were incredible. They left me thinking about the performance a week later. The music is from the slower songs by the Beatles. Even though I was familiar with them, my girlfriend was not.  \n\n   There is so much happening at once that it was easy to become overwhelmed to the point I lost track of the story they were trying to tell; however the stage was specifically built for this act so I concentrated on that and was amazed by just the technical aspects.  There is a behind the scenes tour that I would love to check out."
1,Last night was my first time in The Little Theater which is part of Phoenix Theater.  I didn't see it on the list so I'm reviewing it here. \n\nWe saw Reefer Madness the musical!  It was awesome!  I couldn't stop laughing.  The sound of the theater was excellent! \n\nIt was definitely small and the seats very uncomfortable.\n\nThey had snacks out during intermission.  We bought two water bottles and I was happy to see them put a box out for recycling the water bottles and the soda cans.  They also had a box out for recycling the programs once the play finished. \n\nI will definitely see another play here!
0,"Today I notice a Toyota Prius (White) with California License Plates (plate number 6RRM802) illegally parked in the Handicap Parking Space in front of this store -- it was the third time this week that the same car has been parked there.  I went inside to inquire if they knew who owned the vehilce, and a very nice young man responded that it was the \""owner\"" so he really could not say anything about the illegal parking.\n\nThen a lady came from the back of the store and asked if I was the guy that was complaining about her parking.  I indicated that I was, and she said she was not really parked there (yet the vehicle was not running, and nobody was in the car -- I guess she has a different definition of parking).  I asked her if she realized that she was in a Handicap Parking Space and she acknowledged that she did know that, and did not really care.  She then asked me if I felt better about myself and I indicated that I was fine, and asked if she felt good about herself parking in a Handicap parking Space -- she said she was fine with.\n\nPeople, we need to collectively do something about this.  The owner of business intentionally parking in a disabled spot, and making no apologies for doing so, and to top it off she owns a business in Arizona and does not have Arizona Plates on her vehicle  ... I say we should all boycott this location of Edible Arrangements ...\n\nI am only giving one star, because YELP requires you to give at least one star."
1,"At the suggestion of many Yelpers, we hit the Le Village Buffet at about 11am on a Saturday. The line was pretty long when we came in, I guess as a result of people trying to take advantage of the breakfast/lunch switchout. We hadn't planned on doing that but it ended up happening anyway! \n\nYour enjoyment of any buffet is contingent upon managing your expectations. For Le Village Buffet, this can be summed up as such: Do not expect French cuisine! \n\nDone.\n\nThat being said, the stuffed crepes were by far the star, but I also loved the mini quiches and of course the standard breakfast fare of potatoes, bacon, sausage, etc. The desserts were also plentiful and delicious."
1,This is my favorite restaurant in Tempe. The food is great with many vegetarian options. The atmosphere is usually pretty quiet and the servers are all nice. Highly recommended
0,"This is tough to give 2 stars to. I honestly think that if it wasn't so outrageously expensive, It would have 3. Yes I know, it's in Vegas and Vegas is expensive. But the Denny's style menu (breakfast lunch and dinner all day) just shouldn't be that much. \nAfter much debate between the make-your-own omelette or the french dip... I went with the french dip.\nIt was big. Maybe too big. I'd almost describe it as I had some bread with my meat. The sandwich itself wasn't bad. It was soaking wet with grease which was disappointing, but the quality was pretty good. The sauce (they do it with gravy instead of au jus) was waaaay too salty. Had they toned it down on the salt, it would have been a lot better. The saving grace were the fries. They were really quite good. \nIt's the noise level got a little obnoxious. I know its Vegas, but between the casino and the amount of employees yelling across the restaurant, it was a little much.\nWith the big menu and the convenience of being located in MGM, it may be worth a shot. However, get out your wallets... my french dip was $20. Ouch."
0,"My friends and I were in the mood for some cheap sushi..and since I was with 5 guy friends, I was not surprised they chose an all-you-can-eat place.  As per my profile, I LOVE AYCE sushi.  However, Makino doesn't quite satisfy this AYCE sushi lover.  The sushi rolls weren't good. They tasted a bit odd.  The rice seemed too tough and the quality of the fish wasn't at a top standard.  The restaurant is a good size for those dining in groups, but I really would not miss this restaurant.  And even though there are other AYCE sushi places that are a bit more pricey, I'd rather pay a bit more to satisfy my tastebuds as well as have no risk to my own health."
1,"The best Thai food I had in long time.  I started with Sa-Tay of chicken.  Very good pickle vegetables and a delicious peanut sauce.  I enjoy it immensely.  My girlfriend had the Tom Yum Kai.  She really enjoyed the soup.  I was lucky and got to try it before she ate it up.  I agree, the soup was great.\nI had the drunken seafood noodles with spice level of 7.  It was spicy but satisfying.  The food was delicious and the spicy sauce was incredible.  We came pretty late but service was still very good.  Definitely, will be back again."
1,"This place is TASTY! Love the pho and spring rolls... awesome food and prices.......but one thing i had a problem with was when I order the appetizers. Make it clear how many orders you want. The last time I ordered 1 order of the 2 spring rolls, so my boyfriend and I could have one each, but the server brought out 4 and charged me twice. This also happened with a larger group... 2 orders came out to 4 orders.. i think the server counted the people and assumed we want 2 each.. anyhoo...its yummy and cheap, not a big deal. Peanut sauce is great on everything, I mean everything..."
0,"The flavors are not true to the names. The Watermelon flavor tasted like liquid Amoxicillin. Also the customer service was not up to par. They were extremely inattentive, I was left at the counter for about 15 minutes without so much as a look and the woman behind me was overcharged. There was a very nice girl working who apologized for the inconvenience and an extremely rude girl who managed to ruin the entire experience for me and my family."
0,"Pizza tasted ok, but pizza was cold.  We ordered, we waited, and the pizza came out cold!  How?"
0,"I enjoy most Zipps locations but this one has the worst management of all of all Zipps. Truly rude and definitely incompetent. Food is greasy and cheap but a decent place to watch the game over a drink with friends, however there are too many other options around here to waste your time and money at this place."
1,This is a good alternative to Subway. They have a more original menu and less of a corporate feel. There's also a punch card for frequent visitors.
0,"The only good thing about this location is the cute cheap clothing.\n\nThe customer service here is one of the worst that I've had ever. The employees are not friendly at all. I wanted to buy shoes and there were several employees standing by the cashier just talking to each other. I waited for a bit, thinking that they would approach me, but when they didn't I took it upon myself to do so. I didn't think much of it at first, but after approaching them, and of course saying, \""Excuse me,\"" first, I was met with some very unfriendly looks as they got my shoe size from the back. The rude service continued with the cashier, who didn't even smile once during check out.\n\nOverall, there are several other locations in the valley where the customer service is way better. I only come back to this one because it's closest to my house."
1,I'll never get sick of this place. The drunken noodles are great and the back patio is an awesome place to eat.
1,"Somebody pinch me, an auto repair place that is a joy to deal with?  Thanks to Jon, Stephanie & Jeremy, I can only drive Hondas, Toyotas or Acura because that is all they work on and I won't go anywhere else."
1,"I called Scott at EZ Flow Plumbing after reading the excellent reviews in yelp and was very glad I did. Just moving into a new house with terrible water. So bad I wouldn't even let my dogs drink it. Scott went over all my options and I selected my system of choice for clean, fresh tasting water. Mark arrived on time, installed the system and within hours I had all the pure drinking water I needed--from every tap in the house.\n\nThe install took a bit longer than expected and I had to leave for another appointment, but felt totally comfortable with Mark finishing up the install in my absence. When I returned home the system was completed and everything working as expected. EZ Flow Pluming even has a very cool payment processing system and notification system so that you know when to expect their plumber.\n\nMark was very professional, friendly and efficient. Thanks to Mark, Scott and the EZ Flow Plumbing team, I now have clear, drinkable water!!"
1,"Once a month my girlfriends and I get together for a long overdue \""Girls' Night\""!! This month we had the pleasure of trying out Baku, which is centrally located on Sharon Rd. across from South Park Mall. \n\nUn-freaking-believable!!! There was something for everyone, I'm not kidding!! We decided to start with a few sushi and sashimi dishes to share while we discussed wine and sake options with our server, whom I might add was charming, accommodating, friendly, and overall extremely helpful and patient with all of our questions. He picked out a few bottles of sake for our table to share based on listening to our likes and dislikes, delicious! \n\nNext, we decided to continue our experience with some skewers (the pork belly are to die for) and some small bites (2 words: roasted oysters). As new food came, so did new plates, the staff definitely made us feel as if they too, wanted us to have an amazing experience. We tried everything! We ended our meal with surf and turf and vegetable courses, including the spicy filet, lamb chops, duck, Madagascar prawn (you have to see this thing!), black cod, salmon, grilled baby artichokes, and portobello mushrooms. \n\nWe were so stuffed after trying so many delicious items, we almost passed on dessert.... J/k!! We decided to share the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, mango toffee cake, and assorted sorbets. Holy cow!!!! \n\nFrom the decor and ambiance, to the attentiveness and outstanding service, I know I'll be back and I know we will also be back for more \""Girls' Nights\"" in the near future. This may just be my new favorite restaurant!!"
1,"I bought so many frags from this place! Loved it got my water premade from them, so bumped out this placed closed"
0,This place is Awful! In town this week for a basketball tourney. Somebody broke into the room from the a joining room & when they came back it smelled like somebody smoked a pack of cigarets! Thursday night while the boys slept somebody came into the room while they slept & stole my sons money! Coach called front desk & security & nothing was done. Same thing happened last year! Never stay here! Pay a little more money & stay somewhere else! They deserve no stars!
1,"After 2 weeks of research on tires, they offered me the lowest price I could find. They were fast ( I was in and out in about 20 min) and they were courteous."
0,CAREFUL!! DONT BUY ANYTHING.  They don't refund even their products give allergies. Their staff will push you around and lie. Wasting ur time
0,Poor service. Food quality is just ok. Ran out of food items and it is only Saturday morning!
0,"Good food, Shitty service."
0,"Decided on a last minute long weekend trip to LV and found hotel rates surprisingly high. Circus Circus was the cheapest by at least $50, but it wasn't worth it. It was just hellishly loud, full of frumpy folks and their screaming kids, dirty, run-down, and ridiculously far from anything considering it is \""on the strip\"" - the buildings are set back about 1/4 mile from Las Vegas Blvd., and with the demise of Stardust and Westward Ho, only the somewhat rundown Riviera is within a few steps. The not-that-thrilling destinations of The Stratosphere and The Sahara are within what might be a 10-minute walk at a normal gait, but turns into a 20-minute journey, slogging along behind the cattle-like herds wandering between the creepy hotels and construction sites that fill this decidedly un-glamorous little portion of LV. Words cannot express how disappointed I was to spend the time and money to go to Las Vegas, only to feel stranded in this hellish little ghetto. Any savings on the room were spent on cab fare getting the hell out of there. I love Fremont Street for retro Vegas, and I appreciate the glam of the new high-end mega-casinos - The Stratosphere, Sahara, and Riviera are in-and-of-themselves, not bad, but their location will mean their eventual demise. Circus Circus, on the other hand, puts the downward drag on this already lacking section of Vegas, and is not worth visiting at any price. It should be dynamited as soon as possible."
0,"I lost 4 pounds of muscle and the \""doctor\"" took me off the program in 4 days.  This company does not know what they are doing with HCG.  I told them up front that I was going to the gym doing intense workouts, and they still put me on the program.  They offered me a partial refund, but I believe they should have been refunded in full."
0,"I want to really like this place since it's so close to my work and we end up eating here all of the time, but it's almost as if they try to find new ways to upset me with inconsistencies and wrong orders.  Among the disappointments (besides the long wait times):\n\n*Ordered a Thai Salad to go, got back to my office and opened it, it was a Thai noodle bowl.  \n*Have had smoothie cups filled without about an inch or so of cup space to spare on top.  Are they not measuring ingredients or just rushing through orders? \n*Numerous salads served without dressing.  But they may have rectified that because now the salads are served pre-tossed with dressing. At least they were for one day.\n*Wraps that are served scalding hot.  Maybe check the oven temperature gauge.  I've been burned so often with the Jamaican Jerk, that I'm afraid to order them anymore.\n\nWhat made me finally write was today, while watching my smoothie get made, it may have been too thick, so the worker ran some tap water into the container a couple of times.  Good if you're mixing cement I suppose, but it made the smoothie runny and watery as I'm sure the tap wasn't the same temp as the rest of what had already been blended.  As a result, I got a watery blob that tasted like a weak slurpee.\n\nThe original owner ran a tight ship and kept the place spotless and consistent from order to order. Since he left a couple of years ago, this place has gone downhill in terms of quality, cleanliness, and service.  During some of my long waits, I've seen people stand in front of the counter for minutes on end before even being greeted.  You'd think even the blender operators who face the front of the store could at least throw them a \""someone will be with you in a minute\"", but no they just act like they didn't see them walk in.\n\nAlas, I'll be back just for the convenient location."
0,Way overrated! Other than the raw oysters and stone crab everything is pretty salty and normal. \nSave the $63 and go to wicked!
1,One of the best shows in Vegas.  These 5 men can sing like no band you have ever heard. A small room where everyone is part of the party.what a great time.
1,"This review is long overdue. When it's 100+ degrees in Vegas, all I can ever think about is, \""I really need an ice cold milk tea or some ICE CREAM right about now!\"" This place is perfect because they offer both. =D\nI ordered a macaron ice cream sandwich and a milk tea because I couldn't decide. Both were freakin' delicious compared to any other asian cafe place I had in Vegas. The ice cream was smooth and not too icy, also the green tea flavor really stood out. The boba was perfectly chewy and sweet. Recommend this place to anyone who needs something cool on a hot Vegas day!"
0,"Today I ordered a large vanilla cone and paid for it the person at the counter  said \""That'll be right up for you.\"" Well it wasn't right up and I waited for 20 minutes before they finally got around to making it for me. Another time a couple years ago i ordered an ice cream cone and the boy who was working behind the counter made the cone and set it on top the ice cream machine and let it melt. when I asked why my cone was sitting there melting he said very rudely, \"" oh i forgot i made it. here you go.\"" he said and handed me the cone. \""I don't want the melted cone!\"" I said. I was furious and even more so when I had to argue with him that he owed me a new, fresh cone. What an embarassment! C'mon McDonalds, get your stuff together!!"
1,"This place was absolutely amazing. I was there alone on a sunday afternoon and I was treated like royalty. I orderd the Green Chile pulled pork sandwich and it was the best sandwich I have ever had. \n-The egg bun was the best part. \nMy server Lexi was knowledgeable and fun, she even reccomended a great cocktail that was thouroughly enjoyed."
0,"Being from Southern California where the king of crawfish restaurant resides, The Boiling Crab, it's hard to find another place that can dethrone it. But my wife and I had to give Hot and Juicy Crawfish a try after seeing it on one of our favorite shows, Man vs Food.\n\nThe food looked absolutely delicious on the show, everything that my wife and I come to expect from this type of restaurant.  We had a basketball tournament in Vegas this past weekend and made sure we made time to head over to Hot and Juicy.\n\nMade it there on Friday afternoon around 1:30pm. I was happy to see that it wasn't so busy and were able to get seated right away. At Boiling Crab, the average wait time is an hour.\n\nWe ordered the following: one pound of crawfish, two pounds of shrimp and five corns all in the special Hot and Juicy sauce medium spicy.\n\nThe sauce itself was not bad. It's doable but it does not compare to Boiling Crab's shabang sauce.  The shabang sauce is love at first bite. \n\nThe crawfish was not bad but the shrimp and corn were not very good. The body of the shrimp was fine but the shrimp heads was dry. No juice/brains to enjoy sucking on and the corn was very rubbery, sort of like eating candy corn.  My wife and I shared one corn and left 4 uneaten. Normally, we could eat three each.\n\nFor those who have not tried Boiling Crab, you might find Hot and Juicy Crawfish a good place to eat.  But for those who have dined at Boiling Crab, you will be disappointed.  \n\nI will be sending Adam Richman (host of Man vs Food) an email of my review and a recommendation that if he is ever in Orange County California, to stop by Boiling Crab and see what he thinks."
1,"This place was awesome!  We went here on our first day in Vegas, and it did not disapoint.  We had four people, so we were able to get a ton of different dishes, and none of them were bad, though some were just ok.  Most, however, are great.  Make sure you ask your waiter what is good...ours did not lead us wrong.  Best dishes were the filet mignon sliders, merguez, and the stuffed dates."
1,"My family does not eat out very often, so when we do we want to make it a memorable experience.  Going to the Block & Grinder was a great call.\n\nThe menu is not overwhelming, but it has some basic choices as well as several that are unique and fun.  I actually went with the duck.  I've eaten a lot of duck in my life; however, this was the best I've ever had.  \n\nWe had a very good meal.  The staff was good, and we look forward to coming back."
1,"Been here about five times now since it opened; and it's still an awesome club to visit.\n\nThe cabana tables we had a while ago were beautiful; you're provided with your own private area with a hot tub in the front, a few tables inside, a bartender, host, and your own bottles. That was a really fun experience, and definitely worth the price if you can garner up a good group that's willing to pay for it!\n\nThe entire place is huge and once in; the first thing that strikes you is the scenic pool setting. It's a great place to come during the summer nights (same rules as XS, don't jump in the pool!) and the drinks are quite awesome.\n\nDefinitely not as packed and marketed as XS, Marquee, or the like; which for my group of buddies, is good! No lines, no hassle, and still an awesome atmosphere. \n\nCover varies, once we paid $50, another $20 depending on what's going on."
1,"This is easily my favorite dim sum place in Vegas. It's a tradition to stop by here on Sunday morning just after checking out of the hotel. It's usually packed (surprise, surprise), but a party of two gets seated really quickly.\n\nWe usually order the typical: har gow, xia chang fun (rice noodle with shrimp), turnip cake, cha siu pao (bbq pork buns), mango pudding (Martin M's fav), bor lor bao (my fav), and sweet tofu (classic dim sum dessert!). The har gow isn't particularly special here, but the xia chang fun is good and not too doughy. The cha siu pao here is one of my favorites of all cha siu pao's - the filling is flavorful and the bun is always fluffy.\n\nThe service is great and the prices are even better - usually comes out to about $10/person, including tax/tip. Love it!"
1,This place was fantastic!! If it weren't for the small portions i'd give this place 5 stars.
0,"I would love for this location to be more consistent but my order is only correct half of the time. The drive thru line is quick, typically. Even with 6+ cars. I enjoy iced coffee but the brew they use here seems to be either too weak or so strong it's nearly in-drinkable. Maybe it's the volume they do, this place is always packed."
1,"Blueberry Hill is THE spot...it's perfect for Sunday morning brunch (read- hungover breakfast ;p) and they have amazing food EVERYTIME!! I usually order the huevos rancheros and the fresh fruit crepes, but the eggs benedict are good and their chicken and waffles rival those of Roscoe's. All in all, Blueberry Hill is a hidden gem in the desert of Las Vegas."
0,"Although nothing major went wrong with my massage, it was certainly not at all relaxing or what I had expected.\nI write this review in attempt to help those who are considering Tranquil Massage for the first time, as well as the business owner or manager. I understand not everyone can afford to get a massage at a high-end spa, but I think whomever considers a massage here needs to have clear expectations.\nI booked my appointment online, requested a female therapist, and even selected my appointment time based on a \""Renee\"" who would be my therapist. Upon arrival to the building, my first thought was, 'maybe I should just go home.' Not exactly what you want to feel when you are about to be half naked with a stranger. I had been given the massage as a gift from a relative, so I thought I may as well walk-in to see what this place was all about - you know, 'never judge a book by its cover.' Upon walking in the building, I nearly bumped into a male (at the time didn't realize that he was a therapist), who just asked, \""Are you here for a massage?\"" I replied yes, and he turned around (was he getting ready to leave?) and lead me into a cold waiting area - no frills, clean, but uncomfortable, smelled kinda funky. He never told me his name, or asked for my name, confirming that I had an appointment. He asked me to fill out a medical form. While I filled it out, I heard another male voice arguing with someone on the telephone.  At this point, I was thinking, 'where is Renee?', and thought maybe he was just getting me all set while she finished up another client or something. I had to use the restroom before we started, and while in there, I thought, 'maybe I should just walk out.' But, again tried to talk myself through it, thinking that I shouldn't be so judgemental, and that I'm sure everything was fine. So I went back. He walked me into a less-than-impressive massage room - again, cold, terrible lighting, and scantily furnished. He started to review my form with me, as I thought, 'is he the one doing my massage? should i tell him I requested a female?' For some reason, I didn't say anything. I guess still hopeful that it wasn't him that would be giving me a massage. UNTIL, he said he would wait outside while I undressed to my comfort level. (1st rule of spa business, if a client requests a female, don't ignore the request. If only a male is available, call the client to confirm it is OK.)  I thought, 'well I guess this is it...'  He came back and began my massage. He was nice enough, and seemed to ask the right questions, however the massage was mediocre at best. The whole time I kept thinking about how uncomfortable I was, the lights were left on bright - which I guess was good so that I didnt feel that I was in a dark room with a strange man, but also a terrible practice for a spa, the music was too loud, I could hear cars driving by outside the window, a cricket was chirping throughout, and even the way the therapist rubbed lotion in his hands bothered me. My mind was buzzing so much with all the things that seemed wrong, or made me uncomfortable, in the end, I just couldn't wait to go home. I wished that I had just left the multiple times I thought about it when I first arrived.\nBased on the other Yelp reviews on the therapists that ARE actually listed on the company website, they sound legit. However, for whomever owns this business, and any potential future clients, you need to be aware of how terrible my expereince was. There are many lessons that should be taken from my review, and I hope, for the sake of the business and others who may encounter what I did, that the persons in charge of this company's image spend less time worrying about getting \""likes\"" on Facebook and producing marketing materials, until they have the basics down."
1,"Was fast, clean, fresh, so\nMuch fun!! I had the Kobe.... Cheeeeeez!! Haven't had such a great piece of Kobe in years. Careful! They warn you they might run out of it. Call in advance and check for availability. At 44 bucks per person, you will not regret for a second, really nice piece of meat-heaven playing a symphony in your mouth!!!"
1,I didn't stay here or gamble here but stopped in for a drink as we wandered down the strip and came across the 'little' man dressed in green pouring god knows what down the throats of willing participants at the bar. While I wouldn't stay here if you payed me cash it's a hilarious stop off as you make your way down the strip and certainly had a ton more atmosphere than many of its neighbors.
1,"Absolutely delicious!! Their sushi is always on point, the Korean street tacos are to die for, and the broccoli and beef melts in your mouth it's so good!!! This is a wonderful atmosphere to go to on a date night! (I've only been to the M casino location)"
1,"OMG.... I love this place. My mom and I come here regularly. The feature pancakes are always a crowd pleaser! The staff and management are also so nice and pleasant. The food is great and the service is fast! Perfect location, food and staff."
0,"the cashier yan lee was a great young man, but i am utterly disgusted with this establish. i purchased a dozen and a half donuts, to take to work for some customers. to myself embarrassment, a customer found a live mealworm in her donut. after tossing the few remaining donuts, i was trying to comfort the customer & had a coworker call the store to speak to the manager/owner (not sure) rose. rose called back requesting all the donuts & showed no empathy. yes, i received a refund. working in customer service, i feel more could have been done. there was no attempt to even try to keep me as a customer. i won't be returning to that bakery, not even for a drink."
1,"Um... Yum! This place was surprisingly good. I have had ramen (real ramen) one other time in Seattle, and I thought it was alright, but this was really good! I got the shio broth, which was good, kind of a standard clear broth, and I added garlic and got chicken in it. The guy at the counter was super helpful, and he helped me pick out what to put in the soup... he didn't even seem (that) annoyed by all of my questions either, so that was nice. I really liked the way they garnished the soup, it had spinach, carrot, sprouts, and green onions. It looked really colorful and added some dimension to the soup. I added some of their spicy seasoning stuff and it was good. The noodles were really tasty, they were just the right texture for ramen, a little chewy. Gotta like that! Also, the chicken surprised me in how good it was! It looked not so great in the bowl, but when I tried it, it was so tender... like infused with the broth and melting in my mouth.... so good. The portion size is huge, I couldn't finish it. I will definitely come back here... if it was good in the summer, I can only imagine it will be great in the winter!"
0,"2 words to describe this joint:\nSNOB CENTRAL!\n\nWent here on the opening weekend just to pop in and see what Aria was going to be bringing to Sin City.  Overall not impressed.  Wanted to have one drink in their \""Deuce\"" Lounge which we ended up calling the DOUCHE LOUNGE.  \n\nThe clientele...wow.  \n\nThe staff...get off your high horse - you work here I'm sure you don't own any shares in the company!  They were being very rude to everyone.  Even the guy that follows the servers around to point a flashlight so the dumb bimbos can see....snob....wow.\n\n I was with a couple that have LOTS of money but don't act the part and they basically tried to make us order bottle service after taking a brief seat to take a look at the overpriced drink menu.  Drinks came and there was lots of pressure to move ASAP and the drinks were not at all well made.  I have been to many high end hotels in Vegas but this one is high end with tons of 'tude.\n\nIf I could give it ZERO stars I would.\n\nGo to the Wynn, Mandalay Bay, Venetian - much more beautiful hotels and they know how to treat their customers.\n\nHappy Holidays! :)"
1,"I love Middle Eastern food and I live on the west side, so I'm disappointed I avoided this place for so long. I even passed by it several days a week for a while. The lousy outward appearance did keep me from dropping by on a whim, but luckily once I found the reviews on Yelp I knew I had to go. (Side note: they have a 'People on Yelp love us' sticker on their window and a posted letter from Yelp congratulating them on the 5 star reviews, so if you get close enough you'll figure out they do rock). \n\nSadly, the location on University Ave annoys the crap out of me! I just want there to be a direct route through all of that residential area between University and Mineral but the only way is to get down to Whitney. Pretty weak, I know, since it only adds 5 minutes on a bad day.\n\nAnyway, let's get to the food! \n\nFirst went to lunch and got the Shish Kafta (ground lamb skewer) with hummus (stir in the spices they sprinkle on top) and tabbouleh. Delicious, delicious tabbouleh.  Always remember with Indian and Middle Eastern: apart it's good, together it's fantastic so MIX! (eat them together, don't stir it up with your spoon, nub). Most meals come with some pita for the table which is actually a bit bland until you add some of the tasty seasoning mix you'll find on the table. Also got some Arabic coffee. The cardamom was a welcome taste to the coffee, just know that Arabic coffee has the grounds in the bottom of the pot, so when you get to the end of your cup, don't take a big swig. It's so rich anyway, you probably wouldn't do that. I don't really call myself a coffee drinker, but I enjoyed it. Too stuffed to try the baklava.\n\nThen I went back to dinner with my sister, her bf, and his sister. YOWZA! Dinner dishes are always more expensive, but the broad selection of entrees and appetizers is fantastic. There are even a number of seafood options which we did not partake in. From the top:  Arabic coffee: Not for everyone (I still like it!). Jibne is absolutely delicious fried cheese and it will squeak like a good cheese curd. Not that you'll want to go back to cheese curds after this, frankly. The Shish Sampler for two...can definitely feed three. And you won't need any rice in any other dishes if you're sharing.The mouhamara is too strong of a pepper flavor for me to eat in large amounts (pureed red pepper) but was appreciated greatly by others at the table. The Mediterranean noodles plate was surprising (Middle Eastern doesn't make me think noodles) but very tasty (and vegetarian) as a complement to the rest of the dishes (we were sharing) but would be too much of the same flavor/texture if I were ordering for just myself. Still too stuffed to try the baklava.\n\nBottom line: I don't think you can go wrong here. Pick something off the menu that looks good and you'll have a great meal. And if it isn't everything you were hoping for right away, it probably will be once you apply hummus and yogurt sauce. \n\nIf you don't k now where to get started:\nTry the Arabic coffee if you like rich coffee, get the Jibne appetizer if you like cheese (if doing dinner), then go for the Shish Kafta with hummus and with each bite combine 2 or more of the components on the plate (lamb kafta or veggies, yogurt sauce, tabbouleh, hummus)."
0,"Went to get the D-back special, three of them to go for my family.  Taco Bell wouldnt do it this time, even though they did it every time last year.  Pretty much done with taco bell at this point."
0,For the second time this place made unauthorized charges on my credit card after i checked out.  this also happened last year when they accused me of taking a bottle of water from the mini bar and i was billed $40.  Other Las Vegas hotels don't do this!
1,"Let me start this review by saying I'm terrified of dentists. As far as I'm concerned they evoke a terror usually reserved for big toothy sharks in bloody water. So when it became obvious my toothache was not going to get any better it took me a few days to work up the courage to search for one. \n\nI did some checking and knew I wanted a dental office that offered sedation dentistry, and of course one that was trustworthy. I Binged, Googled and checked various sources (including Angie's List) then made an appointment with Reimels Family and Cosmetic Dentistry. They had a good reputation and offered sedation.\n\nI spoke with them and they got me an emergency appointment for later the same day. I went in and once shown back was really just trying to focus on not making a run for daylight, or doing something equally embarrassing. Once Dr. Miller came in he got to work setting me at ease while asking a few questions about my history. Afterward he did a quick check up and a few xrays then informed me (and frankly I'm impressed I handled it so well) that a root canal was in my immediate future. Knowing how well I don't do when it comes to dentists he immediately went right back to work making me feel at ease (and even making me laugh once or twice).\n\nAfter discussions with him, during which time he very patiently answered all my questions and then some, I decided maybe (just maybe) I could do this without sedation. He assured me if I got to the office and felt I couldn't actually do this without sedation we could reschedule at that time (as it takes longer and is a bit more involved). We made an appointment a few days later and he sent me home with some prescriptions to help manage pain until then, plus antibiotics and everything else I needed. I liked this as it allowed me to be totally ready before the day came, so I wouldn't need to go to the pharmacy afterward.\nFast forward to the procedure itself. Everyone was phenomenal! I was made very comfortable (the Reimels facilities are almost spa-like, by the way.. clearly designed around not being 'clinical and intimidating'). Dr. Miller made sure I felt almost nothing during the procedure and while I can't say it was even remotely pleasant it was also not the horrible experience I was bracing for. Every time I indicated I was starting to feel pain the doctor stopped to numb the area more before resuming.\n\nOnce the procedure was finished they gave me the option of a temp filling and going home right away vs. waiting approx. 90 minutes while they fabricate what they need to rebuild and seal permanently. As long as I was there and numb I opted to wait and was made very comfortable. At one point during the wait I was just reading my kindle and actually tapping my feet to the music I had been blasting earlier, and was now listening to at a more normal volume) to drown out the drill. Now that was a surprise when I caught myself doing it - relaxing and tapping my feet to music just minutes after a root canal while I waited for 'round 2', go figure. In total it was a few hours, including the wait for the fabrication, but true to the doctor's word by the time I left the clinic I was worlds better and more or less back to myself. Since arriving home I needed only limited pain meds, which is another plus. It's also very much worth noting that because of the above Dr. Miller actually ended up saving me several hundred dollars on the final cost vs. what I had been advised the total cost would be.\n\nAll and all I'd say I've found a new dentist."
0,"Today I spent 30 minutes on the phone typing 1 for the next menu and the next one and the next one, before I got a live person. Once I finally did, I asked how much office visits generally run, and the woman said she doesn't know because she only handles appointments at that office. She asked where I lived to find the closest office near me, and said the Southeast one was closest. Fine. She puts me on hold for another 5 or 6 minutes, comes back and tells me that the first available appointment is on November 4th. I said \""I could be dead by then.\"" I asked her if she could refer me to a place I could just go to today. She said she only knew about Southwest. I said, \""So when you get sick you wait a month an a half to get treated too?\"" She explained how that's because I'm a new patient. So apparently it's only the new patients they let die. The ones who've already given them money they treat more quickly. Awesome.\n\nI ended up going to UMC Sunset Quick Care...which was AWESOME.\n\nMy suggestion: Take your business and your hacking cough to UMC Sunset, where they actually care about you and take care of you at the time that you need it."
1,"I went with a group of pizza lovers to check this place out. I hail from the land of GREAT pizza, (NY and Philly) so I was pleasantly surprised with finding a good NY pizza place in the land of notoriously bad pizza, aka Las Vegas.\n\nI had the daily special which was around  $8 for 1 pepperoni and 1 cheese slice with a soft drink. The pizza was really good. It could have been hotter but since they were trying to serve 28 of us I think they hurried the process a bit. \n\nThe end crust was way too thick for true NY pizza but not a big deal. There was plenty of seating and the place was really clean. \n\nSome other people in our group were noticing that Joe's did not serve beer which is strange for a Vegas eatery so not sure what happened there. (They booze you up everywhere else in this town).\n\nIf you want a slice of NY pizza this is the best one I have found. So far anyway......"
0,"We sat inside because we didn't want to bake in the July Las Vegas sun, but the patio would be good for people watching.  Inside the music was too loud and while our server was nice, it took a while to get our drinks and food.  I had the carnitas tacos for a late lunch which were pretty tasty, but the meal was small.  The place is pricey especially for drinks.   Luckily I had the Yelp check-in offer for a free house margarita that the wife enjoyed."
0,Came here looking forward to having the kobe beef burger after reading the reviews on yelp...\n\nSoooo very disappointed...\n\nMy burger was way to chewy even though I got it medium.  This was probably the worst kobe burger I've ever had.  But the ironic thing is that my friends regular angus burger tasted much better than mine...
0,"I've only had one pizza here.  I ordered the Margherita for delivery on a Friday night...I wished and I do mean REALLY WISHED I didn't that night.  I was famished and was looking forward to a slice of heaven based on the \""wonderful\"" reviews Ian's Pizza has on Yelp, but holy f*uck was it a disaster it turned out to be!!!  Sauce clumsily spread on, mozzarella not even melted, and whole leaves of basil just tossed on without a damn care on the pizza.  There is no way for me to soften the blow to write this review... the pizza I had was an embarrassment to all pizzas ever made."
0,"...For the record, I have never posted a negative review online...This evening I decided to eat at this Yardhouse location, but the experience was traumatic. Between California and Nevada, I have eaten at this restaurant at least a few dozen times, and general eat the same few options. Getting to the point, upon arrival of the main course, i saw a dark piece of something poking out of the breading of my chicken fingers. Considering I eat these almost every time I eat at Yardhouse, dismantling deemed appropriate. I pulled the breading off and discovered a cockroach /bug type wing and a limb on an insect. The food runner was notified of the incident, and attempted to take the plate back. I denied him, took a photo and requested a manager. The manager (Beau Boskey) assured me it was cabbage, but also denied eating it upon request. At this point, he offered to take that dish off the bill, and shrugged off the entire situation as a misunderstanding. He entirely discrediting my opinion, and I'm a collector of  scientific insect displays. Kind of ironic. Our server came over and apologized about the whole situation. We understood it wasn't her fault, but did let her know that the manager handled the situation wrong(she was tipped). She apparently notified him of my dissatisfaction and conversation of taking this to his upper management/corporate. After Beau, the manager, caught word, he decided to retract his original offer and comp the whole meal. This attempt to appease me was an appropriate gesture, a bit late and an obvious back step. Overall, this restaurant experience will never be forgotten... in a bad way. .........By the way... I looked up deep fried cabbage on google image search and my photo looks very different. gross. \n3/22/13 Update- I was recently offered a free meal and assurance that my experience is going to be used as a training exercise. Obviously, I'll never eat at this place again, and hopefully they figure out how to deal with these situations better in the future."
1,Love their happy hour
1,"I've just landed in Vegas, picked up by my friend, and taken to dinner for some all you can eat sushi. This place is pretty spacious. The rolls were pretty good. Be careful of ordering too much because I think we did. 2 poke salads are not the way to go for a table of 4 when you're trying to eat more rolls. The quality wasn't bad either. It probably isn't the best but by no means is is horrible. If you get a spicy roll, be prepared for major spice!"
1,Love this little gem of a restaurant! Come here for the ambiance and enjoy a special dining experience. The food is excellent. BYOB places are the best. Just bring cash and an empty tummy. Take a look at the pics to imagine what you could be savoring! Yum!
1,I have been coming to ABC for years and I have never had a bad experience. It is a wonderful little sandwich shop and everything is always fresh! \n\nSkip the sandwich chains and go to ABC!
0,"Rude, racist, dark. Unconscious drunk people at the bar or at the entrance smelling like urine. Homeless old men grabbing at my date. Pretty much an assault. Place attracts the detritus."
1,"Angie B was my hairdresser from 1994 until I moved out-of-state in 2008. She is a master with hair dye! My hair was always well cut and impeccably dyed. I did not deserve such a wonderful cut, since I often wore a hat or clipped it up like a slob, but I felt great. Anyway, Angie B and Vanessa own the salon (thus Angessa) and they keep the place feeling very positive and make you feel comfortable.  They cater to the Scottsdale crowd - ie, those that love to get groomed - and they do it without an ounce of pretension! Also, they are not wedded to a specific product line - Angie has experience with everything from Aveda to Redken to Loreal and can and will advise you on what she thinks will work best for you. Also, Angie is fantastic with up-dos and wedding hair. \n\nNote - I really cried when I moved away from Angie; it is not easy to find a hairdresser that knows your hair well."
1,Visit the sushi place. Freshest sashimi in town. Great portions. Highly recommended. \nManager is awesome.
1,"Great experience at the Omni Mont-Royal during our three night stay in Montreal. The entire staff is friendly, helpful and competent. Special kudos to the male concierge who works during the day. He is very knowledgeable about the city, patient with all kinds of questions, and even helpful about what to do on a rainy day. Thanks to everyone at the hotel for making our stay enjoyable."
0,"Terrible steaks and sub-par ribs.  Avoid this place!!!!  Out of 17 of us, no one had a good meal. We complained and the offered to fix our steaks, but they came back even worse.  We complained to the manager and all they would do is offer a dessert.  We did not accept."
0,"I like the new look but hate the confusing new set up. It's all, \""I'm a buffet, but nope no I'm not!\"" \nOrdered the 1/4 white chicken with mashed potatoes & bacon & onion Mac & cheese. Comes with complimentary bread. Chicken was good and moist. Mashed potatoes have no taste and Mac & cheese is dry without the slightest taste of cheese! Tried the cornbread which is so dry it literally leaves a gritty residue in your mouth. The focaccia bread is on the oily side and the batch we got was way overloaded with rosemary. Also got the fettuccine pomodoro which is cooked fresh to order and wasn't bad but definitely nothing I'd order again. I like the new look but definitely not the new food."
1,"It's Panda. Not as fresh food, they cook more when it runs out, but it meets my expectations so they get 5 stars.\n\nFill out the survey on the back of the receipt to get a free item on your next visit.\n\nI bought the $25 gift cards around Christmas time and got the free 2 item meal. nice deal for sure."
1,"My husband and I have been here several times already and like this place. We have always been greeted promptly at the door & seated quickly. We have had Kaitlin several times as our server and has always been on top of things. \nThe food has been pretty good too! This last time we ordered and shared a house salad, the blackened chicken quesadilla and the venison chili burger. The favorites for me were the fresh & crisp house salad and the quesadilla. The venison burger was good but I wasn't a fan of the chili on top of it. \nIn the past we've had the meaty wings, the Philly cheesesteak, Poblano Chicken as entrees. We've also had a large group here where we passed appetizers. The fried pickles, pork sliders & mozzarella sticks were all a big hit.  \nOne of these times I'm going to get Mom's Pot Roast. The smell alone makes your mouth water. \nAs far as beverages, you can go wrong with a frozen mug of beer. My personal favorite is the Knotty Brunette. A great amber beer which you can get lady or man size. \nBeing this location has had the hardest time keeping occupants I'm glad to see something here that will stay for quite some time."
1,"We have been to Leroy Fox several times and our most recent visit was a couple nights ago.  We were seated quickly upon arrival and the server took our drink order right away. It was fairly crowded for a Tuesday night.  The place has a comfortable feel. There are booths, tables, and you can sit at the bar. Behind the bar are many TVs.  My wife and mother-in-law ordered the fried chicken.  I had the chicken fried steak and my son had the BBQ sandwich and my daughter had the mac and cheese. A couple, pieces of the fried chicken were not cooked thoroughly so we sent it back. Two entire meals were returned to us and they comped our desserts.  They handled the situation perfectly. Things can happen once in a while anywhere but the way it is handled is what counts the most and Leroy Fox knows customer service better than most. The food was very good. My daughter loves the mac and cheeses and my chicken steak was delicious.  The asparagus and fries are also good. The desserts were tasty too.  The food, service and ambiance are all reasons to return to the Fox.  It is a good value too."
0,"Wanting to try a new popcorn place since my favorite \""Popcorn Girl\"" is further from my house, I tried this out. \n\nIn comparison, the popcorn is much lighter than Popcorn Girl and more subtle. Not sure if that's good or bad, depending on your preference but I do tend to feel a little less guilty eating this. It appears it's been lightly seasoned vs the other which seems covered in butter and seasonings-but who knows the real ingredients at each place. \n\nWhat bothered me was the worker. She was nice as can be letting me try whatever I wanted and was giving me her opinion on flavors, which was appreciated.  Whenever I tried one flavor, she stuck her hand inside the bucket bare hands and all, no gloves, no scooper and grabbed a few pieces and ate it while I ate my sample and when I asked her questions she had food in her mouth, I almost felt like I had to wait for her to finish chewing and swallowing before asking for another sample. She must have done this with 5 plus different flavors. Mind you, when I first walked in she did not wash her hands (like how they do at Subway or Golden Spoon, you actually see the employee wash their hands in front of you). I saw the sink, but no hand wash. I wouldn't mind the no hand wash if she had gloves, but to stick her bare hands in the tub of popcorn and munch on popcorn seemed inappropriate and unsanitary. \n\nIf you like Dole Whip, theirs tastes like the real thing but the amount you get for $2.50 is about 5 bites maybe 6? It's small."

0,"After attending Tryst 4 times, including bottle service, I have to regrettable give a bad review.\nThe security is biased to a women's perception of events. My good friend who has participated in all 4 previous bottle services was interrogated and escorted out of tryst for being hit in the face. He was hit in the face! He did not provoke the situation, but was accidentally a bystanders. \nEven the alleged victim stated my friend had not committed the violation. \n Sadly, he was escorted out because the casino follows procedure to prevent possible law suits from the victim.\n\nSo, the Winn would rather offer subpar customer service that take a chance at possible lawsuit. No proof was ever shown. \n\nI regret to say that I will never partake in any Winn/Encore events or clubs.\n\nYou have lost a loyal customer. Consider re-evaluating your protocol in situations like this."
1,"I'm not the biggest burger fan, which may be why I am hesitant to give five stars. That being said, their unique burger combinations are SO good and the burgers are always juicy. They have a great beer selection, and good Bloody Mary and mimosa specials on Saturdays and Sundays. Service has always been good. I wish there were more options than burgers and salads though, as you are slightly limited if you're not in the mood for a burger. But if that's the case you should probably not go to a burger joint! Have yet to try their breakfast, but am really looking forward to it!"
1,best wings in Scottsdale!!! hands down.
0,"Worst bar I've been to, period. It looks awful, smells awful, and the nastiest, warmest beer on tap that I've ever drank came from KAMS. On top of that, the clientele are awful, too, unless you're looking to meet the most obnoxious people in the whole city when they're in full bar crawl mode."
0,"The food took an eternity to arrive. There were 4 tables, myself included, and it took an hour to bring out 4 dishes to our table. \n\nThe food is pretty good, but don't come here if you don't have 2 hours."

0,"Decided to try Flemings as I was hungry for a sizzling steak and an earthy glass of wine.  What a disappointment.  Wine pour was short.  Salad was plain and simple.  And, my steak was overdone yet mushy.\n\nI'm a foody and expect the best.  I'll be passing on Flemings in the future.  T-BONES is MUCH better in every way."
0,"I came here for brunch before the steelers game with a few friends. I had an omelette and my friend had scrambled eggs with toast potatoes sausage and bacon and we tried the donut. The donut was not cooked , literally not cooked at all. We asked for butter and other condiments  and he never returned with them. He was basically nonexistent. Also, everything was extremely salty! Don't eat the potatoes, they made me sick. This was my second experience here and I definitely won't be returning."
1,"I'm  going to stop being such a taker, and give for once! I use Yelp along with other reputable websites to help make my dining, travel and shopping decisions and I never take the time to give back!! I know, I know....awful. I'm turning over a new leaf! Here is my first Yelp. Please don't judge. It's my first time.... Okay, here goes. So, I went to Matt's for the first time a few days ago....\n\nFood- Amazing.  Best pancakes ever! I'm not sure what the secret ingredient is but they are beyond good! Fluffy little cakes of love. I also tasted the butter burger. Very, very, yummy. If you decide to dine here make sure you try the bacon. I don't think I've ever tasted anything like it. Sweet, savory and cooked just right.\n\nThe building is very small, the wait is extra long and make sure you don't overindulge on the free refills of ice tea because there is NO BATHROOM!! The seating is cramped and the service is rushed, but the food is worth dealing with Matt's shortcomings."
0,"Service terrible - hostess was rude and took forever to get a waitress, the menu is not appropriate for children - many menu names X RATED. \nThe atmosphere is beautiful dark woods and reds. If they paid as much attention to their food and their customers as they did the decor, it would be a 10."
0,"I wish there was an option for ZERO stars. Seriously the WORST post office ever. This is the third time this month this has happened so I thought I'd leave a review. We live in a condo with a normal address and for some reason our postman/woman has sent back THREE packages to the original place we ordered from for \""incomplete address\"". Probably because they are too lazy to walk it into the office. Never had this problem before. And had to pay for shipping again due to our mail person being a lemming.\n\nUPDATE: 2 weeks later and they have lost ANOTHER package. Why am I not surprised?!"
0,"Hmmmmm the sandwich I had was pretty damn good. But it seems as though that I was the only one that could have eggs on my sandwich though. \n\nThe place was dead and yet they had no eggs. I felt bad for my friend Meg who couldn't get eggs on his sandwich. The coffee I got was huuuuuuge. \n\nI did also feel that for a sandwich, large coffee, and muffin that $13 is a bit much. \n\nI also didn't really care for the workers changing the music to something that they wanted to hear. I was getting into the classic rock that was on but then it was gone and Three Days Grace was bumping. \n\nSorry not sorry."
1,"The place has some killer subs.  I always get La Canna, it's the Italian and comes with a big juicy pickle, hold the blk olives plz.  I feel uplifted somehow every time I go in there, maybe it's all the weed posters.  Employees are SUPER SUPER friendly.  Tuna is in need of a serious upgrade to albacore, would be awesome because the ranch is killer too.  Stir it up and try this place."
1,The whole process from start to finish was pretty easy. They came when they said they would and gave me a reasonable price. I had them cut the front and back yard gras and they did a pretty good job. They left everything looking very neat and clean.
0,"My dinner was on June 8th 2014. I will typically give a place a 2nd chance if the first isnt what was expected. In this case we are talking about a Vegas, and you only get one shot to impress and hope people spread the word about your Steak house. My wife and I decided to have dinner here after we watched the Michael Jackson show in the hotel. The host escorted us to the table and said a server will be with us shortly. (no problem) 10 mins goes by and nobody is yet to stop by our table. Finally the same host saw that we hadn't been helped. So he brings up a dinner and drink menu. Takes our order for the drink and they come. Now we are just back to sitting around waiting for our server to come by.  I then pull out my cell phone and start the stopwatch on it. 23 MINS later our server comes by. Proceeds to tell us about the menu. At this point my wife and I had 33 mins to decide on what we wanted for dinner. We were ready to order. We place our order and move on. The food finally comes out (another server brings it to us). I had to ask that server for the Fries that come on the house because our server never came back or brought them. I ordered the 16oz NY Strip and my wife ordered the Filet Mignon. My steak was \""good\"" at best, certainly wasnt a USDA Prime Steak. We shared the Potatoe Gratin. That was about the only good thing about this place. I could go on but I was very disapointed in everything at Stripsteak. I'll stick to my local place, Peterson's Steakhouse in Indianapolis."
0,"The decor is nice but not quite up to Bellagio standards.  Overall the food was so-so, but when you consider the high prices, very disappointing.  The rolls were horrible and the sashimi although tasty and fresh disappointed because the portion size was so small.\n\nWe did not overindulge and the cost per person was $150.  Unfortunately there was nothing memorable about the dining experience."
1,"Tana has been a blessing in my life. I have been seeing her for over 4 years off and on now. When ever I need her, she is there to give me positive support and a lifetime of wisdom I can use to get me through the rough times. I appreciate her and definitely recommend choosing Tana as your Life Coach :) No doubt"
1,"I can confidently say this will be my newest \""go to\"" spot in the neighborhood. Prior to actually eating here, I had visited Grassroots Kitchen & Tap for just drinks. The drinks were made well and the prices seemed fair. They have a pretty good selection of wines bottled & on tap. The beers average about $6 but you can get a pitcher for about $12. It's a great deal and even better if you go during happy hour. The bar has a great atmosphere and the bartenders are all very friendly. After a few fun experiences of just hanging out at the bar, I finally actual got a chance to eat here this weekend! It was AMAZING! \n\nFirst we started with their soup of the day, Black Bean Sirloin Chili. We ordered a side of bread to go with it so we could all share it as an appetizer.. It was the perfect way to start our meal. Lots of flavor and they don't skimp on the sirloin portions. For dinner I had the Vegetable Platter, my husband had the Half Chicken, my mom had the BBQ Brisket, and my dad had the Short Ribs. The Vegetable platter was shockingly very filling and had tons of flavor. I was afraid I would miss eating meat for dinner, but I ended up not missing it at all. It was perfect! The kale had a great garlicky flavor and the tomatoes and blue cheese mix is now one of my favorite flavor combinations that I'm definitely going to try to mimic at home. I got to taste a bite of all the dishes my family ordered too had they were all great. The chicken was super moist and had a slight sweetness in flavor. The ribs & brisket were both tender and booming with flavor as well. \n\nWhere this restaurants loses a star is because of the sides. Aside from my vegetable platter, All the other side dishes were really lacking in flavor and added nothing the main course. The grits seemed a little mushy and didn't have the flavor your would expect from the Jalepeno. The orzo was just average too. In fact, everyone cleaned their plates of the meats but no one really touched their sides. They kept eating the kale and tomatoes off my plate. The next time I go, I might ask if I can get the kale with my main course instead of the grits or orzo.\n\nOverall I loved it here. I can't wait for a chance to go back and so excited to have a new place in the neighbor I can stumble home from."
0,"The food here was good, but the prices are outrageous.\n\nI am by no means stingy, and I was expecting to pay a little more for a gourmet pizza... But $17 for a 12\"" diameter pizza with a couple pieces of prosciutto on top? Never again. It's a shame, because I did like the pizza and it would be nice to have a good Italian-style pizza every once in a while.\n\nThe gelato is really good, so I'll just stick to that in the future."
0,"Tried again in vain to patronize the Fletcher Tire & Auto organization. Called to make an appointment and once again, at this location was asked when I wanted to come in and then told sorry, can't do it. It was 2 days in advance!

1,"Agree with the previous great reviews.  Based on those reviews, I went by there and got a battery for my watch.  Quick and easy and they are so incredibly nice and personable.  You can join an email list for monthly emails of coupons or specials and to make this place even sweeter....it is right next to a walk up/drive through Starbucks.  A win win if you ask me!"

0,"We called TNP to replace two gates in our yard. Jimmy showed up on time, and the work was done quickly. He made gates very similar to a photo I chose off the internet, and they were installed very quickly. That's where the positive experience ended. Our front gate is hung crooked. When my husband pointed this out to him, he stated that it's because the wall that it attaches to isn't level. That may be the case, but being as we aren't the experts, I'd prefer to have the expert point that out to us while doing the work, rather than us discover it and feel like something is being hidden from us.\nThe back gate was obviously not measured for properly, and there is a 5.5\"" gap between the ground and the bottom gate. Our two small dogs can easily squeeze under this gap so now we have some lovely bricks underneath our brand new gate to keep that from happening. To pay a good amount of money for 2 gates that aren't secure now and aren't level is SUCH a waste of money. We asked him to come out to fix at least the back gate, which instead of him remeasuring and making a correct-sized gate meant cutting the frame and moving the gate down (not my idea of making the job right), but he never showed up on the scheduled day. Didn't call either. It's very disappointing that most contractors don't put pride into their work, and seem to get away with taking your money for a shoddy job."
0,"Honestly, I've never written one of these... but after last night I felt that I needed to tell the world how awful this place is.\n\nI went with my boyfriend and thought \""hey, cool design, specialized menu, should be good!\"" I was wrong. \n\nProbably because I'm Italian and grew up eating really good Italian food, but this is crap. I had the speck pizza. It was dry, overly salty and sort of all-around gross. He had the Alfredo with spaghetti. Where do I even start? The pasta was hard- no. not al dente. Way undercooked. The sauce was lumpy with bits of cooked eggs in it and tasted like jarred sauce with eggs and butter added... Not good.\n\nThe ambience was cool and the wait staff while very friendly, had no idea what anything on the menu was. We had two simple questions (What kind of cheese is on the pizza and what was the soup of the day) both of which he blatantly said he didn't know and would get back to us.. never did.\n\nIf you're going for drinks, hell yes! The drinks were fun and the ambience is great, so it really is ideal for 5 a 7 with friends, but this place SUCKS as a resto. Will not be returning, at least not for dinner."
1,"I have never had Cantonese before and was taken here by a friend who was born and raised in China. This helped a lot, as he could speak the language (only with a differen dialect). I loved that they walked past with carts, so you could actually see the food. They would explain what each plate had and what was in each dish. \n\nI liked the shrimp (don't know how else to say this, so excuse me) balls. They were cooked well and very tasty. There were things that looked like wontons with chicken and spinach in them, that were very good. The tea was okay, but the servers were definitely on their job; constantly checking on my drinks, but not in an annoying way. Tried this rice that was in a giant leaf thing, didn't care for the flavor. Had this dessert that was made with sweetened egg, and it was delicious! I also liked that the portions were small, so you could try multiple things. \n\nMy friend said that there was some pressure from the women with the carts, so I'm not sure if they work on commission, or maybe they need to empty their carts in a certain amount of time, or what. If he were not a confident man, I'm sure this would have made for an uncomfortable vibe, but him and I laughed it off. Will definitely be coming here again."
0,"Never again.\n\nI am a big fan of the MGM Properties and I am an elevated Member of the Mlife Players Club, so when I was told I could get an upgraded room here at the Excalibur for basically next to nothing.  I just had to jump on it.\n\nBig Mistake.\n\nAmenities that were promised in the suite were not there, had to call for it but never got there.  Part of the cabinet in the sink was broken, even had the house keeping supervisor come and take a look at it, and she said she'd call engineering on Day 1.  On Day 3 when I left still broken.  A/C didn't work either, the controls had ran out of battery so I called guest service to fix it.  Apparently they took the controls off the wall, and then cracked open the protective case for the AC unit, then and only then could I control the AC unit.\n\nThe facility itself is a bit rustic, but I mean I guess it goes with the theme.  The cleanliness of it when I went down to gamble on the floor and on the sports book, well you can tell it's been wiped down, but nothing had been scrubbed.  \n\nI would definitely take a look at other properties in the MGM chain because I am a fan, but yeah not staying here again."
1,"Best italian food in Las Vegas. It is so tasty.....\n\nWhatever you do, you MUST order the cheese garlic bread with the marinara sauce.....trust me your life will be complete without it.\n\nNow they say that their small serves 2 or more people..., Honestly, I'd say after eating the cheesy bread that could serve 4 or more people...so much food.\n\nThe customer service was delightful as well which always makes me happy :D"
0,"I was dying for some drunken noodles, saw this place close and gave it a go.  They open at 11, I tried 1058, no one there realized how early and killed time at the dollar store, came back at 1114, still not open, started to leave and someone ran to the door to unlock it, still had her purse on so I know she just walked in the door.  I ordered takeout drunken noodles and asked how long it might be since I know they just walked in, 5 min.  I didn't know whether to be happy or scared.  How could that be ready in 5 min? It was obvious they took old stuff and just re fried it, pretty greasy and nothing tasted fresh.  I am not one to know authenticity, but I had some drunken noodles in San Diego that I am trying to find something similar here.  This is my 3rd round with the noodles and just a few other times eating Thai apart from that, but this was my worst for sure out of all of them.  I don't know Thai food real well, but I know fresh, and I didn't get anything fresh here.  Also, smelled like old lady moth balls"
1,"We bought pre-sale tickets for Afrojack. Tickets for guys was $30 and gals it was $20. Venue is pretty cool, inside you could see the dj and the dance floor, lights. Lots of places to sit and stand around. It gets crowded but you could go outside and enjoy fresh air, dip your feet in the water as well. Drinks are expensive as to be expected, but really a fun atmosphere and vibe. Lights not as good as Hakkasan, but more room to move around and it was interesting people watching. We had a great time."
1,"While driving around on Christmas Eve looking at Christmas lights we passed by the Eastside Cannery and decided to see what they had to eat.\n\nAfter looking at the menu at Snaps we knew this would be the place to try something new. It is decorated with a 1960's feel. \n\nThe hostess greeted us and seated us right away. It was just after 8 pm and they were pretty busy. I was at least given a menu to look over but it took 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and get our drink order. It was frustrating but since it was Christmas Eve and they did appear busy I figured it might not always be like that.\n\nWe started off with \""Idaho Potato Wedges\"" that only cost $3.99. It had Shredded Cheddar, Sour Cream, Chopped Bacon, and Green Onions on the wedges. You will get way more then you thought for the price and they taste great.\n\nSince it was so cold outside I thought the \""Homemade French Onion Soup\"" sounded comforting. It was! The portion was perfect and the Swiss Cheese was just bubbling over the top. Under the cheese a very thick bread that soaked up and held up nice considering all of the yummy cheese on top of it. The broth had a very deep flavor and the onions were so flavorful. It only cost $4.50!!!\n\nMy man had what they call a \""Monster Burger\"". It has Fried Egg, Onion Rings, Cheddar Cheese and Pastrami. He had them leave the egg off. He said the burger could have been seasoned better but the pastrami was very good. \n\nThe inside was clean and the staff friendly.\n\nYou can choose booth or table. They have some bigger tables for larger parties. \n\nThey serve beer and wine. There is a bar and they have plenty of tvs to watch sports on.\n\nIf you are hankering for some Chinese food they have a separate Chinese menu!\n\nAt one end of the bar you will notice the take out sign for all to go/pick up orders.\n\nCheck the website for the Cannery to see the deals/promotions they have going on in Snaps. They currently have a few very good meal specials. \n\nI'm so glad we tried Snaps! We will for sure be back!"
1,"I'm a junior at ASU and drove past this place on university for THREE years until I finally went in....that was a mistake.  Now I go there whenever I can.   Though while on the outside, it looks like just a chain bagel place, its way more than that.  Chompies sandwiches taste just like (to me) some of the best Jewish delis Ive been to in NYC...honestly, its that good.\n     My faves:\n         **Jewish Sliders-What Chompies is best known for (as well as featured on Man VS Food for), a very hearty combo of 3 cholla rolls filled brisket, mini potato pancakes & Jack cheese, and a side of gravy. THE BEST Sandwich I have had in Arizona, hands down.\n          **The Brooklyner Triple Decker-(pastrami, corned beef, and braised brisket on double baked Jewish rye).  It has it all, the only thing I do to it is ask the server to add coleslaw too it which puts it over the top"
0,"we went to STFK for the first and unfortunately the last time tonight. I'm not sure if they hired an outside company to come up with this concept or they thought of it internally, but they can save a ton of money by NOT remodeling the remaining stores, and will stop losing long time customers like us.  I always finished up with their chili, but now it's an additional $3.49, and no more hot chocolate chip cookies. BTW, no more coupons either, so it's time to look for another place to have a healthy meal..."
0,"I came to this auto service thinking they were dependable and cheaper having so many branches in the city. Wrong. They quoted me $100 which my dealership would have charged.  I assumed since I am the only customer there that it would be quick since I am going out of town right after this last task of changing my oil.  They took 45 minutes to take my car in the back then take another 45 minutes to tell me they don't have the air filter in stock so they have to get it at my dealership. I have already told them I am going out of town and that I am in a rush but they weren't concerned about that. I said I would just get the oil change done at my dealership since the price isn't different and the simple fact it would take longer now. They said they drained the oil out so I couldn't drive it and that I was stuck. What kind of mechanic dissembles a car before checking on tools/stock? They just wanted my money and weren't going to let me leave without it. I was upset and asked why it took them over an hour and half to communicate anything to me and now leave me stranded. They didn't have any answers for me except that someone is on their way to get the air filter. I wait another hour now over 3 hours. I ask what the status is and they weren't concerned with making me feel better about this situation just satisfied that I have to pay them. Finally almost 4 hours later the car is done and I still had to pay $100.  They even smirked stating they could have charged me more.  Do not EVER go here, they have a teenager working the front desk and a bitter Asian lady dodging all customers letting the kid take care of everything. Disgusting."
0,I'm a lesbian. I went on a Wednesday...They had two for one drinks.....One miller lite is $9.....Um.....yea I don't think so. I went to bars and clubs where bottle service is a must...where you spend a thousand dollars in one night. But Krave is not the kind of club it's so small. The gogo dancers were eh....ok....\nI was there for an hour and then over it!\nSorry Krave I just wasn't wowed. I don't think it was worth the cover....or the drink prices.
0,"Costomer service experiences since arrival:\n* The Hide-a-Way bar was closed today due to short-staffing, but no one took the initiative to post a notice to guests.\n* I called the front desk to ask for pick-up service for dry cleaning. There was an annoyed, \""that's the bell hop, I'll transfer you.\"" I was then transferred to what sounded like the bell hop manager's desk line, \""you've reached so-n-so, please note my hours are Monday and Tuesday mornings, Wednesday late evenings...\""\n* When manually calling the bell hop at noon for next-day dry cleaning service, got \""same-day service has gone out today. You had to get it picked up by 9:30am.\"" This is Vegas, who is up that early? I asked if they could pick it up for the next day so I wouldn't oversleep the deadline and they huffingly said they'd send someone.\n* Don't try to take the towels out of the pool area. \""That's Laundry's policy.\"" Who is this unreasonable \""Laundry\"" who gets their kicks from freezing cold people dashing mostly naked through hotels?\n* Like some third world country, wireless is NOT considered a basic service. It'll set you back $12 per day.\n* Their gym (which is probably piss-poor anyway) is $20 per day. \n\nBesides poor customer service, the place really isn't that bad. Rooms are pretty clean, but the Rush Tower is worth the steeper nightly rate."
1,This is my 'go to' pho house in the Chandler area.  The prices are good ~5 to $6 for a bowl of pho.  The staff is friendly and the quality is on par.  My one complaint is that it is not especially clean.  \n\nMy picks:\n\n#16  spicy beef pho\n\nPho Ga( chicken pho(white meat))\n\nfried tofu
0,Found hair in my sub. We're professional about it and refunded me. Nice and friendly staff
0,Not very clean and rooms smell funny. Not geared for thwarting younger crowd.
0,Shockingly bad food and service. We were with a private paryt upstairs so maybe that was the reason for agonizingly slow service but there's zero chance of me returning.
1,"I love this place! They have Boba and Pho style noodle soup! It's low calorie, filling and tastes so good! The staff is all super friendly and it's very chic and modern. I used to live down the street and pop in when I was feeling hungry. Theres a tanning center and a tattoo shop right next door too! It's on University near McClintock and if you know that area it's pretty good. Over all, wonderful!"
0,"I went here a couple of weeks ago, it is brand new and clean. We love the one in town square so i was happy one was opening by my house. Dinner was pretty good for them just opening a week before but i still feel the prices do not match what you get. The worse part was the food poisoning or bug that me & the bf had TWO weeks after this meal. I though the fish tasted extremely fishy and should have sent it back.. But overall, good service & nice location. Never eating here again tho."
1,"I love this store. It's always a quite place to find great cards! I love the quite time I get here reading all the funny cards :) The staff is great too, because they never judge me when I am there reading cards for 45 mins. ! \n\nThe stores have a way better selection than anywhere else and they also have great one of a kind gifts too. Also during the holidays, nothing beats a Keepsake ornament. I can fill a whole Christmas tree with all the Keepsakes I have! \n\nMy mom would always buy, send and give Hallmark cards and that has just been something that has stuck with me. I know that nowadays you can find Hallmark cards almost anywhere, but it's not the same as when you actually go to a real Hallmark store. If you haven't been into a Hallmark in awhile or at all it's something to checkout."
0,"A one-star review is a rarity from me.\n\nI was at Westgate and decided to try the place out. OK, the ambiance is decent (and it's a two story restaurant), but...eek!\n\nThe problems are as follows:\n\n-Slim pickings. There's not much in the way of food and much more in the alcoholic department. And when there is food...\n-Food that's just nothing to write home about. The only thing amusing or interesting about the chicken sandwich I ordered was that it seemed to look like a turtle, and not by design, either.\n-Did I see a bird in the place? I know I saw one inside Jobing.com Arena before, but this is a little different.\n\nI'm glad I live in the East Valley, not the West. That's all I have to say."
1,I came here with the kiddos like 4 weeks ago and I really liked how they cut their hair.nice little place in the corner of val vista and southern.
0,"In order to be a kinder and gentler reviewer in these days of rampant nastiness on all social media, my review of last night's attempt at dinner at The Chop Shop will be short and devoid of the spit and vitriol that's so in vogue today. Clean, hip and relaxed. Very, very relaxed. So relaxed in fact that the only order taker spent the better part of 10 minutes on the first 2 in line. They must have been ordering take out for the gang back at the fraternity house. But nay.. I heard one of their totals @ $5.93! The gal taking the order seemed nice enough, pleasant and certainly relaxed as were 3 other guys working there, milling around. Not sure what milling around really means but they were definitely good at it. After the nearly 10 minute wait the line had whittled down to 8ish. Mathematically I envisioned 30-45 minutes just to place our order. Who's got that kind of time? You do the math! If I had more time I'd still find it hard to reward them with my business. Needless to say we left to patronize another of the 1000 dining choices there are in Tempe. I'm sure my experience was an anomaly. So many good reviews from happy patrons, I wish I could say I was one of them. \n\nPS I thought I said this was gonna be a short review.."
1,We had a great Time at a team event. however one of our teammates was hurt pretty bad.I also hit a wall fairly hard and hurt my neck.The staff should recommend the use of the available neck pads to help avoid these type injuries.\nBe very aware of the risk of injury before you do this. It is about the same as playing football with a high school football team.
0,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. First, the service was incredibly slow. There were two tables and two servers, yet we waited many times throughout the meal. Water refills took 12 minutes! I ordered a boba drink and got mysterious clear and gritty boba, complete with a large piece of plastic wrap, yes plastic wrap. The table behind us (the only other table) sent back their rice, as it was served in a dirty bowl.  The food was less than flavorful. We will never be back. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place."
1,"Beautiful course! I love the open layout...great for the waste management tournament. Hole #15 is by far my favorite! Work on your sand game before you play this course, because every hole except #1 has sand. I suggest playing right before or right after the tournament so you can get an amazing experience, with the stands up on hole #16."
0,"Came here for a quick bite to eat while my car was being worked on up the street.... Not one person acknowledged me. Sat at the bar for 10 mins before I had to ASK for a drink/menu.... There were 4 tables in the place. Not busy by any means. The old lady working was\nIncredibly rude to say the least. Margret was very nice, she could tell I was getting heated from sitting there and not being helped. I work in the industry therefore I'm a phenomenal tipper. All I wanted was a beer and a salad.... Going to gecko.\n\nI visit the one in Chandler often, the food is delish and the staff is very attentive. I recommend going to that one. Don't waste ur money here."
1,"As soon as we booked a weekend trip to Montreal, an all-out Saturday night dinner at Liverpool House was put on the agenda for what we hoped would be not only a solid meal but a highlight of our visit. Even coming in with high expectations, Liverpool House was one of the best meals we've ever had.\n\nWe speak very limited French and our waiter was incredibly patient and helpful talking us through a few suggestions based on the meal we were looking to have. He pointed us toward starting with oysters that were so fresh and delicious on their own that they needed no accompaniments despite a really tempting cocktail sauce on the table that begged to be added. An amazing artichoke crostini with a creamy cheese spread across the bread followed and disappeared almost as quickly as it arrived. \n\nFor our main course, we had the Liverpool Steak medium rare - 16 ounces of perfectly cooked meat that will be the standard to which all future steaks are judged. The lobster spaghetti was indulgent even by our standards but considering the plate was practically licked-clean we obviously had no regrets. \n\nWe ended the meal with capuccinos and the only dish of the night that wouldn't qualify as a \""best thing I've ever eaten.\"" Maybe it was the copious amount of food we had already consumed but the Black Forest chocolate cake was forgettable. \n\nAs for drinks, we made our way through the beers \""en f\u00fbt\"" with the American Pale Ale and the IPA really standing out, and just for good measure we went Canadian and had Bloody Caesars which also came with an oyster on top.  \n\nThe service was outstanding, and throughout what turned into a three hour meal (!) the atmosphere fluctuated from lively and boisterous to lower-key and calmer while always managing to retain an intimate feeling throughout. Don't be fooled by any naysayers put off by the chalkboard - Liverpool House was an incredible meal and experience, and with food and service this good they could write the menu on folded origami paper in invisible ink for all I care!"
1,"A group of us went to get pedicures and we were absolutely thrilled!  We had 7 people and I had originally called for an appointment for 5, but they were very gracious and were able to fit all of us in at the same time.  The people there were wonderful and were constantly making sure that we were comfortable and making sure we were having a good experience.   Minh did a fantastic job on my nails and I would recommend him and this salon in a heartbeat."
1,"Fresh squeezed Orange juice..once you've tasted it you'll never be satisfied with what you buy at the grocery store. Difficult to decide what drink to order from their new \""Summer Stiff Sips\"" menu! Today I ordered the \""John Daly Thymly Sage Advice\"", a scrumptious concoction of all herb infused vodka plus Lemonade plus tea. Can't wait for tomorrow when I'll have the Mimosa! My food was the DELICIOUS \""Blind Special\"" , a breakfast sandwich of egg, sausage party, and grilled onions & mushrooms on a pretzel roll and a mixed greens salad.  Beautiful fresh flowers at every table, and friendly staff made my  visit today very memorable.  I will definitely be back soon!"
1,"This place is always packed and loud but the food is good. Its a little on the expensive side but it's the Biltmore and Paradise serves fresher, healthier food than other restaurants so I'll accept that. They do great to customize your order to your specifications. For example, I'm always able to create my own sandwich or get extra cheese on my soup. The reps are helpful if not friendly or overly zealous to attend to you but that could be expected of a place so busy. I always enjoy the free wifi, I didn't think I was a huge Paradise fan until I traveled out of state and was sincerely bummed when I couldn't satisfy my Paradise craving because Paradise isn't in Cali :("
0,"Worst customer service, worst quality, Papa Johns - that's what Papa Johns should change their slogan to."
0,"This is probably one of the worst Olive Garden I have been to. I am a frequent diner at Olive Garden, but had my first experience with this particular one last week. My server was horrific. Being a previous server myself, I can understand the pressures and stress on a busy night. However, this server was completely inattentive and was rushing my friend and I the entire time. Our salads came not even five minutes before our food was sent out. I am completely disappointed. I don't recommend this location to anyone."
0,I never see a reason to go to McDonald's but if you are really looking for one of the cheapest options in MGM than this is the place.  Located in the food court it is actually one of the few options where prices aren't ridiculously marked up to Vegas standards.  If you need to indulge and want to do it like you can do anywhere else in America than I guess you should stop by.
1,"If your on central and do not visit this place, shame on you. Get the chefs whim.  Service may seem slow but it's only because they work so hard to handle everyone equally. Atmosphere is fabulous and the $5 pitchers until 5pm are not a bad deal either.  Come soon and come often."
0,"Sorry, this was way too expensive for what you got. Our waitress was also a bit misleading when we asked her about the size of the tacos(we asked because we'd been to a place the day before that served happy meal size tacos for way too much.)-she said they were big and filling. I'm now wondering if she said that tongue in cheek cause they were tiny and looked like appetizers. \n\nAnd what's the deal with rice and beans that everybody spoons off from a communal plate, for chrissakes gimme my own plate and make it look appetizing instead of a goopy mess in the middle of everyone. \n\nMy friend got a no frills burrito for $14(nothing else) and a $8 margarita , and also felt ripped off.\n\nI gave it two stars because the hostesses were fun to talk to and the 2 mini seabass tacos I had ($13 with nothing else) were actually amazing. Still wouldn't go back or really recommend the place. Too bad the prices and portions were a joke."
1,We had my sister's b-day dinner here. The staff was very accommodating when I told them I was bringing in my own center piece and extra stuff for the table. \nBraised Chicken: this was really good must try if you are going here\nPotato Croquette: theses were ok but I liked the scalloped potatoes better\nPistachio Souffle: this was amazing.\nIf you go here please try the souffles amazing. Your missing out if you pass on dessert. \nWe had already drank too much at the pool and were going to the club after dinner so we did not drink at dinner.\nThe view is amazing as well.
0,"Gilley's is kinda weird.  We ordered Nachos and Soup to split.  The soup average at best and would have been better except for the dried meat chunks.  But it was hot and that's more than we could say for the Nachos.  My first bite had sour cream and I thought that's what was cold but my wife Hates sour cream and she said the same thing, avoiding it of course.  I stuck my finger straight into the center and sure enough, cold to the center.  I wish I had taken a picture.  The shredded cheese on top hadn't even melted.  They were kind enough to remove it from the bill but after acting like they might not at first.  I don't trust a kitchen to fix me more after something like that.  The weird part didn't bother me as much but my wife felt strange walking in because they have a sign having you follow the footsteps and it leads you through the dancing and party area.  You can tell lots of add-on construction has been done over the years.  Might be time for a total redo."
0,I cannot for the life of me understand the hype with this place. The meat is unseasoned and all of their topping are so basic I could probably do a better job just cooking at home. There is absolutely nothing about this place that makes it worth going to and I think people need to stop jumping on bandwagons just because they can.
1,"Swanky yet comfortable bar adjacent to the lobby of the Delano (formerly Mandalay's THE Hotel) on the south strip. Nice environ with knowledgeable bartenders serving craft beers and mixologist cocktails. It's tucked away, allowing patrons to mingle in the shadows while enjoying a nice drink or two. Not a destination in itself, but a good place to catch a drink or two while waiting for the real Vegas festivities to commence. Also note: Franklin. . .at the Delano. . .like the former President Roosevelt."
0,Delivery took forever.  Pizza wasn't hot and barely any toppings on it.  Domino's is way better.
1,"The pancakes are delicious. I had the blueberry lemon poppy seed pancake with the whipped cream cheese topping, it was great. I would put the whipped cream cheese on everything. I also had the veggie burger. It was good but I think the breakfast here is awesome:)"
0,"Decent place, but the drinks are too expensive unless its a buy 1 get 1 night."
0,"Being in a good area of Henderson and having the name it does - I had high hopes for this place. I was craving a cheese enchilada plate for days. I went here for my fix.\n\nFirst of all...8 dollars and change for cheese and tortillas and a scoop of canned beans....RIDICULOUS!\n\nSecond - When I asked for sour cream on my refried beans - she charged me....I think 90 cents? Wow. \n\nSidenote - When the girl took my money - there didnt appear to be a cook in the back - and she, herself went back into the \""kitchen\"" (which looked more like a pizza assembly line with old toppings)...she threw all the ingerdients together in about one minute)\n\nThird - When I received my food, I was SO excited to enjoy it that when I got home and saw pretty much just a styrofoam box with brown bean goop in it....I was frightened of even eating it.\n\nThey put refried beans ONTO my two cheese enchiladas. The cheese inside the tortillas wasnt melted....the tortillas themselves were tasteless and soggy. The beans were bland and COMPLETELY tasteless.  AND to boot - there was no sauce (red sauce - traditional and AMAZING when done right) and I literally could not imagine someone making a WORSE plate of \""enchiladas\"" if they TRIED! I wanted a refund so badly but since I was home watching a movie after a long day it wasnt even worth stepping foot in there again. \n\nI dont know about any of the other menu items at this place - but the cheese enchiladas are absolutely DISGUSTING. Most disappointing mexican food I have ever had.\n\nAlibertos or Faustos for me, next time."
1,"I've always loved cattivo, in that sort of neighborhood bar kind of way. I've never really gone here looking to meet girls, so I can't speak to that, and I tend to drink early and leave before it gets crowded. Maybe that's why I like it so much. The bartenders are nice and the happy hour crew is a good mix. They'll make me a pizza or a calzone with no cheese, and that's kind of a big deal for me. Their dough is my kind of perfect -- crispy on the outside and not greasy, but chewy. Ever since they made the switch to mixed greens instead of iceberg lettuce, the salads have become a meal on their own. I don't come here as much these days (living on the top of the hill and no longer having a girlfriend who lives right across the street), but I sometimes miss those days."
1,"Truly a hidden gem in a sea of abundant over priced, mediocre restaurants with a view of the strip to boot! Four of us came with large appetites expecting some delicious food.  We were not let down.\n\nBaramundi in lobster sauce was AMAZING.  I actually licked the plate clean, the baramundi was perfectly fried, not overly greasy maintaining an epic crunch throughout the entire meal.  The cream sauce was flavorful, but not too sweet.  The lobster won-tons on top were just icing on top of an already fantastic meal.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nMy friends had ordered the salmon, pork chops, and duck.  Everything was cooked to perfection and extremely yummy.  \n\nA little hard to find, but worth the effort, you will not be disappointed.  Ask for a booth next to the window and enjoy the view."
0,"Went here for our anniversary, which lands on St. Patty's Day, so to avoid the mayhem of Guinness chugging, we ate in the Stone House rather than the Stable Grill. \n\nSadly, the best part of my meal was the warm muffins that they serve in lieu of rolls(that day it was Irish Oatmeal and Raisin). They were so moist and yummy...but then it just went down from there. I chose one of the three meals they offer for around $17 that comes with a cup of soup and a glass of wine--which I have to admit is a nice price. The soupwas good, but the salad I had him order so we could trade was SWIMMING in low-quality blue cheese dressing. My chicken and biscuits were disappointing as well. The biscuit was overdone, and the rest was an over salted gelatinous...thing. He liked his pretzel crusted fish(perch, I think), but we both agreed that the Parmesan potato(a wad of cheesy hash browns) was undercooked, and cool in the middle. Hm. We were both glad we didn't get any of the pricier entrees, in case the quality was on the same level. \n\nAfter our meal, we did go through the wine cave and tunnel to the Stable Grill and thought it would be a good place for drinks and apps. \n\nAll in all, not a place I'm going to be dropping my money at, though."
0,"This is definitely the place to be if you are in your 20s because the night life is AWESOME... However, the rooms are ancient and overpriced, I would definitely just visit, and stay somewhere else... You have to pay for everything! I swear the chairs would collapse underneath you if you don't deposit a money on the hour every hour.  You have to pay for Internet....you have to pay $25 for gym access-but apparently you can talk your way down. Finally, you don't get a discount in their clubs for staying in their rooms (during the week you are allowed free access, but the weekend is what most people come for)."
0,"Like the big divide between cat people and dog lovers, I think that there is as big a divide between those who favour Chinese food and those who prefer Indian cuisine.  My personal preference is Indian and I could live without Chinese so take that into consideration when reading this if you are an avid Chinese food fan.  \n\nJimmy Chungs Chinese buffet - it does exactly what it says on the tin.  This restaurant is good if you want a s!\u00a3$ lot of food fast!  As soon as you walk in you're handed a plate and in the middle of the room there are bars with hot plates of food ready for the taking.  They have one bar with starters, a couple dedicated to main courses, a sushi bar, desert area including a chocolate fountain and even an area serving Eastern food like chicken nuggets.  \n\nThis place offers just about everything that is on a normal menu in a Chinese restaurant, if not more!  From good old sweet and sour chicken to crispy duck, from oyster in black bean sauce to deep fried prawns.  I was a bit wary of trying the seafood however I'm pleased to report that I was fine the next day if not still full from my four plates load that I demolished the night before!!!  \n\nThe good thing is you can help yourself and have as much or as little as you want and no one will think bad of you because lets face it, everyone piles their plates as high as they can at these sort of places!  At \u00a36.49 per adult and \u00a34.49 for kids at lunch times, \u00a310.99 for adults and \u00a35.49 kids at dinner time then \u00a311.99 and \u00a36.99 at the weekends it isn't too bad!  \n\nNot the highest quality of Chinese food but at this place you really can't complain."
0,"The service was good. My wife enjoyed her burger. I had the South side slopes. I don't know what Maxim Magazine saw in this sandwich to rate it #5. The home made chips that come with the sandwich were not crispy at all and under seasoned. There is however a great selections of beer to choose from, and a staggering amount of draft options. Maybe next time I will go to drink and eat bar food. There are several better options locally for dinner."
0,"Order from ANYWHERE else but here. Seriously! Especially if you're thinking about ordering delivery. \n\nWeekdays - 2+ hours. \nWeekends - worse.\n\nIf you're starving real bad, can't think straight, hear your stomach making noises you haven't heard before... still DO NOT order from here!"
1,"I love going to see Mary. She's very good at what she does and caters facials etc to your needs and skin type. Also, always on time and very clean business. I've been getting my waxing and all skin care needs from Mary for years and will never trust or go to anyone else."
0,"They have a tough time here with the lunch rush.  You HAVE to go at off hours, get there 11:45 or 12:45 but not in between because you will wait.  And when you finally get your table, if you all get sushi it will come out at the same time.  If you all get stir fry dishes they will come out at the same time.  But if half the table gets stir fry and the other gets sushi then GOOD LUCK.  Our stir fry eaters were completely done eating by the time our sushi came out.  There was only one sushi chef on duty. For the lunch rush you need to be prepared!!!  \n\nThey do have daily sushi specials (the Tsunami roll recently....uh a little 'tongue in cheek' guys?) and the Volcano Roll.  They will run you about 8 or 9 bucks per roll.  The rolls were put together so fast that they were sploppy and loose so it was hard to pick them up and dip them but overall not bad tasting....  \n\nThe stir fry dishes are your MSG delight, portion sizes are ok and they come with an egg roll."
0,"Don't go here. The food came out cold and was way overpriced. Cheaper and tastier meals are everywhere in Vegas, so don't give this place another thought. I would suggest going to Panda Express for a more authentic experience. Yes, Panda Express = More Authentic Experience.\n\nFor a city filled with Asian gamblers, it was odd to see no other Asian person dinning at an Asian restaurant (always a big negative in my book). Maybe their frequent game play has given then enough comps to dine elsewhere, so I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt as far a demographically biased portion of my rating goes.\n\nI ordered the prix fixe menu where the main course was braised sea bass. The sea bass was more boiled than braised. It was texturally unappealing and had no flavor. The greens that accompanied it were overcooked and essentially dead. \n\nI really should have just gone to the food court...."
1,"This review is for how those of us mere mortals do it.  Which means, no twenty dollar tricks, no upgrades, no casino comps...just flat-out booking it myself, albeit through Priceline.  I do love a deal, and I did indeed get a good one.  Won this 5-star for just $85 per night for two nights.  That was just ten dollars a night more than I paid for a 3-star in Boise the night before. Just sayin'.\n\n   LOVES:  Location!  Center strip, convenient  tram to Monte Carlo and Bellagio.  Love being in the shiny new City Center.\n\n   Loved the room!  Having booked via a pre-paid site, I didn't expect suite miracles or incredible views.  What we got was a great 5-star quality 4th floor room.  It was clean and comfy and just plain nice-as-heck.  Certainly nicer than where we live, so we're all about appreciating it!\n\n  QUIET...never heard neighbors...then again, maybe they were all on the higher floors with posh views and suites.  Who knows? We were quite happy with our mere mortal room.  Rest assured that if you are of the higher mortal category,  they offer different elevator bays for those staying on differing floors.  You will be whisked up quickly to your appropriate level.  We were a-ok with ours.\n\n  Here are my reasons for not giving Aria 5-stars...when we checked in we were proudly told about the \""free internet\""...We were told how easy it was to access it.  What we weren't told was that they charge a $28 a day resort fee.  I am certainly not a resort-fee virgin, but I have never encountered one before that was more than $15 per day.  Usually the purpose of the fee is to cover internet.  Well, for that kind of money, I would expect it to work like a charm and it did not.  That being said, we weren't exactly hanging around the room bemoaning our lack of internet access.  Of course we were out and about...but it's kinda the principle of the thing, ya know? How about just charging $28 more per night up front?  \n\n  That and I'm not a fan of the casino.  Blackjack...not Bellagio level.  Plus this is the only casino we've EVER been in where a slot machine jammed.  Husband was playing and it totally stuck.  It took forever before we could find help to get it unstuck.  Here we were at 4:00 or so on a Monday afternoon and the guy who helped us indicated that the machine was \""full\"".  That they cleared it out in the middle of the night.  Well, by golly that is one machine you don't want to play if it never gives up anything, huh?\n\n   One last minor reason for less than five stars was checking out.  We couldn't get it to work on our tv.  Luckily they weren't too busy at the front desk, but the gal we had checking us out was not very friendly. Left a last not-so-great goodbye.\n\n   All-in-all however, we would go back in a heartbeat.  Where else in this country (world) can you stay in a hotel of this caliber for this kind of money?  sigh, love Vegas!"
1,They have so much to offer.  The food and wine list are perfect for the budget.  They offer live entertainment and Brunch too!
0,"I m writing this review for the gilbert rd/ baseline location but it seems the complaints are similar from location to location\nTheir food is good but god help you if you go there when its busy like we did on friday night 10/16/14\nYou don't get a single second to decide what you want before they sling it in your aluminum dish. Then they slide 4-5 of the same looking burrito under the cooker with no ID to the customer. GUESS WHAT?? You get the wrong burrito and they throw your food around like its a jailhouse mess hall. I watched a female employee throw a cup of guac at the cashier who did not catch it.\nIts cafeteria style and when its busy.....its a freaking zoo\n\nSo.... You get the wrong burrito and pay more at the register.  Watch out for extra anything because you'll pay for it.\nEven though we had a free burrito coupon....it was a nuthouse and the employees are slinging so fast that you simply dont have time to decide anything.\nSo you get what you get and with 30 people single file in a long line...who's gonna listen to you??\n\nHey Cafe Rio- time to rethink your assembly line process and instead of upchargng for grilled steak and chicken, just have them be priced as separate burritos on your menu. Grilled meat is a mexican standard??? No???\n\nRight now....Chipolte is my go to burrito for price and service...sorry cafe rio."
1,"This is my fiancee and I's go to bar when we're in Vegas. What really attracts this bar to my fiancee and I is the music. It's like going back to the early MTV days. The drinks are typical for a Vegas bar, about ~$15 for a mixed drink. The drinks are strong and expertly made. They specialize in whiskeys and bourbons, but seem to have everything else that you might like to drink. \n\nOn our last visit, we arrived here right before a private company function, but weren't kicked out once their party started.  It made for some really interesting people watching, especially since it was an older crowd trying to party it up Vegas style like the younger crowd. The live entertainment tried to liven up the crowd, but the crowd just seemed kinda dead. The bartenders are attentive and despite the huge crowd, we never had any issues getting another drink."
1,"I had been hearing about In-N-Out for YEARS now, but as an East Coast girl, I never had the opportunity to try it until my trip to Las Vegas.  We had a view of the restaurant from our hotel room and I was staring that place down until I could finally get off the strip and get some burger deliciousness.\n\nWe went around 2pm and the place was absolutely packed, we waited for about 20 minutes which was fine because it gave me a chance to study the (not so extensive) menu.  I'll admit, I'm actually a fan of places with smaller menus sometimes.  If you stick to making a few items and  you make them really really well, then no need to expand and add subpar food.  Finally, I had a chance to place my order, an animal style cheeseburger, fries and a chocolate shake, in case you were wondering.    It was another 10 minute wait for the food and at this point I was about to ask the people waiting in line next to me if I could steal a few fries, I was so hungry.    I'm really happy to say it was totally worth the wait(both the 30 minutes of waiting in line/waiting for my food to be cooked up and the years of hearing about how I had to try In-N-Out).  The fries were hot and crispy without being over cooked, the burger tasted fresh and juicy and the milkshake was hands down, the best fast food milkshake I've ever had.  The prices were so cheap too! In Vegas, it seems like everything's expensive, but In-N-Out sure wasn't.\n\nLiving in PA, I have access to Five Guys which I still think I prefer over In-N-Out a little bit(although Five Guys is definitely pricier), but if you're on the West Coast, forget the McDonalds and Burger King and get over to In-N-Out for some cheap and yummy food."
1,"I love the atmosphere in o'leary's. It's a little tiny family owned cafe where everyone knows your name by the time you leave. The place is very intimate, VERY pittsburgh, and the food is great."
0,"Food is good and the free wine and beer are a big plus.  Having said that, it's not what it used to be and the line is RIDICULOUS!   I got in line at 1:40 this afternoon and 50 minutes later, I've made it about halfway through.  I know the place is not full, I looked.  This same scenario happened two weeks ago, as well, but I thought I'd give in one more try.  As an M card carrying local, not cool.  Safe to say I won't be doing this again anytime soon."
0,"Came in at 12;30pm for a lunch. Brought my wife and daughter. We were the only people in this restaurant. We we seated and handed menus. The lunch menu was limited, but I finally settled on the wood fired sausage and goat cheese pizza. The mezzo. My wife had the chicken parm. My daughter wanted fettuccine alfredo, but it wasn't on the menu. I asked if the chef could make that. The server went to ask and informed us that yes they could. Very nice I thought. I really enjoyed the waitress, because she was attentive to us, and when I pointed out that 2 of our forks were dirty before we even used them she had us clean ones asap. Our food arrives and my pizza was a big letdown. I do not know how that could of been a wood fired pizza. It was tasteless, and could of been a frozen pizza. My daughters fettuccine alfredo tasted like milk.. Warm milk on fettuccine. Not good. I only ate one piece of the pizza. My wife's chicken parm was surprisingly good with no complaints. I really cannot ever see myself ever coming back. Not worth my hard earned money when there are so many different better options out there."
1,Always have a great experience here.  Sometimes I have more than one massage to use so I'll take advantage of a two hour and/or a facial.  Well-trained staff with a clean environment.  It's so close to home and convenient.
0,"\""Very rude waitress. Under staffed. One blue moon was $9.50 after tax. I waited 18 minutes before I was served. They make you pay and tip immediately. The waitress rolled her eyes at me and said, \""Really?\"" when I tipped her 10%...when she deserved no tip. AVOID!!!\"""
0,"Stopped by here for lunch with some coworkers. It was a slow afternoon and we decided to sit outside (nobody out there). The patio is spacious and well maintained, with an bar open to the inside of the restaurant. Service was a bit slow, especially bringing the food out. Some of the dishes were clearly sitting out for a while (read cold food). I had an apple salad with goat cheese, figs, and a delicious dressing. It was really good, but too small even for a lunch portion. I might give it one more try, but my first go around was a fail."
0,"As an informative museum, this is only meh.\nAs a fun way to spend a few hours in Vegas, this is five stars.\nSo, figure out what you want of your day and you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe museum has a nice amalgamation of things, but they aren't necessarily curated in a way that helps explain context. (i.e. why is a 21st century book on Atomic Cocktails mixed in with all the 1950-s era materials? Why is there a stuffed mountain lion atop one of the the fake rocks? I'm sure there is a reason - help me understand.)\n\nOthers have indicated that the museum is slightly biased. I would say that the museum is tremendously biased. And, that's ok provided you keep that in mind. They do not even try to hide the difficulties of waging war with nuclear weapons, but, there is minimal discussion of atomic waste or decisions over which areas of the world (outside of Nevada) were selected and why for testing. An example of propaganda? In one location, a giant bore bit is displayed with a sign that suggests that, were it not for underground testing, we would not have had the equipment needed to rescue the Chilean miners.\n\nThe Area 51 exhibit is ridiculous, but I would totally go through it again\n\nIf you read all the signage, it will take you several hours to work through the museum. And, a warning that the movie has VERY bright lights, sound, and even wind. It scared the crap out of me.\n\nI had a blast (no pun intended) and would recommend it to anyone interested in seeing unusual sites. But, as a museum with the Smithsonian name on it, it has some deficits as an educational facility."
0,"This place used to be an awesome place to hangout 5 years ago, but after many construction changing and now it become unattrative for more customers to come...."
1,"Oh Rao's I am so happy we met. This is good, solid Italian food. Yes the menu is limited but what they do, they do well. Service was good, attentive without being disruptive.  Special faves, the ravioli purses and the Veal Parm."
1,"I like Mckoys..........WAY better than Mac's!!\n\nThe wings are great nice smoked flavor on them and a good variety of sauces to choose from, not just your basic buffalo.\n\nRibs were Enormous!!! I had a 1/2 rack and they too had a great smoked flavor. I had a salad which was surprisingly good and the Mac N Cheese as the waitress put it \""Crack N Cheese\""...wasn't as good as the first time i had it, but still good!! \n\nServer was ok, not looking for a 5 star dining experience but still like it as another option for barbecue!!"
0,"I've been twice now and have been let down both times. The burgers are not juicy (you can watch the cooks press down the burgers on the grill) and I don't think they could pull off medium rare to save their lives, both times ended up with medium well\nWill NOT give a 3rd chance"
1,"I love the Phoenix zoo. So I grew up in south Phoenix and this was our go to field trip in elementary school. \n\nSeriously, we went every year. \n\nBut I was ok with that because I loved it. I've enjoyed picnics (the way too go, the food is not that great and it's expensive), birthday parties, and scavenger hunts here. I even saw a wedding here once. On a nice day it makes for a great walk. Too bad they didn't have the water park type area when I was a kid. It looks so refreshing to splash in during the summer when the afternoons can be unbearable. Trust me, I've thought about shoving a kid or too out of the way just to enjoy a sprinkle.  \n\nIt's also nice to come here in December when it's a little chilly and grab a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy Zoo Lights."
1,"On Thursdays, it's also a happening spot. \n\nDJ's Mara and Brazilia take the decks upstairs and spin a mix of electro, funk, old school rap, and whatever. Mara is a short, cute, hispanic lesbian who has been rocking the decks in Phoenix since her days as a rave DJ in the early 90's. Brazilia is a tall, gorgeous Brazilian woman who knows how to rock a party and play to the crowd like few DJ's I've ever seen. Local electronic musicians often show up with their laptops and MIDI gear to perform mind-blowing, live, improvisational performances. It's much less crowded than Saturdays, but it brings an interesting crowd. You can actually have a conversation, unlike on Saturdays which is mostly wall to wall dancing people. Not that that's a bad thing. \n\nDownstairs is hip-hop, which attracts a hypersexual, young ASU crowd. It's usually super crowded, and they're all grinding on each other with abandon before heading back to the dorms and contracting genital warts or who knows what."
0,Terrible service... We tried to have a nice gathering and it took the lady over 25 minutes to make an espresso!! You would expect a lot more from the Ritz! So bummed
0,"I cannot believe this place charges for valet. I come to Vegas almost every other month for business and/or pleasure and have never paid a nickel in my life for parking in vegas. Plus, after paying that steep $ just for parking, they never charged our Tesla after we made the long trek from Orange County. We rolled into town with 50 miles left on our battery and told valet to please charge the car. They promised to do so, but almost 3 hours later, I check on my car with my app and find out they never touched it, let alone charge it. Then, I wasn't comfortable driving out around town to dinner and whatever because of the low battery. \n\nOther than valet problems, decor is new, rooms redone cosmetically, and that's about it. I don't know if I would bother staying here again in the future when there are so many other better options in Vegas."
0,"My bf and love Guy so we finally got the chance to try his food here in Vegas. Ambience was western, casual, and relaxing. We sat at the bar since there were seats opened. We ordered a drink Java Guava, Cajun Sandwich, and Flavortown Sandwich. The only thing we liked was my drink. We were high in sodium because the sandwiches were extremely salty so we couldn't finish them. So disappointed, but who knows the other choices might be less salty, even the couple right next to us experienced the same thing. Service was good though."
1,First-timer here this week and the experience was good. They were able to get me in on very short notice and I really enjoyed the 90-minute massage. \n\nMy biggest complaint is they try to up-sell you quite a bit. I was not interested in buying a package but boy they tried hard to sell me one! They also up-sold me on the 90 minute massage (I was originally booked for 60 minutes) but it turned out I was glad for the extra time.
1,"This was my first visit.  So, I went with a #37 combination plate.  It had a taco, enchilada and a tamale.  All was very good but the tamale was dry (?) as it had already been unwrapped and had a chance to dry out before I received my meal.  The counter help was real nice.\n\nThe meals are served on black plastic plates.  The plastic utensils are long handled.  They offer Coke products and tea.  They were out of Mr Pibb during my visit.\n\nIt was good enough that I will stop back in.  And I would recommend the place to others."
1,"I'm not sure what else can be said about MIM that had not already been said by others. If you're into music you have to come by if you're in the Phx area. It is $18 for adults, but they give this really cool audio guide to use while there which helps a lot. The museum itself is very large and ultra modern. Make sure and visit the artist gallery on the first floor. Also jam with others in the Experience Gallery too."
1,"This place is naturally popular because of the trendy health craze nowadays. But Nekter is right up there in my opinion! I come here for the acai bowls and theirs is definitely one of my favorites in the valley! It is a huge portion, great taste, just the right amount of sweet/tart and they are generous with the fruit & granola toppings. One bowl is good for 2 to share if having it for a healthy dessert which is what my bf and I usually do. When we are craving smoothies, this is also one of our go-to places. This is also where I tried my first pitaya bowl and it was excellent! More tart than the acai bowl but still sweet and filling. The location is nice and convenient, right in the heart of Ahwatukee. Parking is limited though being next to other restaurants. I have never been here during peak hours so I have never experienced a long wait for my order."
0,"This airport is such a civil engineering nightmare!\n\n My latest single point of failure was arriving on Delta and having the trains not working.\nThe contingency play was to run one train. Not bad, but didn't service the 2500 or so people who all tried to jam into it. The escalators never work---methinks they are decorative----like a bad sculpture. \n\nRental car return--problematic as the buses have trouble getting through traffic to the airport\nTSA-very slow in this airport\nCabs--cab line in Vegas can be a real zoo. Coming back to the airport via cab can also be a mess as the front of the airport is designed to breed perpetual congestion.\nFood--limited choices\n\nFor a city which only exists because of tourism, it would be wise for the LV Airport commissioners to study Orlando and implement modern airport design 101."
0,"Very bad! \nNow people that know me, KNOW that I LOVE MY MEAT! I am very familiar with Brazilian Churrascaria's. I went there with a group of 8 people on Friday 8/22. Four people in my group had never been to a place like this and I was sharing my past experiences and what  might to expect.  \n\nIT WAS NOTHING LIKE I EXPLAINED to my friends...\nWe got there and were seated. We were at a round table  that was directly behind the hostess table and it was in the corner.  There was a cement banister  making it hard for two people to be comfortable and get in and out.\n\nThe waiter came by and was very pushy about getting the unlimited drinks. Three of us ordered the unlimited and then we were told about the drink restrictions. Whatever we went with it. \n\nHe didn't really explain about the process to the new people that were with us. I had asked him to explain and let them know the process.  After the waiter being inconvenienced to explain the process, we were able to get up and go to the salad bar. Mind you, the banister is there and just annoying.  I will say that the sweet & Sour Chicken was very good at the salad bar. \n\nFor the next 45 minutes the only meats that were brought around was the Pork Loin, which was very good and moist and flavored well.  The next was the House meat Picanha, which was very bland and no flavor.  The following was the Lamb, I just don't do Lamb. The last server had the pineapple! Besides the Sweet & Sour Chicken the pineapple was very good.  That is all that came around. Those same ones kept rotating for 45 minutes.  I finally went up to talk to the manager and asked how many meats are in rotation. She told me there are 14.  I let her know the situation and she said she will look into it.\n\nSoon after that a female server came directly at me and again had the Lamb, I said No thank you, the same server came out and then had the picanha and I didn't like it the first 4 times so I said no.  She then said . Well, What meats do you want? I was like WHOA! excuse me, She again said which meats do I want. I said I do not know all the meats you have and then she, in a sarcastic latina voice started to RAMBLE and RAMBLE the meat list.  I had to ask her to stop and I could not understand her ramblings and again she said the names and faster. I then said, Why are you just asking me? There are 7 other people at this table but we all have only chosen from 4 different items.  She was irritated and I was too.  Then the Male bald server came directly to me again and he brought the Lamb.  REALLY? I said to him, Is that al they have back there because we had not had any Sausage, Chicken, Tri Tip,  other meats.  I was really disappointed that apparently the manager pointed me out and I felt these  servers were overdoing it and still not bringing anything other than the ones we already had.\n\nEventually they brought out the sausage and chicken, but by this time I was REALLY irritated and they never brought all 14 choices. SMH...I will not be going back to this place."
0,"Beware!  After encouraging customers to order on line with a discount, that discount was discontinued.  The owner also decided (for reasons the manager could not remember when I asked) to charge $1.50 for ordering on line AND charge an additional 3% for using a credit card (like you have a choice).  So on top of the already close to highest prices in town for frequently overcooked pizza, management is now also trying to stick it to its loyal customers with new charges hidden in the fine print.  Think twice before doing business with these folks, and watch your wallet."
0,Just tried to get breakfast and walked out. We walked in to no one even saying hello but 2 girls talking to each other. Waited 3 awkward minutes for them to finally say something and was finally say outside. Then sat for 30 minutes without anyone even saying hi or getting us a drink. Walked out and never coming back! You guys suck!
0,"Paid for Lunch is a perk that we have at work and we all decide on a place to eat for that day and we order. Well we have placed an order a few times with Sofias Pizza, The first time we ordered it was okay, but we decided to try it again...They take your order and get it to relatively fast but the quality of the food is not there. The pizza was border line the first time and we tried it again and it was a Grease Bucket... You know that your pizza is a little too Greasy when you eat it and all you can taste after is Grease."
0,"Why is this shop so expensive? I don't get it. Well I do. They are in a train station and hope you will wander in for your paper/magazine and decide you need something to eat or drink. Well don't do it! Everything is practically double the price it would normally be, a Mars bar is almost a pound! Buy your paper/magazine/book then wander over to Boots and get a meal deal. Or go to Marks and Spencers Food Hall, even that will be cheaper than this shop!"
0,Place sucks they refused to take back a jack stand that I  bought from them because I didn't have a receipt. Spoke to the manager and was told the same thing. So I went to the one on Decatur and they took it back. I guess I won't be shopping at the rainbow location anymore!!!
1,"Amateurs de bonnes bi\u00e8res, vous allez ca-po-ter.

Ils n'h\u00e9sitent pas \u00e0 nous verser quelques gorg\u00e9es pour nous faire go\u00fbter, pour qu'on soit absolument satisfait de notre choix. \n\nEt satisfaite, je le suis \u00e0 chaque fois! J'essaie de varier un peu les bi\u00e8res que je prends l\u00e0-bas (et en plus la s\u00e9lection change constamment), mais je dois avouer que je finis souvent par retomber sur ma bonne vieille IPA de Dunham ou du Trou du Diable.

1,"If you are looking for good Indian food in Vegas that is not pretentious, this is definitely a great bet.  The chicken tikka and nan are fantastic.  I haven't had a chance to try anything else yet but I will definitely be coming back and will update my review."
1,"Best Indian I have had so far in Pittsburgh.  Food is well spiced, and the saag is probably the best I have ever had.  Naan left a little bit to be desired.\n\nService is a bit sloppy, slow, easily flustered but friendly nonetheless.  They got my order wrong and didn't offer to fix it... probably because I was happy with what they sent out and had already eaten half of it :-)\n\nAll in all, I will go back."
1,Completely agree with Seth Y. on the smell issue. Other than that the green fees are reasonable as long as you don't mind golfing in the afternoon. Everything is very organized and well marked and the course is fun and challenging for players of all skill levels. I can't wait to go back and actually get to finish 18. Slow groups should be forced off the course! Grr
0,"I would not recommend anyone going to Nachos unless it is for something very simple like putting in a new battery. The mechanics for the most part do not speak English. I have no issue with that except they are apparently shade tree mechanics. My car was towed there by the Auto Club who said even though he wasn't on the AAA approved list, he was good. This must have been his cousin ! He repaired a transmission seal on my car which became a disaster. Once I made it home on limp mode since he ruined a speed sensor in my car, the mechanic took photos of the lines they had cut in half and then re did with blue masking tape. I still have the photos. Don't go there for major work. It will be done by guys who are not true mechanics and do not even know that you do not cut wires. It was sloppy work and my transmission never worked right again until hundreds of dollars more were spent to repair the damage done. I was taken advantage of since I was a tourist."
1,The prices here are cheap... And I mean extremely cheap! Our dinner was around $20 for two including tax and tip. The food itself was disappointing based on the reviews. The gyro meat seemed processed or lower quality but still pretty good. Just more state fair gyro than authentic gyro. The greek salad was decent quality. The fries were awesome! Overall extremely great value for the price and worth a stop for a cheap eat. Just don't expect the best most authentic greek you've ever had. Excellent attentive friendly service as well!!
0,I got their lunch special and came out to be a little over $6 for an one item combo. Tell you the truth it wasn't worth it. I ordered 4 combos anc asked for some hot sauce abd they only gave me one hot suace. Can you say stingy? I won't be coming back for more. I guess back to Panda Express.
0,"Awfull, chicken undercooked, bartender a got order messed up, there were 6 people in the place total, awful experience"
1,I grab a slice here whenever I'm up for a basic east-coast style pizza. It's a small place-- it's good for take out or for a quick dinner.
0,"Doesn't even come close to Chipotle. Funny thing is, I LOVED Q'doba so much when I lived in California! The service was always excellent and the food tasted fresh. Here in Vegas, my Q'doba experiences have never impressed me...this Rainbow location in particular.\n\nThey're never that busy when I've been but their service always seems impatient and sub-par. I ordered the naked vegetarian burrito which includes guacamole. Sadly, the veggies aren't included (lame...especially since it's a VEGETARIAN entre) so beware because they'll sometimes offer you the vegetables without telling you about the extra cost.\n\nThey also have quite a lot of trouble processing coupons or certificates. One lady went so far as to have my husband email her his certificate from his phone because she insisted on her need to have a paper copy in hand (other locations don't seem to have this problem).\n\nWhether we make it through smoothly or not, they never really seem all that nice and while I don't need to be catered to and coddled, it is nice if someone at least acknowledges you when you're addressing them or completing your transaction."
0,Waste of time and money. My wheels are still dirty. Inside was barely wiped down and can tell no cleaner was used just a dry towel that left lint EVERYWHERE. I should've known a good job couldn't have been done in the 6 minutes I was there.
1,"\""Terroir\"" is a French term that is used most frequently to describe the characteristics of a group of vineyards in a given region.\n\nIn a more literal sense it means \""a sense of place\""...it's more about a mood and environment... it's almost purely subjective and qualitative of the feeling you get when you are in the right place and everything about that place is as it should be:)\n\nI like that appellation for the sweet little wine bar on Scottsdale Rd:)\n\nIf you've never quite felt at home in a wine bar, this might be the place for you to find your \""terroir\"":)\n\nTerroir Wine Pub has \""savoir-faire\"" ...a certain je ne sais quoi...both comfortable and welcoming that feels right to me:) \n\nTerroir is not swank...it's not \""Euro\"", it's eclectic as hell, from the art on the walls to the \""open mike\"" nights\n\nI am not a wine connoisseur (or \""oenophile\"", for those of you counting on me to overtax both my high school French and my vocabulary skills:), but I can always find something that I like to drink at Terroir, along with small plates (fromage, olives and nuts, saumon and bruschetta) and some interesting conversation.\n\nDecent wine selections and decent prices:)\n\nI've also found talent at Terroir!\n\nI had no idea that there are so many talented people around!\n\nThe Beautiful Carin and I have been to a couple of Open Mike nights here and we went to special event a few nights ago (showcasing the extremely talented Sarah Jolly...WOW, can this girl sing a song!!:-)\n\nSarah was terrific!

1,"There's a reason Blackwells has so many reviews. It really is a great bookshop. A modest chain store it may be, but you will forget that with its excellent quality of service.\n\nThis Blackwells in particular is stocked well with academic books geared toward the nearby University campus. In fact Blackwells is the first port of call for arts and humanities students stocking up on their course textbooks (if they're buying them first hand anyway). But beyond this they still offer a great range within each genres. Take philosophy. yes they offer some of the pop and pulp philosophy like Waterstones and other chains, but they also stock some really stimulating, acadademic books and new publications outwith the philosophy department's reading lists. This makes browsing these sections far more intereting.\n\nOf course they don't only offer academic books, being a commercial high street book shop and you can still expect everything on the top 100 book charts, all your Twilights and what nots. Blackwells also has a good children's section and a modest selection of stationery. As I've mentioned in a previous review, I also enjoy the guilty pleasure of sitting in the Costa cafe attached, and browsing through books I've picked up.\n\nBooks are a little pricey, but Blackwells isn't any more expensive than Waterstones or whoever. It is of course cheaper to buy online.\n\nOverall an excellent bookshop with a better selection than most high street retailers."
0,$45 for two frozen machine margaritas and two shots of Sammy Hagar's shit tequila.  They print on receipt suggested tip of $12.  This place stunk like they had sewer issues behind the bar.  It left such a bad taste in my mouth that I will flip the station next time I hear a Sammy Hagar song.
0,"Went to this restaurant because my brother saw a lot of \""Recession Special\"" ads on billboards and since he was craving for Indian food, we ended up going there for his birthday brunch.  Presentation was good, portions were on the \""smaller\"" side but then again, majority of Indian food comes that size!  We had the Lamb Kurma, Tandori Chicken, and several folks in my party had the \""all-you-can-eat\"".  The place was PACKED for a Saturday afternoon -- and there was only 1 poor waiter running around pouring water, taking orders, cleaning tables,... and he was probably the cook too 'cause we waited and waited and waited for our food.  Not being too \""graphic\"", hours after brunch, I wasn't feeling too great.  Later that day when I told my brother, he said, \""Oh,... I forgot to tell you that last week when we tried to come for lunch, the Health Department shut it down due to some \""pipes issues\"", supposedly.\""  Nice....  bro!!!  Happy *@$#(*@(*#( Bday!  :-/"
1,"SUMMARY: I think the Flamingo is great value for the money and if you're expecting a 3 or 3.5 star hotel with a younger crowd and a lively atmosphere at night I'd definitely consider the Flamingo with one of their GO rooms.\n\nThe Flamingo has a great location in the centre of the strip. There is currently some construction on one side as they have tore down O'Sheas and are working around the Imperial Palace however my room did not face this side so I don't know if the noise affects the guest rooms.\nWhen we arrived the valet parking stated it was already full for the day and it was only about 1:30pm. We came by cab so I'm unsure whether or not there was a self parking option however it's something to keep in mind.\nUpon check-in there was a massive lineup and we proceeded to \""Self Check In\"" through their kiosks where we then discovered there was a line for all Total Rewards members (not just Platinum or whatever higher levels there are). This was something I haven't seen at other hotels so definitely bring your Total Rewards card and use this check-in/check-out line. This would definitely be a drawback from the Platinum/higher level members because they'll have to wait in line with the Gold-tier members.\nWe booked a GO room and my friend booked a FAB room. The GO room was completely renovated with a separate shower/tub, TV in the bathroom, Denon sound system, large flat screen TV in the bedroom, motorized curtains, etc. The FAB room was renovated EXCEPT for the washroom. It had some sort of faux wood floors. The room was nice but we all agreed the GO room was better (and it was less than the FAB room).\nThe casino is nice, clean and lively at night, filled with mostly young people at night. The downside is that it is busy at night if you want to play table games or one of the popular slot machines.\nWe found little to no noise in our GO room at night and couldn't hear any of our neighbours. Our AC kept the room nice and cool and functioned great. The room service appears to come rather early in the morning (before 9:00am), however we put out the \""do not disturb\"" tag and were left alone.\n\nOverall I think the Flamingo is great value for the money. It's not a five star luxury resort and does not try to be, so don't book a room/suite there and expect it to be like theHotel. I'm not sure I would go for a Deluxe room because the cost to get a GO room is only a little more and seeing some of the dated parts of the hotel I can only imagine how dated those rooms are. I would stay at the Flamingo again in a GO room because of it's location and price, however if you're looking for a more relaxing/quiet experience in your vacation you might want to look towards a different casino with a more mature crowd. If you're expecting a 3 or 3.5 star hotel with a younger crowd and a lively atmosphere at night I'd definitely consider the Flamingo with one of their GO rooms."
0,"Everyone raves about strip clubs in Vegas, but honestly, I was bored. It's not like I'm a topless bar connoisseur, but I'm pretty sure that my reaction wasn't supposed to involve boredom. \n\nA stripper here told me that what she really wanted to do was be a teacher. I hope she got her teaching credentials!"
0,"CAUTION!!!!!!\nThis dining experience was literally the worst I have ever had in my life, and I'm including all (fast food, grocery store delis, taco carts in Rocky Point...) Our server was Jerome and he was the most rude, unfriendly, unknowledgeable server I have had. He couldn't answer any questions about the menu, he didn't make any eye contact, and dunring our 2 HOUR dining experience (not by choice, because they were that slow with a whopping 2 full tables) we only saw him like three times. It took almost a half hour to get our appetizer, we had no silverware or napkins the entire time and had to eat it with our fingers and asked for napkins several times and ended up unsing the tablecloth when Jerome failed to bring any. Our food took forever and was incorrect but after the wait we sucked it up and ate it anyways. It was mediocre, putting it kindly. Our drinks were only refilled when we requested and it was done by the busser because even he couldn't find our server. We had to hunt our server down 30 minutes after we were finished eating to ask him to bring the check. He was found in the bar hanging out with friends and when I asked the bartender the please get him, the bartender scoffed at me and said he would be over when he was ready. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! When he finally brought the check, it was incorrect and he had to fix it, 4 TIMES! It was a party of 4 eating and it was only two appetizers, a salad, and two entrees. How hard could it be?!!! The caption on the website reads \""If you're looking for a welcoming atmosphere, great customer service, great food...\"" DO NOT BE MISLEAD, THEY LIE!"
1,"I've become a regular here...I love how fresh everything tastes. My usual is a berry blast smoothie, Roasted garlic hummus with extra pita bread and a prima grilled cheese without tomatoes as I'm picky about how my tomatoes are cut \n\nThis place had met my expectations repeatedly, a definite go to."
1,"First time, had Lemon Butter Sauce over Angel Hair Pasta. Toppings: red roasted peppers and mushrooms... then made critical mistake of paying $4 extra for 4 shrimp. The shrimp were sooo over cooked they cooked have bounced to the ceiling! (My daughters were the same way) Omit the shrimp and the Pasta and the Sauce were Fabulous!!  Split a Cannoli (first time), it was good. Not huge fan. Service was great however we ate an Early dinner so was not busy yet. She was very friendly. By the end of our dinner it was starting to get busy. Service slacked a little. Waited 15 mins. to come back and take check,  had to flag someone down to come take so we could pay and leave. \nAll in all I would go back, many other tempting items on the menu!"
0,"Yikes!  This is an accident waiting to happen.  It was complete chaos.  \nThe trainer did no intake and did nothing to find out anything about me or my partner.  If he read the intake (which is measly), he would have known my partner shouldn't have lifted over his head.  I also told him my resting heart rate was extremely low, so the regular \""orange theory\"" burn of an average heart rate reading wouldn't apply.  There is no customization for an individual, you are just one of the cattle being put through the same moves as everyone else.  I guess if you've been there a while, you've grown accustomed to setting your own pace, but three of us were new and in completely different conditions.  I was extremely concerned for the third person who was a young girl with no knowledge of form or core stability.  \nMy advice - run away!"
0,"I have been going to this nail salon for over a year (at over $1000) despite the fact that they take 2 hours to do my nails, charge me a fortune (almost double most salons) and do a horrible job. After switching to a different nail salon, I returned to this salon to get my eyebrows waxed.  Holly, grabbed my hand on one visit and then started speaking in Vietnamese to John and the other employees referencing my nails.  Holly and John have since been very rude to me on the phone and when I come in.  They act like they are in high school and are obviously and overly friendly with the other customers and then pretend they don't even know who I am when I come in.  Holly did my eyebrows (08/27/2014), and instead of putting an oil to remove excess hot wax (which is what she normally does), she pulled and rubbed my face and eyebrow hairs with a cloth to get the excess wax off and made my entire eye area sore and red (more than the norm).  She left hot wax on my eyebrows which clumped together and hardened when I got to my car.  She didn't warn me when she started to trim my eyebrows - she almost cut my lashes or could have poked my eye with those scissors.  She clipped too much on one eye and not enough on the other.  She used to do a good job (which is why I still came to her for my eyebrows), but once she figured out I was going to a different salon for my nails, she and John treat me horribly.  We are paying customers and we have every right to go to any or all the nail salons in the Valley!  I have reported her and John to the AZ State Board of Cosmetology, BBB and the PeopleClaim Agency.  For your safety, if you go somewhere else in addition to their salon, wear your protective gear, they will seek revenge and purposefully hurt you!"
1,"I call CPK, safe adventure.  It's great when you have to go somewhere with a large group, and you don't want to cave into a totally non-descript chain.  Everyone can find something on the menu that they can tolerate, and I actually think the pizzas are quite good.  The prices are average, and the service is typically friendly.  The next time you have a business meeting or large group to accomodate, I recommend it."
0,"it has one star, because its required before i can tell you how HORRIBLE this location is.\nOH MY GOD!\nits like they went to fremont and hired any possible preson who was desperate for a job. a couple of the associates smelled, thats right SMELLED. like body odor. seriously? take a shower, youre in customer service let alone the FOOD BUSINESS! the kid at the register seemed as if he just got back from smoking a blunt in the back and although my order was repeated back correctly, it was received INCORRECTLY!\nwhen i went back to get them to do it right, it took 5 minutes before i had to yell to the back to get someones attention. then the person that ended up fixing what was wrong fixed it with no gloves. god knows what she was doing before considering all staff disappeared to the back. the people behind us waiting for food even said they had terrible customer service. at one point i got so tired of waiting i climbed over the counter for ketchup. on top of all that, when my boyfriend got his food, it looked like the person who made the sandwich got hungry and gouged a piece of chicken right out of the center THEN proceeded to put it on the bun. food looked old, overcooked, dry, disgusting! \ni ended up handing everything back and demanding a refund.\nabsolutely ridiculous staff!\nstart hiring people with educations and people that show respect to those around them by BATHING. this place needs to be start over from scratch. from building to employees.\nworst KFC, ever!"

Their are PLENTY of options in Charlotte and I would suggest wandering off the beaten path and avoid the bright lights that sucked us in.  \n\nWhen you charge 30 dollars for a \""pitcher\"" of sangria, atleast have pitchers that dont make the waiter pour half of it onto the floor.  \n\nJust no"

Yay! I get lunch tomorrow!  \n\nBrandon was our server. I totally felt catered too. Not cheap, but well,worth it \n\nLoved the atmosphere and the funny owner. He wasn't bad at all. Relax people, it takes all kinds to spin this great  world. He was funny and sccommodating."
1,"Supreme quality, but extreme pricing. A great place for lunch, happy hour, or to make a good impression. \n\nLove the ambiance, ideal for a date, business meeting, or any sort of good impression, and the staff is top notch too.\n\nThe sushi, especially sashimi, is high grade. Amazingly fresh stuff, and the selection is varied with different types. For a truly special occasion try the lobster dynamite-- it might have been one of the best seafood dishes I have ever tasted. \n\nThe cocktail menu is impressive, but the martinis can be a bit strong. \n\nDinner pricing is high, but nothing unusual for the marketplace, and portions are small, but like I said before you're paying for the quality and atmosphere."
1,Probably this is the best Korean restaurant around Phoenix area. Personally i think it is better than Kodori. At least the waiter/waitress are bit nicer :). The qualify of the food is good but the price is a bit high.
1,"another meal with my daughter and her friend....since her friend's never been to vegas - gotta hit a nostaligic / landmark place ...it was breakfast time ....peppermill !!!\nof course we started with the fruit plate ( the fruit was very good - needed more pineapple !!  more marshmallow for the banana bread !! )\ndaughter had hamsteak, her friend had a pancake/egg/sausage combo, i had hash w/ basted eggs....as always - large portions - we left with more than 1/2 the food ( ate it on the drive home !! ) my only minor dings - the hash tasted like canned hash.  the service slow even though the place was not busy...but the server was very, very nice !\n\nyou gotta show this place some love !!!"

0,"Lets just say that I am mirroring other reviews, but what the hell!!\n\nFor starters, my wife and I are frequent travelers to Vegas and have stayed in a multitude of rooms/suites. This has to be one of the oddest rooms that we have ever staying in. First of all, No Room Bar.... What, it's Vegas. 2nd, there was the oddly place television, I know that we don't go to Vegas for the room, but with the bed facing one way and the TV on the opposite right wall, thanks for the neck ache. Room was pretty out dated and furniture needs a little work. The shower had almost \""zero\"" pressure as well as the room always felt dirty. Here's the odd one, only (2) lamps worked in the room and one had to be turned off by using towel to unscrew the lightbulb...WTF???? \n\nThe Casino is fun, staff is friendly and actually can have a conversation, but the Casino is Small in compared to others. I really don't understand the layout of the restaurants as they seem to be hidden around corners. You'll be walking along and all of a sudden... up pops a restaurant.... Didn't partake in any of their restaurants as they seem wildly out of the way and menu's were not that appealing.\n\nI would again like to say that the Staff was excellent and somewhat helpful, but the rooms were a complete disaster. I also agree with the earlier post on the $25 a day fee for one item use of the wifi and gym use... Very odd... We won't stay again, but we will always stay at the sister casino. Caesars!!!!\n\nOne final thought... Parents, take your kids to Disney, NOT VEGAS... So annoying seeing all the children either hanging out on the sides waiting for mom and dad to drop their college fund or getting run into by a stroller...Really, a stroller!!!!"
0,Not a great value. The sushi is ok. Not made to order. Other dishes are swimming in manufactured sauces. I find the wait staff to relaxed. Not eager to explain the tablet menu with a smile. Acted like they did me a favour when they did not charge me full price for my 2 year daughter for eating 2 bites of a popcorn chicken dish. Ok if your staving and plan on eating a lot. Food is served fast. Not a place if your looking to try a variety of memorable dishes or sushis.
1,Watched this show a few years ago. Great seating arrangement and a very entertaining show. Even if you know nothing about the Beatles!

Service, food, atmosphere, it's all good here everyday of the week. \n*weekends are busy but worth the wait if you have the time *"
0,"2 stars. Why? The breakfast here is no better than most 24 hour cafes in Vegas hotels. However, they do charge a lot more! Too bad, because the service was pretty friendly, and the chicken apple sausage was decent. The eggs and potatoes were just okay, and I've had much better tasting orange juice. Why is this review kinda blah? Because the food was kinda blah. Much better options in Vegas. Use Yelp to find them!!!"
1,"I needed a water line added to my kitchen in order to utilize the water and ice dispensers on my refrigerator.  The first plumbing company quoted me a price of over $400. George (Cypress Street Plumbing) did the job for half the price and did it not only very well, but in a timely manner. I was so impressed by his work and fair price that I've had him complete two more plumbing jobs in my house and have a fourth one planned for the fall. \n\nCypress Street Plumbing's service was efficient, affordable, cleanly managed, and completed with trust.

1,"Thank you God for hearing my prayers. Finally a truly fabulous isakaya in Montreal! \n\nTruly a great place to share delicious authentic Japanese food while downing sake bombs between dishes amongst friends. Decor is simple and trendy. I just wished the music was less loud as it'd be cool to hear the staff greet and thank you in Japanese when you enter/leave the restaurant like they usually do for this type of establishment.\n\nIn my own opinion, Imakade kicks Kazu's butt. I am just worried about its location. Imadake is more for the younger crowd, not the stuffy Westmount crowd that would expect overpriced sushi.\n\nPlease encourage the owners and run to this restaurant! :P"

0,"I can't believe I returned to this place so many times over the years, my stupidity! I have been treated so rudely so many times. Today was the final straw. I sat for about 15 min at the nail station the guy came over and started filing of my gel polish he then asked if I had acrylic which I had told them I needed a fill when I walked in.  He then got up and walked away without saying anything. I could see him out back smoking and talking on the phone! I'm not sure why he felt the need to walk away with no explanation but I gave him about 5-10 min then couldn't take the lack of customer service anymore! I got up and walked out with two filed off nails! I drove down the street to another place to have them finished. It sucks because they are really good at Nail designs, but I will NEVER go here again!"
0,"Sweet Tomatoes sucks and I'm always confused about how many people are always there. The food is always old, food trays and surrounding areas are filthy, and the selection is so extremely limited and disgusting. Also, the charge is about $13 per adult plus extra for drinks but you can get such a nicer meal elseware at so many wonderful restaurants. I've only been there twice and was regretful both times I went...can't believe I gave it even a second chance. I'll never eat there again."
0,"I could not be more dissatisfied with this dealership. Back in November I had my first run in with the worst BMW rep I've ever met. Matthew Konecek is the absolute worst. WORST. Aside from being argumentative and defensive once called out on mistakes, he isn't attentive or helpful in the least bit. My car notified me regarding my coolant levels, so I take the car in expecting a quick turnaround time, and I was mistaken. I had to call and email multiple times to request an ETA for completion. I received an apology because if I wanted my car to be washed I wouldn't be able to pick it up until the next day. Needless to say, I declined. Next morning comes, and much to my surprise ... Coolant light has the same message displaying on the screen. I pop the hood myself to see that not only was no coolant ever put in my car, but that the cap to the reservoir was never put back on! I call and ask what the issue is and received the \""come back in and we will check it out.\"" I've learned this is code for we don't know what's wrong. Between the time I looked under the hood and returning the car I received a coolant, brake, AND battery notification. I only used the location because of location and certainly do not recommend it. Avoid using this location if at all possible. Matthew is horrible. Garrett is helpful but seeing that I now have a second experience seeming much like the first, helpfulness and niceties can only get a business so far. At some point quality of work needs to play a role. According to Matt, and I quote \""I can assure you that if we made this mistake often, we would certainly go out of business shortly.\"" One could only HOPE!!\n\nToday's experience was due to a recall part that affected the lighting on my car. Every time I brake or turn on my right signal, I receive a lighting malfunction warning. I call early Saturday morning hoping to get in quickly and back out to avoid any traffic tickets and was told the earlier would be Monday at 7am. To avoid rushing, I oblige. Losing an hour of sleep versus paying a tickets seems to be a no brainer. I drop my car off for service at 7am. I arrive, and who runs out the door? Matt, who insisted on helping since the woman who set the appointment didn't provide me with a service reps name. Yay. I tell him the issue, get a loaner and head to work. Around 12:30 I email him to see if he has any idea when I can pick up my vehicle and if there were any other service items that could be handled based on information from the key. He responds with about 30 min, because the the car is being washed. No reference to my other question. Great. Expected. I show up 40 min later, get my vehicle and drive to the exit. As I turn on my right blinker, all of the same notifications come on again. :-| I turn around, park outside the office, turn on the blinker to see that nothing had been fixed. Wonderful. Matt asks what the problem is, then takes the car back. Apparently the recall piece was put in backwards. Those are his words. Not mine. He assures me that everything has been taken care of. I leave again to head all the way back to work. As I'm leaving work, notification regarding brake light appears. Wonderful. Long story short, I go back to the dealership, no managers are available, and I'll be reaching out tomorrow to see what happens. As of right now, I don't think I need to say much more. If I could give no stars, I would."
1,"We had to talk our way in at closing time, and we're glad we did.  As a large group eating family style, we had the chance to try a solid cross section of the menu.  All dishes were excellent, especially the panang curry.  The extensive wine list is a bonus, and the server's recommendation of German riesling was spot-on.  Be a bit careful with the spices - their \""medium\"" is anyone else's \""ultra-hot\"".  So nice to find a hyped restaurant that lives up to the hype."
0,"Two stars, mainly for really attentive service from a friendly staff.\n\nWe ordered boneless honey barbecue wings, a favorite of ours for years from other Native New Yorker locations. They were barely warm, had a really unappealing texture and the sauce was almost flavorless...definitely not what we were used to and have looked forward to over the years."
1,Aqui encontraras un servicio excelente! Very friendly staff and delicious food as well. Food is made to order in plain view which i always enjoy. I tried the carnitas burrito enchilada style and loved it.
0,"Horrible food. My bun was hard and the onion rings tasted like old grease. They forgot my husband's french fries and of course, we didn't realize it until we were down the road. Will not return."
0,"If you use this store as a convenience store you'll like it. If you try to do serious grocery shopping here, not so much. The prices are very high, and the produce is not the best. Think of it as a Super Circle K. Usually only one register open with a line."
1,"We went to Jasmine yesterday for the first time (for lunch) and were blown away!  The restaurant is very clean, the manager so pleasant, and then there's the food.  Mounds and mounds of it.  But quantity does not make for a great buffet.  The quality of the food was extraordinary.  Starting with some of the freshest, prettiest sushi and sashimi I have ever enjoyed.  Flavors just jump out at you.  I never got to eat any of the hot, prepared dishes, but that'll be for next time.  I had several pieces of dim sum which were excellent.  Most especially the sesame cakes and the pork bun.  Then there's the ribs,  Best I've had since leaving New York more than 25 years ago.  If I ate nothing but the ribs, I'd be a very happy camper.  The meat is lean and tender, and has great \""chew\"" to it.  The sauce is more than flavorful.  Oh, YUM!  I never got around to the soups or salads, but, again, that's for next time.  I hope they get lots of patronage and stay around for a long, long time!"
1,"Delicious. I have been looking for a good fish taco place for years. As a Seattle native, I am picky, and getting fish at restaurants in a land locked state always gives me the heebies unless I go to a 5 star restaurant. This little joint opened up right down the road from my house and lemme tell you, so worth it. First off, the gentleman working behind the counter was awesome. Seriously, this guy loves his job and it is so apparent. He asked if it was my first time then went through all the ingredients in their tacos, what makes them special, and recommendations. Didn't even sound canned, just authentic. I ended up getting the fish tacos (two tacos, so massive) and the seafood chowder. Both unbelievably delicious. Coconuts gets this pacific northwesterner's stamp of approval. I am a customer for life, thanks guys for such a great experience."
0,"For my first visit to the Penn Avenue fish market I wasn't really that impressed but I guess since I only had Asiago Bisque, PAFC Salad, and an Avocado roll I don't really have much to go off of. \n\nStaff: They don't really smile and if they are it seems as though their talking amongst themselves. the counter girl is pretty blah zay as well. No personality at all shes more of a \""tell me what you want so I can go do something else\"" \n\nFood: I ordered the Asiago Bisque because they had ran out of the soup I wanted. I shouldn't have gotten the soup. The soup I received with a little package of oyster crackers wasn't hot at all and well soup should be served hot not lukewarm or cold. Plus well it had no flavour. Bland bland bland. \n\nThe salad was alright but seriously crumbled chips on a salad. If I want crumbled chips on my salad I could do that myself.\n\nAvocado Roll. It's avocado with rice rolled. Whatever\n\nMaybe next time Penn Avenue Fish Co."
1,"Being a huge fan of Chicago, and the cuisine it creates, I'm always on the prowl for a good Chicago style pizza or hot dog. I stumbled into Johnny's one day on accident after being disgusted by Z Pizza and I'm glad I did. They do the single best reproduction of the true Chicago hot dog I've had in Phoenix. Perfect bun, dog, relish, onions, sport peppers, celery salt, tomato, and pickles. There is no ketchup to be seen, which scored some big points in my book, until I looked around the corner and saw it was served but with french fries... I guess I can let it slide. Johnny is a nice guy and serves great dogs. Can't beleive nobody has reviewed this place yet..."
0,"WOW .. what terrible service!!! Lazy, incompetent and rude! This is the first time I have ever felt overwhelming necessary to post a complaint.  The server Victoria continued to ignore me after gambling at the same machine for over an hour.  She offered the guests adjacent to me cocktails on four attempts but did not bother to take three more steps in my direction.  After I flagged her down she was obviously annoyed, stating I must not have heard her.  She returned with my drink rolling her eyes whispering under her breath.  Taken back I asked for her supervisor and was approached by a Nani who did not have a business card claiming she just gave her last one away three minutes ago.  I abruptly left.  Unsettled, I called in asking to speak to the food and beverage manager and was forwarded to a Emil Rodgers ---- a table games supervisor? Never bothered to ask me for my name or number giving me an email to his supervisor ---- kmumby@downtowmgrand.com ---- the executive director of tables?!? --- I wasn't playing at a table! Soooooo I called back in again asking for the food and beverage supervisor and was given the voicemail of a Cynthia but was unable to leave a message because her voicemail was full!!! Thanks for the run around!  #shameshame"
0,"This hotel is loud at all hours of the night which the non-smoking room smelling of smoke in the middle of the night and an owner who wouldn't give us towels and said, \""do me a favor and use the dirty ones.\"" Then only gave us two and said that's it (there are three of us.)"
0,"Summary: great location, great micro brew, really good appetizers. So why the 2 stars? Horrible service. \n\nAdvice: if you are waiting for a show, this is not the place to go if you want to watch the beginning of your movie. \n\nI will check back in a month or two. We showed up to have a couple beers and an appetizer before going to the show a couple doors down. Turns out that they opened their doors earlier in the week. We let our waiter know that we were watching the clock for the show bit it didn't help. We had to rush to get out and was still a couple minutes late. \n\nSince they were open for less then a week I am more then willing to give them another chance. They have 5-6 microbrews and give a solid score on all. Their appetizers, amazing. Try the pretzels."
0,"Went here with my parents. Very small and cramped.  Your sitting shoulder to shoulder with people you don't even know. Service was slow. Everyone was nice.. but slow. The waitresses chatted a lot with their own friends instead of taking care of their customers. My mom's food was delicious but my dad was very unhappy. He specifically asked for certain things not to be on his burger and they did it anyway. I think this was partially on the waitresses since they don't write anything down you say. Also, asked for our check and it took them ten minutes to get it to us and no the waitress gave it to us with no pen. Took her a while to come back with a pen since she was socializing.  Just overall not happy with the experience."
1,"Love this place! All the food I've tried is tasty- get the Chicken Pot Pie or any of the sliders. The mac and cheese muffins are tasty, and darling. Everything I've had has been delicious. For drinks- I am on a makers mark kick so I loved the Old Fashioned and the Brown Derby. Fresh juice, so tasty. The decor is a little insane, like some chick's pinterest account exploded on everything, but there's so much to do, so much to look at! There's a freaking boxing ring in the middle! You can play corn hole (beanbags) and ping pong. I have been bringing people here a lot lately. It's just such a fun place!"
0,"I've been a member for over 2 years now. At first, I loved the change from the usual local gym. The instructors were awesome! They were happy and amazing. However the past 6 months or so, the studio has lost it's appeal. And the soap in the bathrooms. Wth, isn't that a health code violation?! The signs that are up asking for tips to keep the instructors are also tacky. Too bad too. This was a perfect location and atmosphere."
0,"I wish I could give them a better review. I just don't think the food is fresh. The service is friendly, but it's just not enough to keep me coming back."
0,A few days ago went to Bonanno's with friends. Although the food was good the atmosphere was not. Unfortunately the entire restaurant overheard a bartender yelling at a server. We all felt very uncomfortable. I did ask the name of the person yelling and found out that it was Donna. This behavior is very unprofessional and should not be tolerated by management. Hope that something is done about this.
0,"This is not a zoo. This place had one or two interesting exhibits, but it was mostly goats and peacocks. There was a fish exhibit in the back where the number of dead fish significantly outweighed the number of living fish. I would definitely NOT recommend this \""park\"" to anyone- and their website is very misleading."
0,"I've used the north location without problems in the past. I live in the SW now so went here despite the bad reviews. I have a q5 with 45k miles on it and only had 4mm left on my front pads. I was told by just brakes that I needed new rotars and told that there's \""not enough metal\"" on them to be re surfaced. The bill would be 650 bucks. (Better than 900 which the dealership quoted me) but I decided to get a 2nd opinion anyway. I took it to another garage on trop/dec and they said they can resurface them and change the pads for under 200 bucks. Always get a 2nd opinion."
1,"If eating 36 ounces of froyo would not be classified as gluttenous, I would have filled 3 cups all the way to the top and totally justified the calories.  (Which I feel fine about because it's like 100 calories for 4 ounces... wait why am I talking about calories?)\n\nMy friend, Jamie, told me to try Yogurtology last week while we were eating at another frozen yogurt place.  She claimed it was the BEST frozen yogurt.  Jamie, I hope you read this because YOU WERE RIGHT!\n\nYogurtology's yogurt is the best I have ever had.  I feel a little sad that my cup is empty and I'm left dreaming about it."
0,"Will was my salesman, and it was the worst experience of my life.  I understand there will be \""snags\"", however there were way too many snags.  It was the worse customer service I have ever received, and actually I am still waiting for resolution on some things.  I started this process in April, and am still not done.  I will never recommend this store to anyone."
1,Never had a problem here before that apparently others have had. Damn fine coffee as always from this chain.
1,Best damn BBQ in AZ! The brisket was awesome. The beef ribs was awesome! The pulled pork was awesome! The sausage was awesome! The sauces were awesome! Can't wait to go back and try the pork ribs!
1,"My in-laws are owners and they've let us use their timeshare several times and we love it (for the most part)...\n\nThe Good:\nThe rooms are AWESOME - think small condo. Every time I stay there my thought is always \""I could live in here\""...It has everything you could possibly need. It has a fully stocked kitchenette, a dinette set, a small living area, a washer/dryer,  a full bath and a partial bath (we had a deluxe unit).\n\nThe rooms are super clean and the staff is always friendly when checking in etc. There are a few restaurants, a hookah lounge, a liquor store, and an ABC store right on the property so you can just run out and grab something if you need to.\n\nThey have an hourly shuttle that takes you back and forth to the strip or it's about a $6 cab ride from the MGM Grand. If you're walkers like we are the walk to the strip is about 10-15 minutes long. There is also a bus stop near the property if you feel comfortable enough to ride the bus (we are experts at the Vegas bus system)...\n\nThe Bad:\nMy in-laws have the MAXIMUM upgrade available and they STILL get pressured to come to \""owner reviews\""...They will keep calling your room every day trying to get you to come to those meetings no matter how many times you tell them no. SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT TO BE ON VACATION AND NOT ATTEND A SALES PITCH MEETING. Once we got it through David's (guest services) head that we were NOT going to attend one of those meetings he was no longer so friendly and nice..."
0,"I wanted to like Tria Terra, I really did. I love being proven wrong after reading Yelp reviews, but it just didn't happen this time. I had purchased a Groupon (Livingsocial?) a while back and it was about to expire, so I figured we'd better check it out. We tried to eat there a week before we actually did, but were told by the hostess, after discovering we didn't have reservations, that \""We are all booked. Well, it might be a couple of minutes.\"" To which I replied, \""Oh really? Like, how long?\"" And she said, \""Well, like an hour.\"" Um, no thanks.\nSo a week later, I made reservations and we were seated promptly. The service was actually very good and our server was helpful in making recommendations and answering weird questions I thought of. They were also very good about attending to my random weird food issues (ie - my hatred of onions). Unfortunately, the food itself left a lot to be desired...even after a bottle of wine.\nWe had the calamari (ordered fried, received grilled, tried it anyway, it was rubbery), the meatballs (overcooked, sauce needed a bit more salt and overall flavor), stuffed zucchini (stuffing was very good, zucchini was a bit undercooked for my taste) and the chicken and potato croquettes (Delicious! If they didn't have pesto sprinkled all over them, really distracted from the flavor of the croquettes and the sauce they are served with).\nI want to like Tria Terra, truly. The atmosphere is surprisingly cute for being in a strip mall, but the food just doesn't warrant another trip."
0,The owner is a condescending unpleasant person who belittles his customers. The food has been on a steady decline for a number of years and is getting worse by the day.  stay far away from this money pit! unless you want to waste money on bad food and a horrible experience.
1,"$17.95 for lunch buffet. When we checked into the hotel they gave us a coupon for 2 for 1 lunch buffet! YES!!\n\nNot too shabby! The cheap buffets are usually the good ones huh? Or maybe I just appreciate it more because it was cheaper! \n\nI love the soup area! There were miso, wonton (3 pcs), shrimp with egg noodles, and even pho with 3 pieces of beef balls! The kind gentleman made my soup in less than 5 minutes! It came out piping hot! There were even fresh basil, green onion, cilantro, yellow onion, and lime! I ordered the pho & wonton. Wonton - 3 stars; it tasted like frozen wontons you get at the market. Pho - 4 stars; tasted decent, it tasted like it could have been \""instant pho\""\n\nThey had a salad station! 5 stars. The gentleman that was making the salad was not wearing gloves! It disgusted me! I really wanted a salad too! But as i worked my way down the area, there was another person making salad! She wore gloves and also had a mixing bowl where she was able to mix the veggies & dressing in! Whereas the dude smashing the veggies down with the palm of his hands and pouring the dressing over and calling it a day! \n\nThe sushi station was just sad! It didn't look fresh - 2 stars.\n\nChinese food area, I can't say much about since I didn't even make it to this area! Which is probably a good thing. \n\nThe BBQ station - 4 stars. BBQ ribs were too salty. Loved the biscuits & gravy, cornbread, pulled pork and chicken fried steak! \n\nDesserts - 4 stars. The dessert station was on the other side of the restaurant. Weird. For a moment i really thought the only desserts they had were fruits! Luckily i walked around! There were tiny donuts! - maple with sprinkles, chocolate, powered, etc. made fresh and was very good! Also about 5 different flavors of ice cream; red velvet, chocolate, vanilla cupcakes; strawberry cheesecakes, cookies of all sorts - i was in heaven! I love desserts! \n\nOverall, 4 stars."
1,"This is a real treat for anyone who wants to get some faith back in great restaurant food that is not overpriced, especially considering the quality of food they serve: organic meats, never-frozen fish, and generous portions."
1,"Good:\n1. Food is pretty good.\n2. Prices are reasonable for Indian food.\n3. Good service. \n\nBad:\n1. If you get there at a certain time they will make you wait until that time's menu is available. \n\nI'm not a fan of Indian food. My tongue cannot handle the spiciness this food typically contains. However, I was in Vegas and this town is about leaving your ol' self at home and trying new experiences. \nSo, I walked in to the restaurant and they were celebrating an event. They server told me that I had to wait 'til 10 pm to place my order. I waited patiently, and one of the owners came over and apologized. \nHe went ahead and took my order. I tend not to eat fish anywhere, so he recommended the Old Delhi style corn fed chicken tikka makhani prepared with ground spices and fenugreek flavoured tomato makhani sauce, served with pulao rice. \nI took it to go. When I got back to my hotel room. I seriously prayed it would not be too spicy. \nI grabbed a spoon and went for taste:\nUmmm, not bad. Hot ,but not... wait, crap, spiciness coming in... where's the rice? Found it! oh! yeah... that's better. Not bad. Ok, let's continue. \nSo, it was basically like this for the rest of the meal; 1 or 2 spoonfuls of Old Delhi chicken and rice. \nOverall, I would def. come here again. It is the only place I've found myself liking the food. I've gone all over the world trying Indian food, except India."
0,"This is probably one of the most popular bars in Shadyside.  They have a  great wine bottle special, and decent (not great) prices otherwise.  The decor is really nice and posh...it kind of makes you want to put on a collared shirt.  The food is also decent, though not spectacular.  Definitely a nice lunch stopover though. \n\nThe problem with the bar is the crowd at night.  I mean it is CROWDED.  It's next to impossible to get a drink at the bar or from the wait staff, who are really trying their best but are just overwhelmed with people!   Drinks are made ok...I wasn't overly impressed.  I want to like the bar more, but the crowds keep annoying me to the point of wanting to leave.  Also, the bar is really packed with the douchiest people in Shadyside as well, so not only are you crowded into oblivion, but also it's like a Jersey Shore episode in there...not fun.  \n\nOverall, it's not a bad place.  The drinks and such are done ok, bue the crowd is just overwhelming at all times.  I'd go elsewhere if given the option."
0,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE customer service!  Paid for Sunday delivery in advance and they don't deliver!  Went four months with getting one single paper!  Took calling them 4 times and finally getting nasty and threatening to go to 8 on your side before we started getting delivery again.  Well that lasted about one month and now back to NO SERVICE!  WTH!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON DELIVERY SERVICE!!
1,"First Hooters experience. Sure were a lot of boobs around the building, but sorry girls, your sets do not compare one of the girls in my party of 3. :)\n\nAll boobs aside, since I was a first timer, my girlfriends gave me a brief crash course of the menu and some recommendations. We started off with fried pickles for appetizers and 20 piece boneless chicken. Not knowing what kind of seasoning we want for our chicken, our Hooters girl was chill enough to allow us to do half and half on certain flavors to explore around. She recommended the Honey Thai seasoning and we chose the Cajun to seal the deal.\n\nOur fried pickles came out, fresh out of the fryer, and we dove right in. Too bad they only gave out one dinky cup of dipping sauce, which completely ran out halfway into our appetizer. They charge extra for extra sauce (oh come on, really?), but we still went ahead and requested some more. Our boneless chicken finally came and I like how each flavors were served in separate plates. The Cajun was spicy, yet tolerable, and indeed SALTY! I suppose that's how Cajun seasoning is supposed to be, but it was alright. The Honey Thai, recommended by our Hooters girl, was probably my favorite. It's sweet, with a hint of spiciness. I would like it if the spiciness was kicked up another notch, but our Cajun wings already covered that department, so it was all good. They were also a bit salty.\n\nOverall, it was a nice and SALTY experience. I think I chugged down 3 cups of water throughout the meal. Our Hooters girl was also nice enough to split our check three ways. She definitely got a nice tip from all of us.\n\nI want to give it 3.5, but had to round up because of the accommodating staff and clean atmosphere.\n\nWarning for those at risk for high blood pressure, this is where sodium dwells."
1,I am not going to be lengthy.  Simple and short.  \n\nIf you live in Phoenix metro area and not using Rob you are making mistake.\n\nThe consummate professional. He doesn't go head and shoulders above what is expected... He goes miles beyond what is expected.
0,"When I order a burger, I want a burger.  If I wanted tasty bacon, lovely cheese, and other fixins... well, I would probably go to a store, buy them, and eat at home.  DDD does great fixins, but I've never enjoyed their burgers.\n\nTo elaborate, I like my burgers to be burger-y.  I want the bun to be fresh, and a good balance to the patty, I want the patty to be cooked as I ask for it (medium-rare) and nice and juicy.  I want the patty to be the *star* of the burger.  \n\nIn 3 visits to DDD, the burger patty has ranged from cardboard-y to slightly less cardboard-y.  The only reason I finished each burger was because of the dump-truck sized amounts of bacon, cheese, jalapenos, and delicious tasting sauce.  Baconcheesejalapeno makes everything taste OK - even shite meat.\n\nSo, if you want a burger loaded with fixins (the combinations, admittedly, are quite creative and well made) then this is your place.  If you want a BURGER, then keep on walking.\n\nAlso, the cheese curds are good, the beer is refreshingly intoxicating, and the location and general \""vibe\"" of the place are nice.  One caveat, when sporting events are occurring, good luck getting a table and when you get one, be prepared for plenty of sozzled undergrads and bros."
1,"5 STARS! A place so good the only bad thing is the $50+ per person check that comes afterwards. Luckily, I got it all free. While waiting for a table we got a top quality Cazadores Reposadas (sp?) tequila on the rocks. It was really strong, and really high-quality. In fact - i've never tasted a tequila like it. Other than Chili's presidente margarita I've never had a higher quality one.\n\nFor appetizor we got the Seafood Maya Relleno - a melted cheese and seafood dish which had real ceviche, rock shrimp, and amazing scallops with some sort of cheddary, spicy cheese on top melted to perfection. 5/5 delicious!!\n\nFor the entrees I ordered the grilled adobo marinated mango salmon over pollento. The salmon was so tender and juicy it melted in my mouth. I was eating tiny little chunks just to savor it all. The pollenta and the sauce it came with was amazing as well 5/5.\n\nMy friend got the chicken enchiladas (I tried to tell her to try something unique like my dish [a top entree], but she insisted on her fav enchiladas, and they were very good - though just enchiladas 4/5. I wish she had gotten something else off the entree menu so that I could try some ha.\n\nFor dessert we shared one of the better flans I've ever tasted. The caramel glaze and design of it were extraordinary. 5/5 Flan!\n\nWashing it down with a reposada refill made it all the better.\n\nA true culinary experience. $120 total bill post tip. Thankfully it was my early bday gift!"
0,"All slumdog, no millionaires.\n\nI read the reviews on here and I wonder if we went in on an off-day. Maybe the Bay Area (where Indian and Asian dining had become a twice-weekly ritual) has spoilt me. I know my Indian food and I've had Indian-Chinese fusion in India. Sorry, this is just not it. I've had better food from the ready-to-eat mixes sold at Vons.\n\nSome comments:\n1) The food didn't not taste fresh at all. Our rice was clearly stale (it gets hard when it's been sitting for a while).\n2) Excessive use of food coloring - I have never seen bloody red butter chicken. Now I have.\n3) Disorganized - They didn't seem to have a staff when we went in. The mom took our oder, the dad microwaved our food and brought it out and the son sold over-priced Indian trinkets by the door. \n\nI wasn't a a great fan of Tava (the Indian restaurant that occupied the premises before Jai Ho) but in retrospect I miss it. Jai Ho simply doesn't stand up to better Indian alternatives further north. I give it less than 6 months before this cursed location switches management again. Go to the Thai restaurant next door instead."
1,"Truffle fries were excellent.  You can pass on the duck and pork belly buns.  The iced tea was terrible, boba was not good.  Miagi burger was really good.  Cooked perfectly, juicy and tangy.  It was a little oily though but still good."
0,"Clases are great,instrutors are great. That said the real problems with the experience need to be addressed. The parking and class size are both a tremendous problem. If everyone is aware of these problems (managment /owner) then maybe you need to address the concerns of your members,however you are not ,what you are doing is still trying to get more members hence the everpresent Groupons and Living Social deals. I have opted not  to get a year membership because of the parking and class size. When you cannot spread your arms because they end up in someones face, chances are the class is to full. When you have anxiety about parking and getting a place for your mat without entering the class to early and pissing off another member its just not worth the hassle. The whole experience should be enjoyable and clealry the parking and class size prevent this."
0,I knew I shouldn't have stopped.  All my other visits over the years had been terrible but I was really craving fried shimp and couldn't imagine how they could screw it up.  Well...$8 later after eating 3 flavorless greasy shrimp and picking at the fish I threw it away because I knew I was going to throw up if I ate any more.  It was THAT bad.  Where is the corporate or owner quality control on this product and to make it worse the cashier was an idiot lost in his own world - What's a combo...dah it's a number 9 with chicken.  OK what's a number 9?
1,"I've been seeing Laura here for about 4 years now, ever since I first went to her to rescue me from the worst haircut of my life.\n\nI've never been one to get my hair cut on a regular basis but now, because of Laura, I see her every 7-8 weeks and my hair is longer and healthier than it's ever been in my adult life.\n\nShe ALWAYS asks before cutting off any significant length. She truly cares that her clients are happy and she's very open and honest with her opinion. We've played around with a lot of different color and there isn't anything she has done that I HAVEN'T loved.\n\nCan I possibly get any MORE glowing in this review? Yeah, Laura is THAT fantastic."
1,"Greeted with \""Buona sera signorina\"", the sound of accordion background music, and an array of ice cream flavours as I walked through the door of La Favorita, I was instantly cheered out of my lethargic state. Not least because the twinkly-eyed waiter called me \""young lady\"" - this kind of complimentary talk earns anyone an instant tip as far as I'm concerned. This eatery is the kind of classic, traditional Italian experience which has to produce at least a smile from visitors, even if you've had the worst day at work ever/been dumped/dropped your favourite ornament/are a generally grumpy individual.\n\nI opted for the Risotto Imperiale, a tasty, well presented, affair, which came with jumbo, juicy prawns and a langoustine with one claw perched on top of a generous portion of rice and champagne sauce. My very critical fellow diner, definitely a pizza enthusiast, went for the Pizza ai due Salami, which after a few minutes of careful munching he announced was \""very good\"", definitely high praise for him, before continuing to devour the rest of his meal, (only offering me a small slither).\n\nLa Favorita has a pretty extensive menu, with all the dishes on offer you would expect from an Italian restaurant, so if you've got a craving for decent pasta and pizza somewhere different, where you're not paying over the odds, take a wander away from the centre of town and get down to Leith Walk."
1,"Did the 1/2 of the half.  I've always wanted to run the strip, so when my wife found this event online, I jumped at it.  It was exactly what I wanted, and I will definitely go back and do it again next year (or more likely, the half).  Great course, great weather.  Everyone was out there to have fun, and running down the strip you had thousands of people cheering you on.  Great atmosphere.\n\nOnly things I'd want to see improved:  I think some of the mile markers were missing from the 1/2 of the 1/2.  And I would have liked it if they would have had chronotrack or something like it so I could see my pace and actual finish time.  \n\nOther than that, I'd highly recommend it.  Definitely going back in 2014."
1,Just moved to vegas and we have been trying all the Hawaii flavor eateries.  They have 2 sides to the restaurant the sushi side and then the plate lunch side we did not know that but we were able to order from borh sides in the dining sushi side.  Food was great service great and you can order poi 9 dollars delivery on thursday. Will be back
1,"Now I know it's just another shopping centre but A) it's got free parking B) has a big cinema and C) lots of shops and places to eat.\n\nOk a lot of places to eat are chain, in fact most of them are. My favourite chain has to be Zizzi's, as they always have an offer on and it's tasty (but the place always feels cold, perhaps the air con).  You have The Handmade Burger Co, Bella Italia, Pizza Express, A chinese, a coffee bar and the main eating area.\n\nFree Parking is good because the Omni Complex is expensive.  Plus there is plenty of spaces too.\n\nOcean terminal is set on three floors all of which are accesible by moving stairs and lifts.  Most of the shops are on the ground and first floor with the eating places on the third.  Frankie and Benny's are the lastest chain to be installed here.  You have Sbux and Costa for coffee addicts like myself."
1,"My wife and I come here regularly. The food is very good and they have a nice variety. The Italian.selections are fantastic. Especially the baked ziti. Also, great service!"
1,"First of all, let me state that this place was so packed when I get in there that most fast food places would have been eaten alive by the crowd.  Here, however, they calmly churn through the people and I still had my food within 10 minutes.\n\nBeing an In-N-Out virgin, I didn't know what to expect.  However, I got some tips from a friend's boyfriend about this whole \""secret menu\"" business, and decided that mustard grilled was going to be the way to go.  \n\nIt definitely was.  This may have been one of the all-time best fast food burgers I've ever had.  The fact that the burger comes deluxe automatically is a big plus for me.  Definitely a good decision on my part to go here while in Vegas, which I only did because of the fact they were mentioned briefly in \""The Big Lebowski.\"""
1,"I had been going to LA Fitness for a couple years. I also coach high school sports and run some of the training, so I thought I had a good grasp on fitness. The problem was that at LA Fitness I was temped to do only the things I wanted to do... basketball, elliptical machine, and a few other things that I felt good about, but honestly I had almost no results. \n\nMy friend suggested North Scottsdale Crossfit. The diversity of the exercises and how quick the workouts were really appealed to me. \n\nKevin, the instructor, introduced me to the correct form and encourages intensity but  nothing crazy. After you get going there is a fun environment of encouragement and competition, mainly with yourself to beat your previous marks. \n\nFor those who already know about Crossfit, you will find an authentic Crossfit experience, not a cardio-class that occasionally incorporates the Crossfit approach.  \n\nI highly recommend North Scottsdale Crossift."
1,"Typical Brasserie style restaurant - nice, yet comfortable.  The setting at the Venetian is very nice...especially if you can eat outside on the patio.  Great selection of drinks, food was exceptional, and the waitstaff was very good.  Recommended!"
0,"Horrible customer service. No one helped me pick out a dress, or in dressing room. I was told one thing and then another. I wouldn't recommend going here."
1,This place is awesome! This frazzled mom lost her debit card and they gave me most of my meal for free after I paid the cash I had. Not many places would do that! I will for sure be back often. The food was great and my son loves the play land! Love a place with such great customer service!
1,"If I could give 4.5 I would.  Bumped up to five partially because there are very few restaurants like this in mesa.  By that I mean local,  non chain, nice decor.  Basically it has a Scottsdale feel in east mesa.  I usually get the calzone, it's enough for two to split and get full.  Don't get me started on the bread. .. the poor waiter always has to bring me a couple refills.  Pricy,  but not overpriced.  A good place to celebrate."
0,The company was much better than the food.  China Panda could give them a run for thier money.
1,"Everyone from Nebraska thinks they're an expert on beef, and I'm no exception.  City Hall is as good as it gets.  I've eaten at every over-hyped NY steakhouse from Peter Luger's to the 837 Palm, and every douchehole joint in LA and LV, and the only place that MIGHT be better is Gibson's in Chicago - and that's just a maybe.  \n\nFilet - top notch.  Porterhouse - the best.  KC Strip - unrivaled anywhere.  \nThe only way to get a better steak is to fly to Omaha, go to Stoysich, grab a slab and cook that sumbitch yourself.  Sides - you can't miss with any, but the creamed corn brings out the corn-fed in me.  Awesome.  And the butter cake... manna from heaven, kids.  Excellent selection of booze and wine.  Always top service.  \n\nQuite frankly, I'm amazed at how long this place has stayed awesome - gotta be at least 7 or 8 years now?  The best."
0,"My late birthday was held here last night -- 10 adults 2 children. The bill came out to be 330$ and we tipped 50$. The service was awesome - always on top of our refills, changing out our hot plates and dealing with the two erratic children pacing around the whole restaurant, but the food was Meh... \n\nI've been to an AYCE Korean BBQ (Tofu Hut) before and prefer their meat than what meat we tasted here. And the prices are MUCH cheaper there than here. The sushi was not good and so plain. The one thing my boyfriend and I liked the most was the soup -- mine being the beef raddish soup and his the kimchi soup. The dessert section was small as well as their salad bar. \n\nFor the price per head it was, and even the kids being charged 13$ per child, I was highly disappointed..."
0,Standard take out and it's cheap. Service is fast and friendly. I go here when I'm too lazy to walk to Zaw's or pressed for time (I've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes).
0,"Don't go here.  We ate dinner across the way at circus circus, and decided to check it out.  I ordered a Grey Goose with Redbull, and the server came back with a drink.  I  knew right away it wasn't Redbull but I can look past that.  I ordered the same thing with a different waitress, and she informed me that they didn't have Redbull or grey goose.  Hmmm...so the last server lied to me and just served me what they had.  Manager didn't seem to care.   Just stay away from this run down property."
0,"Definitely not my scene. Brought here by a few drunken friends. I'm in my mid 20's and my husband late 20's, this place is definitely for the 55+ crowd. Lot of HOGs in there, meaning of a lot of men. Few women, mostly 65+. I felt a little embarrassed just being inside this place. \n\nHad one drink, I did not order it myself however. It was incredibly sweet, left my lips very sticky."
1,"Great fast Chinese food like you would find in NYC - try it. Cheap & fresh, love this place."
0,"Went in on a Sunday right at open.  Ambiance was great. Such a shame that the decor and comfort of the restaurant doesn't translate to the food. We first had calamari which was far from good. All I could taste is oil and mayo. For a genuine Italian restaurant,  it was terrible. I had the seafood main dish which had scallops, shrimp, mussels, etc. I would rate it a 6/10, the pasta itself was way overcooked. The server Denny, only checked on us ONCE the entire hour and a half we were there,  so customer service was also terrible.  On the flip side,  the salad that came with the calamari was very good. Finally we had tirsmisu for desert and that was also very good. Rated it a one due to mediocre food and terrible customer service. Maybe it's because I was spoiled with amazing Italian food when I lived in Chicago....."
1,"I come here all the time, admittedly because my building is directly next to it. The food is much better than you would expect from this type of bar (while maybe slightly overpriced) and service is usually really good. In fact, the busier it gets the better the service! Really fun, chill atmosphere. I have been going here at least once a week for over a year and have never had a complaint.\n\nToday I made a to-go order for the first time because I was craving All American's sweet potato fries (they are incredible) and they told me my order would be ready in 10 minutes. They took a longer than ten minutes, and didn't charge for the order because of the delay.\n\nI didn't think I could ever love this place more than I already did!"
0,"I'm pretty irritated that my 2 pizzas, quoted at 19-29 minutes just took 1hr 8 minutes to get here. Completely unacceptable. I'm shocked it was even warm at all. Though the cheese was no longer melty. And James was hardly apologetic. I'll order from Val Vista next time."
1,"The negative reviews posted on here are out of date.  \n\nI stayed at this Ramada last week and it was absolutely beautiful.  The room was modern and clean, the staff was friendly, and the continental breakfast was delicious.  I would happily stay here again.  The only negative-ish comment I have is that it's directly behind a \""gentlemen's club\""  but, truthfully, once I got into the room I couldn't care less about what was next door, the hotel room was a nice retreat after a long day of driving."
1,"I scheduled my appointment via phone for my two cats.  All I needed was to get their claws trimmed and their teeth brushed and the guy scheduled me.  When I went into the store they didn't even ask me my name.  They saw I had a kitten (was only able to catch one of my kittens, the other wouldn't leave the house that day) and immediately took care of her.  Obviously it's mostly dogs, and as the guy said on the phone, if there is a cat in there they will do them first because they don't want the cats stressing out.  Love that!  So I got Zoey's claws trimmed, and to my dismay, she was being a lot easier on this professional!  I felt betrayed, Zoey is always giving me a hard time when I clip her claws.  Then I asked about the teeth brushing (this is where 5 stars goes to 4) and the lady said that cats don't need their teeth brushed because the foam doesn't work the same way it would for dogs.  Now, this is the first time I've ever heard this.  I've even looked it up before and from most of my reading it says cats should get their teeth brushed (some even say as often as humans).  Maybe that's her opinion, and while I would've preferred her to just brush them anyway, she just gave her some breath-spray instead.  Which is fine.  The customer service I received was great, but it still is confusing to me how the guy on the phone allowed me to scheduled a teeth cleaning but when I go in there, this lady tells me they don't do that for cats.  Hmm.  Just a bit of some confusion there.  Anyway, it was 5 dollars to get the claws trimmed and I was in and out in 5 minutes as well, overall great experience!  All the grooming seems to be done out in the open, which is really good to see, they shouldn't have anything to hide.  Everyone else in there was friendly."
1,"My fiance and I got half-price tickets for this show. I was expecting it to be mediocre. I've been to Medieval Times a couple times and I didn't enjoy that very much. However, my fiance loves this sort of stuff and has never seen anything like it so we decided to go.\n\nI had a great time. The show was so much fun to watch, and the audience is small enough so that you don't feel lost in the crowd, but large enough so you really feel a positive presence when everyone's cheering.\n\nThe actors were very charismatic and very good at bringing the audience into it. The servers were incredibly friendly and delightful to talk to. The food was fantastic. I'm a vegetarian so at first I was afraid that I would get some disgusting eggplant dish like they offer at Medieval Times, but I got a delicious plate of pasta (fork and all!), fresh vegetables, delicious potatoes, a biscuit, and a bowl of godly tomato soup. Oh man that soup was good. My fiance said his cornish game hen was excellent as well.\n\nThey have free soda or diet soda, as well as a menu of alcoholic drinks you can purchase. On the menu was a souvenir mug for $18 but for some reason we were only charged $14. That was fine with us. You can get it filled with beer, daiquiris, margaritas, etc. It was a pretty big mug; almost everyone in France purchased one.\n\nSome people said they were worried about dirt getting in their food. We sat in the second row, maybe the first row is much different but I felt no fear of that.\n\nThere were a few very large booms that scared the bejeezus out of us. It was hilarious.\n\nThe only complaint that I have is this: Before the show someone goes around with a camera taking your picture, then they bring it to you blown up on a small cardboard frame and leave it at your station. They did this without saying anything. I was silly enough to assume that was ours to keep. I was utterly devastated when, at the end of the show, they came back around and told us it would be $20 to keep this picture pasted onto a piece of cardboard. I know we paid half price, but people pay as much as $70 a ticket and they want $20 more for something they're going to throw out anyway? I think that should have been worked into the price of the ticket, or at least have been considerably cheaper. Or, at the VERY least, we should be told beforehand that we can't just keep it so as not to get our hopes up. I can't tell you how disappointed I was about that.\n\nI probably wouldn't go out of my way to see the show again - like others have said, once you've seen it once, you've seen it a thousand times - and I don't know if I'd have gone if I'd have had to pay $70, but if you can get tickets on the cheap then I recommend it, definitely, especially if you have kids."
1,"glory be to tandoori eee\n\ni heart this place so much, and that means more than you. raj rani is the cutest, i swear she is hopped up on ginkgo biloba because you can come in with a party of 6+ and she never forgets the who's and the what's.\n\n appetizers are meh....but the chicken fraizee and chicken tikka are sexlectric. get the tikka and you will understand. \n\nspecial naan is flipping good as well, but i usually go with onion kulcha or pudina parantha. the bar is shiny and someday i will drink to drunk here...but i will not over do it because the last place you would want to be flailing around would be the ladies room stall. yes,it is still there...it's gone from disgusting to endearing. my favorite transition, actually.  i have come here hungover..it's a miracle really. sweet lassi will cure many an ailment.\n\nthe sticky balls are delish but if you go during buffet hours your balls will be hot, i prefer them chilled, better for the syrup. \n\ni highly recommend this place...i wish they were open for breakfast."
0,"There's a reason why this Pho place closes early compared to most places. Simply put, like your dad or mom have probably have said about your exs, you could do so much better.\n\nI went here with my fiancee just for a quick lunch. I had the pho tai and she had bun cha. (Bun cha is rice vermicelli with fried spring rolls usually accompanied by seasoned fish sauce in case you are wondering.) Now going to Jenni Pho, Pho being the namesake of the restaurant, you think you would get something that is standard or above par. Not so much. Like opening a can of peanuts and getting snakes instead, I was quickly disappointed and surprised at how disappointing it was. The broth was weak and I felt I could have done better with a packet of ramen. The noodles were alright and the beef was eh. My fiancee's dish didn't far any better. Her vermicelli was cold. Not cold as in it was hot in the window and probably got cold after waiting for a little bit. No. It was cold as in grabbing it from a lowboy cold. The spring rolls were also mediocre at best. Service was not bad and seemed apologetic for the most part. The floors were a little messy and the restaurant having not been busy when we were there, I can only say probably due to laziness. \n\nCompeting against other established Pho institutions in Chinatown is rough but at least bring your full game. Just felt like this place needs a lot of improvements in the kitchen work for this place to be at least somewhat approachable again."
0,"Not sure why such high reviews.  Other than the friendly girl at the front counter this was pretty mediocre.  There was a kind-of dirty-plus-cleaning products odor to the place, there was a bussing tray sitting right next to the ordering counter the whole time.  The seats still had crumbs on them and the table some grease spots.  There's no ambiance and are no amenities - pizza delivered on a plastic tray, cheap plastic dishes for eating it, paper or styrofoam cups for the serve-yourself drinks.  This isn't an imaginative Italian restaurant with good food, table service,and nice tables and chairs.  It's a cheap pizza place with vinyl booths, windows with hand prints, and get-it-yourself silverware.\n\nThe food - well, it was fine for the price, but there are tons of places that serve decent pizza these days.  Granted this was better pizza than, say, Domino's, but that doesn't say too much.  There was a decent amount of cheese, but it's not like the quality of ingredients particularly stood out.  Pale tasteless tomato chunks, for example.\n\nI didn't see that this Barro's, at least, had much to recommend it."
0,"bland flavorless boiled meat.... i got teriyaki pork, yes the meat was tender and perfectly cook alas it was totally tasteless i got up to ask for more sauce and she handed me what i thought was vinaigrette but it was just the most watered down teriyaki sauce ever... it was almost clear... so then i asked for the sweet and sour sauce also almost flavorless. my friend asked for the brown rice they wer e out of it but didnt tell her until they brought her food to the table. she also got the vgitarian bowl and it was frozen mixed veggies, carrots broccoli and cauliflower with rice that was it for $7.00 and she said her veggies were still cold.. the pinapple on the plate was still green and totally unripe. the coconut icecream was good the grandmoms chocolate cake was still raw inside and seemed like very under cooked brownies.. i wouldnt waste your money here.. go somewhere else..."
1,"This is a great value if you really take advantage of all if the exhibits that they have to offer. I did read many reviews ahead of time and figured that it would be a small themed museum that you could spin through in 45 minutes to a hour- WRONG!! \nWhen we got there the friendly staff informed us that we should allow about 3 hours. \""Yeah, right\"", I thought, \""I'm not that into this stuff! How can there be that much to see?!\"" I was mistaken! \nThey have done a great job of presenting a wide variety of exhibits that address the different aspects of organized crime (the most notorious mobsters, women who were involved with the business, children who grew up around this lifestyle, the impact organized crime had on Vegas, etc). There are so many topics that they cover and they really offer some very interesting interactive exhibits that keep you more engaged than just a wall of information and pictures. \nI actually short changed myself at this museum because I planned poorly and went before lunchtime. After about 3 hours we were so hungry that we had to finish our tour so we wouldn't waste away for hunger. I wish that I had planned better so we could have stayed another hour or so to be able to finish up all the exhibits at the pace that we had been going. We found it very engaging and I was surprised to know how interested I ended up being in Mob history!"
1,"I'll admit up front Liberty Market is my all time favorite restaurant, and I love it.  Spent a lot of time and money there.  They even allowed us to have our small rehearsal dinner for our wedding there and it was FANTASTIC.\nPros: everything.  Food is great--ALWAYS.  People are great--ALWAYS.  They are friendly, attentive and enjoy being alive.  My favorite dish, the salmon BLT... HIGHLY recommend it.  It's fabulous.  Breakfast is also GREAT here.\nOnly thing you could complain about is it gets really busy, but that's what happens to good restaurants.\nThis is a must-visit restaurant... might become your favorite too!"
0,"Bottom line: Not every person who speaks French qualifies as a artisan bread maker. If they try to sell the baguette and tarts in Paris,  I'm pretty sure that Parisians would throw the baguette right back at them.\n\nThe \""European Gourmet\"" sign on their window need justifications."
1,"I have been here twice and for the most part I have had a lot of fun. A few things you should know beforehand. First, go earlier in the day if you don't want to be absolutely destroyed by teenagers; especially if you have younger kids. I took my girlfriends six year old daughter and she had a hard time competing with teenagers who would shoot her relentlessly for the points. After the first game, I got her to follow me around and she did a lot better (Perhaps they felt differently about trying to pick on someone who is 6'5 and 250 Pounds and I could explain to her how to play). Secondly, it helps to have an understanding of how the game works. Most people score a lot of points because they can hit all four bases of the opposing colors. Even if you only have two teams playing, there are three colors and the other two colors opposing bases can still be shot. (I learned that after game 1). Despite some of these issues my girlfriend's daughter still had a good time and the staff did a great job of catering to her. They also try and break the teams up so it wasn't us against teenage laser tag assassins.  Kudos to them for that. All in all, it was a good experience."
1,this place is near my house. it has become my hangout not only because it is cliose but the food is great.$2.50 draft beers on mondays.
0,"Prices and portions are a little better than Jamba Juice, and food selection is decent.\n\nWent by late last night, I  got one of their superfood smoothies- the Mean Green(?), with kale and spinach and mango and pineapple. Get it with Splenda to save some cals, and the smoothie is a meal at 380 cals. Very filling, very tasty, very sweet.\n\nJoined their website and got an email for a 99 cent smoothie with purchase of a sandwich or wrap. Before I got a chance to even print that up, another coupon came up for TODAY- $1.99 for their curry chicken salad or wrap, and it's decent. Don't know if I'd pay full price for it, but coupons and deals seem to come around often.\n\n\nEDIT:\nApparently this location's management is now picking and choosing when to honor the company website coupons. I understand franchises are able to opt out of promotions, and the small print always states \""at participating locations\"", but if they honor one they should honor all. And with all of the smoothie competition they have in this area, and my observations of the amount of business they do, they can't really afford to be turning away customers.\nI'll be spending my money elsewhere from now on- getting turned away for a $2 discount coupon that is ON THE COMPANY WEBSITE was a total waste of my lunch break today (3/26/14). If you're going to benefit from the advertising your host company provides, you need to honor their discounts as well."
0,"I usually try to give Vegas hotels several chances before writing a review. I rarely take photos for Yelp, but this was a must. I have only posted two photos on Yelp, ever! I'm actually creating a Trip Advisor account to review this hotel as well. However, this one did not make the cut! Even my extremely mellow husband, who does not like to complain, had it with this hotel! I would give them ZERO STARS. \n\nGood:\nThe hotel is still close enough to the strip to take a cab or taxi to other hotels for clubs or gambling. The hotel lobby is nice, everything \""looks\"" newly-renovated. I like the color scheme. The hotel itself, looked very clean. The couch, the soaking tub, rainfall shower, pleather couch, two TVs, are a plus. But they weren't the best amenities. Oh another plus is that they have gates that require a key to get in, but they leave the gates open during the day. What good does the key card reader do if it's open during the day? Because only burglar/predators come out a night? We received complimentary chocolate-covered strawberries, but the strawberries were not fresh. Dog-friendly hotel! But we didn't get a dog-friendly hotel, because they were sold out. Which is fine. \n\nBad:\nWe get there, we found a body mist spray, baseball cap, and sunglasses in the room. I seriously felt like I walked into another couple's room!! The bed was NOT made. It looked like someone had just rolled out of bed. The soaking tub was FILTHY! The rainfall shower was nice, but it had a huge crack in it and lime, rust, and calcium was building up on the crack. REPLACE IT. The closet door is also messed up and broken. I found dog hair all over the room! What if someone was allergic to dogs? Tell me again how the room had dog hair and you were out of dog-friendly rooms? LAW SUIT PLEASE! I found PUBIC HAIRS all over the bathroom too! GROSS!! Trust me, those hairs aren't mine or my husband's. We are hygiene FREAKS! OCT TO THE MAX! The room was very dimly lit, I love lighting. I love to see how I look before I got out for the day/night. We did not receive a \""DO NOT DISTURB\"" sign. The guy at the front desk handed us one as we were going out. Seriously? LAZY F**KS! There is no elevator in the hotel. I did not see any fire extinguishers on the second level of the hotel. The hotel does not seem accessible for those with disabilities. A lot of the walls had paint chipped. No casino in the hotel. I was hungry but was getting ready to go out and wanted food from the restaurant in the hotel lobby. The restaurant was CLOSED! During a huge Spring Break weekend too!! WTF? There is no microwave OR refrigerator in the hotel! Seriously?! What hotel does not have a refrigerator?! Housekeeping might as well be non-existent. Room service? There is none! Front desk? Even worse than the non-existent room service.\n\nTo sum up, we were \""eh\"" about staying here, even just to rest our heads after going out on the strip. We had to sleep OVER the sheets with a tiny sheet because the bed was not made. We called and asked more than FIVE times to have our room turned over. We had to get pizza delivered to us (it was good pizza!!! I think the place was Joe's NY Pizza or something, can't remember). We had to clean the filthy tub, with someone else's soap scum ourselves! FILTHY, FILTHY, FILTHY! Their hospitality is non-existent. \n\nI didn't use the pool (probably gross too) or go on the balcony. They had landscaping I think, because the whole hotel smelled like disgusting fertilizer, which is weird because they don't even have real grass! They use AstroTurf! This hotel was basically for us to rest our heads after long night of partying, which we couldn't even rest comfortably! Avoid. Just avoid this hotel."
1,"Went here after a friend suggested it. Haven't been able to find great sushi, since we came back from visiting Japan. I have to say that this place is great. The service is wonderful, the sushi chef is great, they have great drink specials and the food is amazing. \n\nI couldn't believe how fresh the fish was and how knowledgeable about the variety of sushi and sashimi the chef was (amazing accent too, he's from Spain and raised in Costa Rica). \n\nThe location is a little out of place, even my GPS couldn't find it...but the location made it very quaint!!!\n\nThey have the freshest fish/seafood around, actually they have the freshest fish/seafood I've had, since visiting Japan and eating the sushi there!! Hands down, it's the best sushi, service and atmosphere in the East Valley area."
1,"Love this place. It's bright, sunny, and modern inside with an excellent menu. The service is lovely and coffee to die for. They even have stevia on the tables. The manager is warm and friendly and remembered I'd ordered their lovely gluten-free protein pancakes on my previous visit, and today just brought me some for dessert, his treat. These nice touches will keep me coming back. Happy to see this place and can't wait for the patio to open."
1,"Yum! For all those skeptics who fear trying vegan cuisine, this is the place to start. I have not had anything on the menu that I disliked, and you would never know that these dishes are completely free of animal products. The Green Burger and the Mexicali Burger totally satisfy my need to chomp into a big ol' burger, which I occasionally miss since I became a vegetarian. The Drunken Mushroom \""Chicken\"" Bowl is amazing. All of the vegan \""meats\"" and \""cheeses\"" they use at Green are awesome. They even sell some of them in their mini grocery store so you can take that vegan deliciousness home with you. And the desserts... oh, boy! If you haven't tried it already, go now!"
0,"Well i was taking my partner on a romantic \""stay-cation\"" after being together for five years and never doing anything like this i thought what an amazing idea for a birthday gift! a night away from the 3 kids (our dogs) ! i was pumped about the water park and the suite! when we got there we were greeted wonderfully! we got our room key fast ! and was directed to our room personally! i felt very \""Luxury\"" per say.\n\n Our room was perfect size! we had a great view! very comfortable bed! and lots of towels! so far so good! we were super hungry! and i was still super excited that my surprise had works and so far was going perfect. We went to the Grill in the lobby for dinner. \n\nThe food was , how do i say this.... gross... and over priced! as a starter we got \""Asian inspired chips and dip\"" it was basically fried won-ton noodles and mayo, it was like eating a heart attack. for dinner we both ordered the club , it was thick cut meat that didn't taste fresh and burnt Bacon. We also ordered two pina coladas even tho they tasted wonderful to our surprise we both sipped up sharp plastic ! after the waitress (Amanda, the rudest waitress ever) brought back a new one the explanation i got was \"" Oh! it was part of the box sorry! here's a larger one!\"" . all i can say is dessert was NOT on the agenda. \n\nThe next day we went to the water park, it was beautiful and clean and the women at the entrance was very nice! we did just so happen to forget our IDs in the car so we said if we want to drink we will go get them but for now we will just swim and have fun. After a while in the lazy river and enjoying tanning by the wave pool we thought lets give that pina colada another try, this time we can watch while she makes it. \n\nWe went all the way back to our car to retrieve our IDS so we can get an orange wrist band (that means you can drink) . The woman at the entrance was very nice and great full that we walked to our car to get our IDs she then gave us the new bands so we were good to go.\n\n once back in the pool area again we went to the bar. We were ignored at first , she asked people who had just walked up as if we weren't waiting there looking at her. way before even saying hello to us, with out making ANY eye contact she said\n \""what can i get you girls\""\n no \""hello!\"" ? we ordered the Prickly pear and strawberry colada's (very good) she looked up and said nothing but continued making the ofter peoples drinks. Then after finishing with the other people Never once asking for Their IDs she came back and said \"" Ill need to see IDs\"" rude as if we we stole these bracelets.  Now i know we look young but are we not wearing orange wrist bands?? so either you don't trust the woman at the gate or you don't want my 9.50$ a drink! \nTrust me i am all for NO underage drinking but if I'm spending this much money to stay here and have a drink i don't want to feel like I'm being questioned or have some one insinuate I'm lying . \n\nAll and All would i go back yes... but could the employees use some serious attitude adjustments ? YES! just cause I'm 25 does not mean my 300$ isn't as good as anyone Else's."
0,"Interesting reading other reviews complaining about the rude owner too. It is the main reason I will never put my foot in Cafepino again, apart from the fact that it is overpriced. I much prefer to go to AMC Desert Ridge and have drinks and appetizers half price during happy hour at the Yard House, where the manager is welcoming and cares about his customers.\nEight of us went to movies and had dinner at Cafepino last month. The food was okay but I had to cancel dessert because it took so long to arrive and our movie was starting in a few minutes. We were there long before the movie started to have enough time to eat. When we wanted to pay separately because everyone didn't have cash, the owner scoffed at us and basically said he couldn't accommodate us, only one person had to pay. We were all shocked at how rude he was and decided to move our once-a-month movie night to a different location. Good job in loosing eight customers in one fell swoop. Bon chance!"
1,"PAPA, as us pinball nerds know it, is the mecca for pinball.  A fantastic facility run by awesome pinball people.  Got to drop by most recently to help pack stuff up for Pinball Expo, but ended up hanging out more and playing some games.  Fantastic organization!"
1,Waitress was very knowledgeable about flavors of fish which is great for fish newbies like me.
0,"PAID CASH but STILL charged CREDIT.  WILL NOT REFUND.  Ordered by phone, gave credit card info. Pizza was delivered to hotel room, but driver insisted card was not billed and he needed cash.  Total was $52.17, gave $60 cash. The next day, $52.17 was still billed to credit card.  \n\nAfter repeated attempts to get a refund, calling the business daily, no refund was issued.  In 30 days of promises, I never got a single call back.  I finally had direct contact with the owner after 30 days. He informed me delivery driver had quit and kept the cash, but that as a business owner, he had to make his money somehow.  I pointed out that in order for him to make his $52.17, I was then paying $112.17 for my pizza. He said he can't control what the driver did, though as the business owner who hired the driver, he is responsible for the drivers theft.  No matter what, the customer should not pay twice.  \n\nThe owner had NO signed receipt but still refused to refund the money to the card.  He agreed I paid cash, agreed that he had not returned my phone calls, even agreed that I was told I would not be charged on my card.  This business owner simply seeks profits and will not accept any responsibility for his poor hiring choices.  \n\nI do not suggest giving them your credit card information - though I am sure the owner would really prefer sticking to cash sales anyway given his interest in profits."
1,"This place is delicious. After finally dragging my arse out of Artisan Roast down the way, I managed to crawl into this store and my eyes opened with amazement! \n\nSo much awesomely delicious food! \n\nI am vegetarian and gluten-free so I tend to have a hard time shopping for food sometimes.\n\nFear no more - Real Foods is here! (by the way, how much do you love that name? It's so true, it's actually selling real food! Not packaged, chemically-induced crap)\n\nThe place isn't massive but they pack it in there pretty well to give you all the amazing foods you could want!\n\nI would have to agree with Jenny though that the reason why they only get 4 stars instead of 5 is for their larger than my pocketbook price tags. Some things are just a little too expensive for my teeny tiny wallet and my even teenier tiny paycheck. So yes, I will be coming back but I suppose I will have to make wise food choices here in order to stretch my money a little more so I can just have a little more spice in my life!"
0,"Last night I had THE WORST movie experience of my life. I'm better off just listing everything one by one\n1. The wait to get into this place was probably longer than any concert I've ever been to. You would've thought there was a celebrity inside or something. I was with my sister and we were in our car waiting for 50 minutes to get in. There is only one way out and its forwards thru the cashier's booth at the end so we were stuck with no option but to keep moving forward. \n2. Despite arriving early before the movie was supposed to even show we decided to stay (since we waited so long) and watch the last half of the movie until the next showing. The only reason we did this was because the drive GETTING OUT was just as bad as getting in. \n3. There is no organization whatsoever as far as the layout goes, drive roads, or overall theater layout. The theaters were so packed close together that I could hear the dialogue from every single movie playing. We were that close to each other. \n4. In the same note, parking in the theater lot was next to impossible because the space was not properly utilized. It was a free for all parking scenario. Drive thru's when I was a kid had properly marked spots (like any parking lot) this place had none.  Once we parked we basically got locked in behind an enormous van that blocked half the screen. Not only should the theater lots should be properly marked but should probably be on a sloop to ensure everyone can see the screen. \n5. At the end of the first showing (which we missed half of, remind you) as soon as cars started leaving we moved closer to the screen to ensure a better view. Awesome, right? WRONG! Didn't matter where we parked because there were screaming, yelling children running amok. the noise level from neighbor cars was just outright annoying not to mention we could still hear the noise from the other movies. Should there not be walls, gates or something acting a sound barrier between each theater? \n6. The second showing of the movie was supposed to start at 10:30 (because we had missed the first half of the first showing we were going to stay and wait to see the second showing) but it didn't start till about 11:20 and even then we had no warning until 11:10 We had the station they played the audio for the movie on the whole time. Between movies they played indie which is fine but it wasn't until 11:20 that we got an announcement on the radio from the theater employees saying they sorry for the inconvenience but because there were people still waiting to get in the theater that the movie would be starting late.\n7. About the last 20 minutes of the film it just cut off. NOTHING no MOVIE! The screen went completely blank and people started honking like crazy. Understandable, however, extremely annoying. It did start back up again after a few minutes but at the beginning of the previews then it went back out again. \n8. At that point we decided to just leave. As we drove silently away we became very confused as to where the exit was because people apparently were parked in the poorly paved/marked road that led to the exit. We had to drive our car thru a labyrinth of parked cars, people in seats and children running around. Of course we got dirty looks from people because.\nEven with the cheap ticket prices (they only take cash) double feature options (which we didn't use but were excited to know about going in) and the comfort of our own car and snacks (we never bothered with the concession stand, we're not that adventurous) there was absolutely NO redeeming qualities and I would not suggest going to this place unless they do a complete overhaul of EVERYTHING."
0,"I took a group of 11 to this Thai restaurant this last Sunday, January 15th around 6:30. We were all in the mood for Thai and since this restaurant was able to seat us we were happy.\n When we arrived at the table we were short a seat and asked for another one as there was an entire table in our area that didn't have a seat at it but it was connected to our row of tables. We waited 10 minutes for the seat while one of our the people in our group stood and talked to everyone. We then asked for another seat again and nothing came for another 5 minutes. We then just took a seat from another patrons table once they said they weren't using it.\n\n It turns out we were probably better off going to In and Out Burger. The food was \""ok\"" if you ignore the fact that they switched the spice on my dish and gave me 5 stars instead of one and my friend received no stars. After we covered my friends dish in hot sauce I asked for a replacement because they switched the spice. \n \n The waiter said he would, then asked if I would like some chicken dumplings while I waited and I said that would be great. I then didn't see the waiter for a bit. He finally came by and said he didn't bring my dumplings because I received tofu with my meal, he wasn't sure if I was a vegetarian. Except that I did say I would like chicken dumplings. After he walked away I then motioned for his attention and asked what else I could be compensated with since my meal was still not there and my party was almost done eating. He asked if I wanted a drink, I said yes then I waited 10 more minutes. I then asked the waiter where the drink was and he said he'd check on it. He found the drink at someone else's table. He then remade my drink and instead of a mojito I received an ice syrup drink that was disgusting.\n On top of all of this, my final meal was not all that great. \n\n\n Once we all put our cards in to pay for the waiter, I asked for change or to tell me if we were short cash. He already had an 18% gratuity on the bill. He then returned 5 minutes later and said we were square. I did the math and we were actually over $50 dollars of the owed bill. \n\n So, in the end here is what we experienced:\n\n1. Bad service\n2. Weak drinks\n3. Hard to find seating.\n4. Non-responsive staff\n5. Bland food\n6. Could not get the spice right\n7. Did not compensate for mistakes\n8. Overcharged and was dishonest"

0,"The only reason I knew about La Scala was because I saw them on restaurant.com.  After checking their rating on Yelp and seeing four stars I decided to give them a try.\n\nI'm starting to wonder if I ate at the same place...\n\nPretty much the only thing La Scala has going for it are its servers.  They were great.  Everything else?  Not so much.  I'll make this easy:\n\n-It appears the last remodeling was done around 1992.\n-The servers carry a giant easel with the specials written on it to your table.  It's awkward for both the server and the diner.\n-The Insalata della Casa was overdressed and appeared to have been dressed in the morning since the lettuce was completely wilted.\n-The Capellini al Pomodoro e Basilico had no basil, too many tomatoes, the tomatoes weren't fresh, and the dish as a whole had zero flavor.  Stay away from this.\n-The Ravioli di Ricotta e Spinaci alla Vodka were ok, but nothing out of this world- especially for $19.\n-Terribly overpriced for what you are getting.\n-The weird \""Hotel California\"" vibe coming from the regulars at the bar.\n\nThis is now the second restaurant I've been to that I think is a prime candidate for \""Restaurant Impossible.\""  I could just imagine Robert Irvine having a field day with the easel carrying the specials.\n\nI thought about two stars, but the service alone isn't enough to bring them up that far."
1,Peter in the pharmacy is amazing! I wish he could be my doctor. He's very knowledgable with prescriptions as well as over the counter medicines. I trust his opinion and I don't ever seem myself changing pharmacies. The wait here is never long and I never have any trouble getting generics or using coupons. I would give more stars if possible.
1,"This is a hidden gem in Circus Circus. Aged steak to perfection, you can see the entire preparation of the meal in the middle of the restaurant. Portions are pretty large so sharing may be an option for a couple. Fresh oysters are very tasty, large selection of wine at reasonable prices. The entire meal will not empty out the wallet, GREAT PLACE!"
0,"I recognize that after midnight might appear to be late, but c'mon, guys, this is Las Vegas!  After having dinner on the Las Vegas Strip and catching Jubilee at the Flamingo, my wife and I decided to cap off date night with an ice cream cone and hot apple pie from McDonalds on the way home.\n\nNo dice.  Despite the long line at the drive thru, we were informed that the ice cream machine was down.  No problem, we thought, just give us our hot apple pies and we'll take a latte to share.\n\nNow, the fact that the package the apple came in read \""Caution: HOT!\"" led me to believe that the apple pie would actually be, you know, hot.  My handy dandy insta-read thermometer informs me that the actual temperature of my \""HOT!\"" apple pie is actually 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  If I convert this temperature to Kelvin, THEN  it seems to be hot, but on both the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales this seems to be sorely lacking.\n\nC'mon guys.  It doesn't seem to much to ask that the \""HOT!\"" apples pies at least be warmer than body temperature.  Given the fact that the line for the drive-thru was at least 10 cars long when we arrived, I assume that there was enough turn-over in your food inventory to ensure that the products you were selling were fresh and hot.  I am disappointed with this experience!"
0,"I think I'm being a little more generous with my review than others, but I think that's more in the context of being with my friends and having a good time with them.  Nostalgia star +1\n\nThere's no denying that the neighborhood this place is in looks scary.  I've been to a lot of places that are iffy, and this is definitely one of those \""Walk from the car quickly, walk back to the car quickly\"" places.  The area is dark and scuggy (which is a cross between scrungy and ugly, for those not used to utilizing made-up words).  It also needs more lighting outside by a longshot, especially seeing other families and kids present.\n\nI went to see roller derby there, and while the event was fine, I think the girls deserve a better venue.  I understand roller derby may be considered a little underground or alternative, but this place looks like a high school gym.  Actually, I have seen nicer high school gyms, so what the Hell, hockey center?\n\nThe event seemed popular.  Why are there not enough seats for everyone?  Other people have hit the high/low points of the venue, but I have to agree: Better sound system, more accessible scoreboard so you don't have to crane your neck like Linda Blair in \""The Exorcist\"" to see it, a proper concession stand, better toilets, a paint job, fix the cracks, less scary toilets, etc.  One could probably draw in even more roller derby enthusiasts if they had a place to sit and didn't look so dirty.\n\nThe amusement to me was the church next door with the painted on building front.  That is some serious Wile E. Coyote style illusion without a doubt.  But I had trouble initially finding the hockey center because its signage is not very obvious.\n\nThe event was fun enough, my friends were great, but the place needs some major TLC."
1,"I love this place. Sometimes the pad thai is hit or miss though, hence why only 4 stars.\n\nI love the lunch specials: soup, salad, egg roll, and dish for $8.25? Perfect deal. Soup is wonderful, as is the egg roll! I don't eat salad but I'm sure it's great too!"
0,"Absolutely terrible place to be for the UFC fights. I took my fianc\u00e9 there on a Saturday night for UFC Jones vs Evans and we were so disappointed. First you pay a cover charge, which is no biggie, but if I pay a cover charge, I want more than 1/3 of the TVs to be on the fights. Ridiculous. The waitress was terrible. She was constantly forgetting things and treating us like nothing. The food. The food was unbelievably bad. Even for a bar, that was nasty. I asked for a cheeseburger medium well and got a burnt up patty with NO cheese. This place was the biggest waste of money. With what we spent here we could have ordered at home. Please, do not go here to watch UFC. They may be semi decent any other day, but for UFC nights, absolute garbage!!"
1,Good place to go if you like ramen offered in places like NYC. The broth is good but the noodles could be better. I would highly recommend the bacon wrapped enoki (mushroom) as an appetizer. I'm glad to see a place like this open up in Charlotte.
1,"===\n4/19/2012 Update\n===\n\nUpdated top flavor list:\n\n1. Pecan - superbly roasted pecans in a milky, creamy paleta; this is the best one; we get it every time, in addition to trying new flavors\n2. Pineapple - fresh, sweet, explosive flavor with real chunks of pineapple\n3. Banana - fresh, sweet flavor with real chunks of banana\n4. Pear Cranberry - light pear flavor with tart whole fresh cranberries\n5. Raspberry Yogurt - slightly tart raspberry layer atop a very sweet raspberry yogurt layer\n6. Strawberry and Cream - sweet fresh strawberry with strong cream flavor\n7. Pineapple Chili - Like pineapple, but with a hint of spicy pepper\n8. Lemon Drop - extremely tart, with sugar on the outside; not for everyone, but great if you like a sour snack\n9. Pasa - amaretto almond base with especially tasty homemade dried grape raisins   \n10. Blackberry Lavender - fresh fruit taste with strong lavender flavor\n11. Banana with Caramel and Rum - much sweeter than the regular banana with hints of caramel and rum\n12. Mexican Hot Chocolate - spicy chocolate flavor with some cinnamon\n13. Rice Pudding - the cinnamon is strong, so good if that is your flavor\n14. Saint Patrick - this was a special flavor introduced around St. Patrick's day; while the kiwi chunks were excellent, the major flavor was melon, which I am not a fan of; if you like melon, this would be a very good choice\n\nAnother great option is the aquitas drink. The lime and raspberry flavor is an excellent mixture of seltzer limeade and fresh raspberry. It really packs a tart punch and strong flavors.\n\nSee my original review for details on the overall experience."
1,"Had a quick lunch yesterday and was pleasantly surprised by how good the cantina fish taco's were, they were tiny (which is how I like to eat) and full of flavor. Good service and nice atmosphere. Will definitely be returning for lunch more often."
1,"Thought we would have to wait considering it was NYE and lunch time, but surprisingly the restaurant was bigger than expected and we were seated for 8 right away.  The server came over and took our drink orders and told us the specials right away.\n\nTo start we ordered the pork sliders and pork belly buns.. Someone loves pork!  They were both pretty good.  The pork sliders had an Asian twist with cilantro and peanut sauce.  It was a good combination.  The pork belly buns were good and tasty, but a little too fatty for my tasting.  I took a bite and it was all fat. No meat at all.  It was seasoned well, but I didn't like the fat texture.  Overall the appetizers were good.  We also ordered amazing onion rings that were stacked really high.  They were so crispy and so good. \n\nI ordered the rising sun burger cooked medium.  It was delicious and I think I could've eaten it all myself, but I shared it.  It came with steak fried which were thick but crispy.  \n\nOther people ordered a salad which looked good, but didn't taste good.  (But who orders a salad at a burger joint?) It was a waste if money because it costs doubled for the salad compared to my burger.  I'm sure they will never order a salad at a burger joint ever again. \n\nService was good and they gave us popcorn as he delivered everyone water.  I wanted to ask when the movie started.  The popcorn was good.  \n\nSome people in my group didn't like it, but i didn't order a salad at a burger joint so I really liked my burger.  Will definitely go back to try a shake with my burger."
1,"First time here won't b my last . Thanks to the yelp community , I found this place .\n     The best part is it's in my hood. I don't think I would have tried it on my own.\n      We had a large pizza with meatballs, mushrooms and ricotta cheese . All the ingredients tasted fresh, the crust was very good , thin crisp and had a nice chew.  We also had the chix wings , I don't usually order chix wings at a pizza place , but all the positve reviews on these wings i had to try them . The wings are very good and don't need no sauce .\n      I also ordered the italian sub , all I can say is wow lots of meat( salami , capicola.)  The owner is very friendly and proud of his food as he should be."
0,"I went on a wing night (Wednesdays). They have the best jumbo wings! The sauces could be better though. However, the staff are terrible. All of them stood around on their cell phones and looked uninterested in servicing customers, and there weren't many of us here. Kylee was our server and we only saw her twice. Once to take our order and then to drop the check. A cook actually brought us our food!!! I observed her on her cell phone, and beer sampling sitting on the back bar top (health code violation btw) the rest of the time. No visible manager in sight. If you want to try the wings I would recommend going to a different location, I usually go to the one in Verona, service is much better there."
0,"Absolutely the worst service I've ever experienced in my life. Food was cold by the time it arrived. This place used to be good too. Ive never been to a restaurant that was basically empty at 730 pm, and told by the staff  \""its a 45 min wait. were running behind\"" Horrible experience."
0,"I love a good burger but this place is a huge disappointment. Your easily spending $25 for a burger, fries, and one drink. For that price I would expect a burger that would knock my socks off."
1,"It's Costco. Can't go wrong. Wonderful employees and great deals all around. Also, the food court is an amazing place to sit down and have a delicious, cheap hot-dog."
1,So delicious. Lemon custard with cold fudge is a favorite!
0,"I surmised two things from my visit to Thai Cuisine:\n\na) the competition among thai restaurants must not be very stiff in this town\n\nb) yinzers wouldn't know good thai food if it flew into their open mouths\n\nThis place was horrible. My fried trout was just a battered butterflied fish not much different from what you'd find at a church fish-fry. Insipid, over-battered and generally unpleasant. My dining partner's masaman curry was so sickly sweet it tasted like melted coconut ice cream. Surprisingly, the joint was slammed. \n\nOn the bright side, service was very fast. On the downside, our waitress was definitely stressed out and cranky possibly from waiting on the 14-top of inebriated co-eds across the room from us.\n\nThe takeaway: If you're from Pittsburgh, you'll probably love this place -- it was packed with your kinsmen when I was there. But if you've enjoyed quality thai food in any large coastal metropolis, steer clear.\n\np.s. food was needlessly pricey given the poor quality."
0,My wife got a bannana mocha and she really didnt like it but she did finish it over the 5 hour drive home.
1,Who doesn't love Costco? Love buying things in bulk!!! & don't forget the free samples! \nEmployees are always so friendly & smiling. Probably because they have great insurance & make more money than Sam's Club/Walmart ;) lol \nBest thing about this location is the Self Checkout. Lines at Costco can get ridiculously long so self check out helps a lot. Especially when you don't have as many items as the others who seem to be stocking up for a zombie apocalypse. \n\nPS; don't forget to get a churro & a berry smoothie on your way out. YUM!!!
1,"Not sure how Dr. O has gone unrated on yelp all this time. I'm a picky guy about dentists but came to Dr. O for whitening, a crown, and ended up there for 5 years now, I even see him for my cleanings when I'm in town even since I moved. I pay cash and his prices are great and doesn't offer any unnecessary work or xrays. He and his staff have decades of experience and their work is fast and as pleasant as going to the dentist gets.\n\nAnd the best part is they're always on time and never overbook, the most I've waited in 15 or so visits is about 5 minutes"
1,Holy S*** where do i start this place is AMAZING!!!!!  this is probably one of the best restaurants in pittsburgh. My boyfriend i went there in March. The service was amazing. The restaurant is HUGE. The decor is amazing and very welcoming they have a huge selection of tables. During the summer they open the patio. \nI had the vegetarian chefs tasting menu and every bite blew my mind. all the vegetables are grown locally and sustainably. There were 4 courses the chef sent over a complimentary salad that was yummy. i had the beets salad with pumpkin seeds for my first course \n i had the risotto for my main course and dessert was my favorite. The entire night was one food orgasm after another. The service here was to die for and i would give this place 10 stars if i could
0,"Verdict: Disappointing. \n\nMy lady and I ate here last year and without question, it tasted like a whole different place then--in a good way. \n\nToday, the garlic fries came out cold, slightly stale and crunchy. \n\nMy single pastrami burger was overly salty and I'm sure the burger patty was frozen, not fresh--which gave it a bland flavor on top of being dry. \n\nMy lady got the Philly cheesesteak and that wasn't too bad, it tasted as it should have, but could have been more hot when it came out. Definitely the better choice between the two of us though. \n\nNo idea what happened over the course of a year, but for sure--the quality has gone with the passing of 2013."

0,This place screwed my friend Marlena. She paid $59.99 for a service call and they said they would be back the next day and they weren't. She continues to try and call them to no avail. Now she is sitting with no dryer and out of $60!
0,"Like my first drunk sex experience- forgettable! This was public highschool cafeteria-grade ungoodness. \n\nThe only reason they got a second star was that the service was excellent (Cindy, originally from Montibello, CA, was an absolute darling), and they use real maple syrup for the waffles. \n\nEverything else....... prefer to pass. \n\nMeh to the max."
1,"First of all, this place is right on the canal (the only place to be so) and therefore that alone earns it several of its stars. I mean, when you have something as special and romantic as a Venice canal with gondolas passing by every 15mnts and gondoliers serenading their guests, why wouldn't you take full advantage of it!! \n\nThe place itself was very vegetarian-friendly, albeit relied heavily on mushrooms (which I'm allergic to). The only downside of this place was that they were unwilling to do any substitutions at all, which means for a mushroom-allergic person such as myself, there weren't really that many vegetarian options left. We tried the guac-chips and fondido as well as sides of beans and cilantro rice."
1,"Well I have just completed the purchase of a bike from Red Rock Harley so my experience is complete!  I have had my bikes serviced there for the past 5 years and Bernie is \""hands-down\"" the best service tech I have ever encountered!  On the retail side, I usually get Jill to help me and she is fantastic. On the parts side Josh is always quick to give me a smile and say \""good to see you again\"".  A couple of weeks ago I bought the new CVO Roadglide from Lawrence and he has been very accomodating and helpful.  He even gave me a ride home after trading in my Roadking!  \n\nI have been to a lot of HD Dealers all over the US and Canada and I have to say, this is one of the best!  The always have a large selection of bikes, parts, and retail.  The people are VERY friendly (if your friendly to them) and eager to help.  I haven't personally met anyone in the back but my service has always been great and they always do a great job cleaning my bike when I pick it up!  \n\nI don't usually write reviews because I'm a shitty typer but this is a great Dealership with good people who are eager to do a good job.  If you're shopping around definetly check them out!"
0,"Sadly, I think the last time I dined here was my last.  I always feel gross after ingesting items off of their soy-filled menu. So, I tried a salad and was utterly disappointed.  When it comes down to it, I'd rather spend my money on real food, not fake meat and fake cheese and fake this and that.  \n\nKeep it real...er...well, you just keep it."
1,"I've been coming here since this place opened. I most recently ate here 4 days ago. \n\nI have tried plenty of things on the menu. Let the list begin.\n\n-Beef Brisket- Very tender great smokey flavor. \n-Baby Back Ribs- Served with a dry rub full of flavor and pulls right off the bone.\n-Pulled Pork Sandwich- Piled high on a Huge bun topped with coleslaw, served with fries and 1 rib. $6.25 ( Killer Deal ) I personally love there pulled pork sauce. I don't know how to describe it except for I would drink it with a straw.\n-Whole Rotisserie Chicken- I love the rub. Very moist and tender even the white meat. I of course top it with the pulled pork sauce. \n-Homemade Chili w/ Brisket- The first couple times I had it I liked it better. The last time I had it, it was all meat no beans and kinda greasy. I will give it another try though.\n-Corn Bread w/ cinnamon honey butter-WOW that's it. \n-Red Velvet Cake- Can I get another.... WOW!!!!!!\n\nI have not tried the Catfish yet but I will update when I do. Please check this place out...support local BBQ."
0,"I don't really understand the hype over Olimpico.  It's right across the street from me and by far the closest caf\u00e9 to me, but I always find myself going farther afield.  The coffee is okay, I suppose, but there's coffee that's just as good to be had elsewhere on St-Viateur and especially one block up on Bernard.\n\nApart from the decent coffee, Olimpico is a strange, disharmonious, and unfortunate blend of the worst aspects of a cafe and a sports bar.  The food is at best underwhelming (with some options, such as the pre-packaged, days-old croissants, being totally off the radar of acceptability), so there's nothing to complement the decent coffee.  There are plenty of people who go there to chat and/or read, and the patio is nice enough on a sunny day, though the clash between this crowd and the sports-bar contingent is palpable and insufficiently tempered by Olimpico's lack of a liquor licence (which, to me, makes it the worst possible place to watch a sports game)."

0,"This store has some problems.   The garden section is nice in the spring and well staffed to my taste.   But the main hardware section is sort of \""not fun\"" to shop.   Can't put my finger on why but it is sort of uninviting.   I have had poor service here a number of times.  Once the returns/assistance person was arguing with her supervisor I assume about working another shift and made me wait long enough that I decided to leave.  Then to check out you have a bit of a walk.  The parking lot is one of the worst in Madison.  Terrible ease of entry and exit.  They have good deals at times.  Mixed bag.\nPoor customer response.  I protested their support for Walker and received a non-relevant response. This puts them down one more star."
0,"Couldn't have experience worse customer service. Any martial art or self-defense system should have humility and a focus on people and passion for learning & teaching at heart. Instead, after walking in hoping to continue to pick up where my previous training in grad-school left off, I was told that they weren't \""interested\"" once they found out I am a strength & conditioning coach. I simply told the woman, that I am there to learn, not to coach & she then stated that they don't want people \""stealing their methods\"" as if I was going to teach the baseball, football and high-school athletes I worked with Krav Maga at a performance training facility focused on speed, power and agility.\n\nTwo more co-workers went in, including my girlfriend and it was the same song but different verse. Disappointed that there are \""teachers\"" out there that are so self conscious that they think not opening their doors to everyone willing to learn will somehow preserve and grow their business.\n\nSide note* their pricing is also ridiculous. Locked in contracts that are clearly focused on money and forced retention."
0,"I heard the food was awesome, a point that was confirmed by a older gentleman just finishing his breakfast. He warned that the service would be slow, but it would be worth the wait. I had nowhere to be for hours and looked forward to a lazy morning. \n\nThen the proprietor emerged from the kitchen, a stern-looking fellow with thick white hair and a mustache. He sized me up and asked, \""Yeah, can I help you?\""\n\nI knew from reading other reviews of this joint that I was in for something strange. I wanted to experience this. \n\nI said, \""I'm just one. Can I sit anywhere?\""  \n\nHis response? \""I'm alone here. You better go someplace else.\""\n\nI smiled. I wanted to laugh, but I feared he might not react kindly to that. So I left and went to Hanlon's down the street.  I'll try again next time. Getting kicked out is half the fun."
0,"Yahhhhh I was here a couple of years ago and was appalled by the hotel.\n\nWell, to start off with, I was using the hotel to just store my bags for the day until I had to catch my red eye flight and didnt want to spend a good chunk of my money on The Hotel at Mandalay bay just for 6 more hours.\nSo I just decided to rent out a room at Excalibur.\n\nMy gawd.. it was nutz.  The check in line was like the lotto line.  The rooms were okay size but everything in it was just basic.  The beds were sinking in.  There was a humid smell in the room which wouldnt go away and I think the AC made it worse.  \n\nBut in terms of cleanliness, it was okay.  I didnt see anything that was gross or dirty."
1,Really cozy pub for a nice pint. Alot of great history in this pub. When I visit it I make sure give a toast to the lads whose pictures are on the wall's.
1,"We walked into Halo (piercing shop downtown) and they handed us some pamphlets...\nOne of them was a map with all the cool/hip spots downtown and we realized we hadn't been to many of them. So we Decided to go to all of the ones listed and cross em out.\nAnd, this was our first stop. \n\nI'm gonna start off by saying how much i like the vibe of this place, especially the outside seating on a sunny day.\nThe food was so yummy.\nAnd, I normally don't like going to eat Mexican food other than my own Mom's kitchen because I am Hispanic and extremely picky.\n\nI really love their carne tacos and quesadillas..\nTheir beans(lard free) are my favorite. \nThe horchata is not that powdery crap.\nIt's home made. \nI really do love this place.\nI've been here a few times already and also brought my parents who loved the place as well.\n\nThe only thing I will say is that -if you want to get completely full, it is a bit pricey.\n\nI tend to crave this food a lot, and I'm glad I finally found a lil taco shop that met my standards.\n\n\nWay to go America!"
1,"I had a horrible experience three weeks ago in this restaurant. When I called the manager, she apologized and insisted that the waitress in question would receive more training. Upon our return last weekend (Hey, I can't help it...I love the food), the manager came by to make sure everything was okay at least 4 times during the meal. It was completely unexpected, but she gave us a discount on our meal, and offered us free dessert. I was simply happy with the apology, but Maria went out of her way to make sure that we had a good dining experience that night. (For the record, we had our usual fantastic service from our waiter). Great people. Will definitely return."
1,Great food! Good prices!
1,Best mex in Scottsdale. Super cute and trendy. Best margs and salsa in town. Get the shrimp taco or Courtney's burrito!
0,"The Feast Buffet at GVR is always clean and inviting. Service is acceptable and at lunch you can get a fresh rubin or grilled ham & cheese at the teppan station. The selection is decent and they have spamoni for desert. If you like deals get a players club card and you can eat breakfast for $5.\n\nThat said, sometimes the line seems to take forever to move. If you do a teppanyaki they only use ground meat (not good.) I am yet to see a crab leg at the place. They also kick you out between meals. We met for a business lunch and just hung around the table reviewing paperwork (not even drinking soft drinks.) The place was mostly deserted and they came over and told us we had to leave in 5 min. Ok, not eating, not drinking, not preventing anyone else from having a table. We left. I guess they were worried we would pay for lunch and get dinner....gasp! wait, no crab legs, yeah we were not waiting for dinner service. \n\nFor the price it is just okay, we usually just go over to Sunset Station or the Rio."
1,"Went back again. Sat at the bar with a friend from Long Island, NY. We had a sensational dinner. Not good, but great. It's basic Italian food. Wine is reasonably priced. Same wine across the street at the Wynn is literally double per bottle."
1,"To compensate us for the water being off, a nice front desk clerk gave me $30 credit and reminded me that the package I bought already had $30 on it, so we had free lunch and i got souvenirs to take home; one clerk in a gift shop misunderstood what I was trying to buy and overcharged me by $41, and the refund was not in the yet when I checked out, and i was going to have to pay for it, but I got a clerk from the Gift Shop to straighten it out.  I would come back again, for sure."
0,I have been here several times because it is a favorite go to place at my company due to its proximity.\n\nThey are open for breakfast and lunch only. The lunch food for me has been consistently terrible. \n\nI cannot recommend it for lunch.
0,"I love the food, but the service is so rude, (excluding the main manager, he's awesome.) My grandma doesn't speak English well and the waitresses completely talked down to her like she was a child. She ordered wings plain for her appetizer combo and they only gave her wings; they refused to cooperate and only continued to demean her. I usually love this place, but don't be mean to my little grandma! Along with that, the waitresses began to purposely ignore me when I tried to order anything extra. Not coming back for a while..."
1,"One Stop Auto is the only repair shop I will ever use! They have proven to me that they are the most honest and consistently knowledgable mechanics I have ever dealt with. When a dealership told me I would have to replace my AC compressor for $800 I took it to One Stop where they found a small leak, plugged it and recharged my system for under $50! They bend over backwards to fix my problem the first time and go the extra mile to get my car repaired and back to me in the time and at the price quoted! I have never received the kind of service and concern from a service provider like I have from One Stop! They have gained a customer for life!"
1,"Delicious! Went for lunch and they had an awesome lunch special; 2 empanadas, cabbage salad, rice and beans.  The service was very welcoming, I felt like I walked into a friends home, it was very clean, and had 2 large screen TV's. The food was absolutely delicious. We got 4 different empanadas ALL were yummy!!!  We will be back and I highly suggest your check it out too."
0,"The only reason we chose to eat here was because my parents and I stayed at the Mirage and this is the closest buffet.... but there's almost no reason for me to come back =(\n\n- mediocre decor and hype\n- stained containers and cutlery\n- ridiculously salty crab legs\n- poor selection of dessert that didn't look good to me, if u are a  dessert person, go elsewhere!!\n- food from different parts of the world were served in different sessions, but they were very spread out, and it almost took me a minute to walk from the Italian session to the Japanese session! \n\n+ the only plus was that their prime rib was actually pretty good.\n\nI didn't expect a lot, but for $25.95, I guess I expected it to be okay. Still, I was disappointed. We went to Paris for their lunch buffet the day after, and I felt way happier and more satisfied for just $17.99!!"
0,"Not a good experience here today! I went in to return some items and the woman helping me was somewhat rude and not helpful. Usually when I go in I'm in and out and have no issues. This woman was being very technical saying that the skew number on the receipt had to match the item exactly, even though it was the same item. For example, I returned a creme brulee set and the skew number on the receipt ended in 4686 but on the item it was 4687. She would not allow me to return the item even though it showed I bought a creme brulee set. I think she figured that I would just take the items back and not worry about the returns. In the long run it wound up making more work for herself because she had to do some of the returns over 2 or 3 times. Maybe she was mad because I had 8 different returns? I don't know. If you hate your job that much to where you take it out on customers then get a new job! It makes me mad because even though I was returning about $200 worth of merchandise I spend well over $1,000 there this holiday season. I could easily take my business to TJ Maxx or Marshalls. They charge a little more but at least I wouldn't have to deal with snippy little brats. \n\nAt the end of the transaction I thanked her and she ignored me and went onto helping the next customer. Sorry I made you do your job. \n\nI will say that this is probably a one off situation. Usually the people that work there are really nice. I wish they would permanently hire some of their holiday helpers because they were seriously the nicest and most helpful."
0,"This company is Awful! We have tried several months for Larry Smith to return our calls. He is evidently the manager, and seems to never be available , or doesn't know how to use his phone. We paid several thousand dollars for a transfer of our timeshare which they never completed. Never use this company!"
0,"If had the chance to stay in your car or Hard Rock Hotel stay in your car.  Wifi didn't work, safe didn't work, front disk and \nManager  extremely unprofessional.  When I called to complain she was trying to make a believe that with removing resort fee everything will be Better. I won't be back to this establishment ever again.  Not even for free."
1,"Four adults and two children today for lunch.  Have nothing to complain about, as service was great and our food just about perfect for what we ordered.  Kids meals of corn dogs, and macaroni & cheese.  YUM!  Two chicken pot pies (one had the chicken a little too well done which left it sort of tough), the other one, perfect.  I had a cup of French Onion Soup and an artichoke.  Seems I can't get past their grilled artichokes whenever we eat here.  Delicious!  In fact that is one of the main reasons I love to eat here.  As stated before, service was very good with everyone being so attentive and we will definitely be back!"
1,"The Griddle stays busy and there's a reason for that...it's good! Over the summer this became a bit of a ritual for my boyfriend and I. We became Griddle experts. \n\nThe skillets here are huge and tasty but arrive starving! My favorite is the philly cheese one, yum. I usually stick to the canadian bacon and eggs, simple but great every time. The boyfriend swears the biscuits and gravy are the best he's ever had, so take his word for it. The french toast is picture perfect too.\n\nThe coffee isn't quite strong enough for my taste, but that's just me. \nA cool part about coming here on Sundays is the farmers market is right in the same parking lot, makes for a great morning meal then a walk around. Sometimes the wait is about 15-20 mins but even on a busy day I don't think I've waited longer than that. They offer outdoor seating as well if you want to bring your canine companion along."
1,"I came to Satara with low expectations because it's in the middle of a lot of crappy chain restaurants, and it's in Peoria.  Never judge a book by what suburb it's located in, or how close it might be to the Cheesecake Factory.  \n\nThis is the second-best Thai food I've had, and because my #1 is so good, I almost never eat at Thai restaurants anymore because I'm so consistently disappointed.  Satara really raises the bar, and in so many ways.  A Thai restaurant with a great wine list?  Fantastic, and why not?  And when I say second-best, it's like saying Kobe Bryant is the second-best basketball player ever, not a knock on the restaurant.  I look forward to many extraordinary visits to Satara."
0,"Just watched new staff members put over 15 pairs of loaner skates away without disinfecting them. My daughter's been figure skating here for over a year.  Never had any issues until new ownership took over. The place is going downhill and needs a lot of revamping. New owner stopped free skate before practice,  lost my payment and places the figure skaters on the south pole ring (which is freezing has no arcade game or snack bar/tv to entertain restless siblings) while the north pole ring is completely vacant. Hopefully this is just some growing pain and will improve with time. Until then, my daughter will be finding another hobby."
0,Never been there ... scared away by the name. \n\nBut I read an article that it had closed Sat. 4-11-09 so I wanted to verify that was the case so I can add it to my list of  closed businesses and things that aren't there anymore.\n\nhttp://thedish.freedomblogging.com/2009/04/09/is-better-than-sex-cake-cafe-closing-saturday/6115/\n\nIndeed it was closed. Sign says closed for the season until Oct. but the article above indicates it may be longer than that.
0,"So let's get this out of the way up front: The food here's pretty good. There I said it. I always enjoy the food, there's not been one thing there that I've eaten that I didn't like. That being said, food isn't going to make me return to a place to eat. We usually get takeout from CB because their service flat out sucks. My wife made me go with her this past weekend, because I've been making her get takeout form Hula Modern Tiki the past few times (Hula's great). So against my will, and because it was on the eve of Valentine's day, I decided to cave against my better judgement. I should be totally ticked, but because they didn't fail my expectations and screwed up my meal/deliviered craptacular service, wifey won't be making me go again. Win, I think.  I always make it a point to order the dinner special from places with the idea that the chefs are sick and tired of cooking the same stuff on the menu, and will be invigorated at cooking something new and exciting. This particular night, I opted for the Miso Marinated Sea Bass. Sounds great, right? I'll never know.....the server never brought it to me. Appetizer arrived, wife's meal arrived, daughter's bowl of steamed rice arrived, beer arrived, sake arrived, check arrived. Not in that order, but you get my drift. So my meal consisted of some of my wife's sushi, some of my daughter's steamed rice, some of the appetizer, beer, sake and table bread. Happy Valentines to you Cherry Blossom!  If anybody's thinking of checking this place out, get takeout. The food's good, but I can get better service at QT. (Yes, the gas station)"
0,Pizza ok on it's own nothing great . Definitely not worth the restaurant price.  definitely not like pizzeria UNO in Chicago. Are they even related   or are they just using their name and trademark.
1,"I love this trader joe! First, all trader joes are amazing with their prices. $3 for an amazing Greek salad?...SOLD! This one however is always clean and has exceptionality amazing staff who are always happy and in a good moods, and who are always willing to help!"
0,"Contrary to a lot of Yelper's reviews, I wasn't that impressed with Blue Dust. It's a hole in the wall with a fantastic beer selection. \n\nIt's off the beaten path of the waterfront, located across the tracks towards Eighth Ave. next to a tattoo parlor on Amity Street. \n\nI'd heard a lot about this place as well as read just about every review on Yelp and newspaper reviews. I wasn't sure what to expect, but a dark, dank, Burgh bar wasn't it. \n\nI was highly impressed with the bar, any brand of vodka, flavored, proof, etc, bacon bourbon, and a nice selection of beers. I had a black IPA, which was awesome with the Spicy China Doll (a thick pasty bean dip that could have used a bit of salt) served with very good tortilla chips that's weren't a bit greasy. For Dinner I had a portobello wrap, it was nice and meaty but lacked basic salt and pepper seasoning.  Neither the app or wrap really stood out in my mind. \n\nIf this was the last restaurant on earth, I'd come back, by then maybe they'll know how to properly season food before being consumed by their customers."
1,"Delicious, simple meal; attentive waitstaff; cool 1930s-esque ambiance.  \n\nI had the sauteed duck confit with salad, and my boyfriend had the homemade raviolis.  The duck confit salad was fresh, delicious, and plenty for an entree.  Greens, sauteed green beans, radishes, bits of crunchy ham or canadian bacon, mini croutons, and a light vinaigrette.  I've been craving it ever since, and will probably attempt to recreate it soon, but I'm sure it won't live up to my memory.  The ravioli were light and tasty, filled with a mixture of pork and beef, I think, and surrounded in what looked and tasted like a beef or pork broth of some sort. We finished up with the orange creme caramel.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  \n\nPlus, they bring a pickle jar to your table after you order.  Blissful!"
1,"Today, I called and spoke with Hamid, and to my surprise he was totally unaware of the poor customer service that his customers had been receiving. He stated that he was not given my messages and had other complaints regarding the customer service. I believe in fairness and second chances, I do believe that Hamid is a good and honest person to do business with and value his customers. I respectfully recommend Busy Buggy, because the quality of his work and Zip Zap Auto was done right and he has released the infected employees that was ruining business for him. He's all hands on now and you will be dealing with him directly.\n\nI totally respect and appreciate a business when they value me as a customer.\n\nThank you."
0,"I know tea..I have been drinking tea for the last 45 years all over the world. I have tried 4 different teas here and they were way way below average with unpleasant after taste. You are better off with starbuck or coffee bean tea. Souvia Tea would be my last choice for \""good tea\"". Very very disappointed. still searching for the \""best tea\""."
0,"We ate at Carrabba's in Chandler last night. It was okay, but I have had better. The service left a lot to be desired. The server was pleasant enough, but neglected to advise me that they do not have green peppers to put on my pizza. The entire table heard me, so when my pizza came out it was covered with pepperocini. I sent it back, and they remade it, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended). One can get much better pizza and service at Nello's a few miles away, or Humble Pie. It will be a long time before I go to Carrabba's again."
1,"Ok, maybe I was hungry and swayed by the easy parking, great modern design, nice outdoor eating space, friendly staff and good food. But, who wouldn't give this a 5. What a great way to have a breakfast spot. Walk up to the counter, order, get your own coffee, drinks, condiments, etc, and choose your seat. If your coffee gets low, you just get it. Need more water? It's all right there. How many times at a regular restaurant have you said that you wished you could just refill your own drink yourself, because you would not have to wait? Probably many times or you just got upset. Here you go. \n\nThis place has great modern decor with nice colors and accents. I noticed it right away when we walked in. Not what you would expect from the outside, a pleasant surprise. \n\nThere are menus on the wall and menus up above and printed menus if you want something you can hold to read and choose your fare. We opted for a veggie scramble with zucchini, yellow squash, and hold the onions for me, a Santa Fe Benedict (thanks to all the fantastic yelp reviews) and two coffees. We signed up for a frequent visitor card and even got an extra 10% off. Woohoo, always welcomed. It came to just $20 for the two of us.\n\nWe chose our seats, near a power outlet so that I could charge my phone, and got comfortable. I made a trip to the restroom to find a very upscale modern bathroom that I was quite impressed by. Not necessarily fitting of a breakfast spot, but totally appropriate with all the other modern decor. \n\nOur breakfast seemed to take a little while, but looked great when it arrived. The quantity of food seemed pretty good for the price and everything looked and tasted very fresh. I was very pleased with my choice of veggie scramble and thoroughly enjoyed it. SG loved his benedict and I even got to sample it. Not being a poached egg fan, I was skeptical, but I got very little yolk in my taste. The sauce was delicious, I definitely understand all the yelp. Both of us enjoyed our coffees and had no problem getting up to refill. Especially since we do not really like our coffees refilled mid cup, it just messes up the chemistry.\n\nThis place is a little tucked away from the freeway and not super convenient to drive to when you are just in town visiting, but its only just under 10 minutes detour for a fantastic breakfast. Well worth it. We will likely be back."
1,"As far as bowling alleys go, it's a pretty average looking place. They do have a pretty cool cafe with pool tables and TV's as well as a snack bar. What I do like about this place is it's clean and staff are very friendly. I come here for my boyfriend's bowling league and find it comfortable to hang out.I also do enjoy the fact there's no smoking inside. If you're looking for a good place to bowl, I'd go here!"
1,"What a beautiful modern hotel.  Currently the \""it\"" spot for all sorts of action.  I enjoy the fresh feel and lively atmosphere this hotel offers.  Their casino you will encounter on street level.  As you ascend to each of the three floors, you will encounter a slurry of restaurants, lounges, bars, clubs and loads of draping chandeliers.  Take your pick, there's bound to be something for everyone.\n\nI'm a sucker for historical facts, so according to my research, The Cosmopolitan's design team was led by Friedmutter Group as executive architect, with Arquitectonica as the design architect for the building's themed exterior. The building was engineered by DeSimone Consulting Engineers. The Interior design team includes the Friedmutter Group, The Rockwell Group, Jeffrey Beers, Adam Tihany, and Bentel & Bentel.\n\nAlthough I've never experienced it, the Marquee Night/Day club is here and quite the popular draw with the Kardashian and Hilton wannabes.  The bars here were all \u00fcber crowded; perfect for those that need to feel they're at the hottest spot on the Strip.  This is it!\n\n#Yelp 365:  040/365"
1,"Fogo Vs. The guys from Texas?  I say its a close tie.  They both serve very similar heavenly cuts of meat.  They both offer a diverse salad bar and drink menu.  The price for lunch and dinner is slightly different, give or take a couple bucks.  Both places have exceptional customer service.  1 point for Fogo because they serve better tasting and cheesier cheese  bread.  1 point for Texas for their Lobster Bisque.  If I were to choose between the two, I guess I would say whoever thinks of offering free back rubs by beautiful brazilian woman first!  ...On second thought, we were offered free flan for dessert by our waiter.. Good enough!"
0,"Went there recently. Bar service was slow. Food was excellent. Had the Turkey, Swiss, and Mushroom sandwich and La Palloma Margarita. I live in the area, work in the same industry.\n\nDuring the course of my visit there, There was a hockey game on (Canucks vs. Predators) Of all the 40 T.V's there, there were only 2 T.V's that had this game on. (Granted hockey isn't big in AZ) 3 mins left in the third period, they changed it to a DBacks game... WHA??? \n\nAt this point EVERY T.V. had on a basketball, or the diamondbacks game on... I asked why they changed it, and the bartender said, \""They are watching it down there.\"" (pointing to a couple opposite end who got there after me.) So, Stanley cup playoffs is less important than a beginning of the season baseball game? HA!\n\nI brought a lot of friends, and some family. I was taking care of the bartenders with great tips all night long, and that was my thanks?\n\nI moved to another bar inside, where there was no bartender, away from my sister, brother in law, room-mate, his girlfriend, my best friend from high school, and some buddies in town to finish this game that now was pushed into overtime. (which i obviously missed.) I expressed my concerns and how I wasn't feeling welcome anymore. No one really cared, except for one bartender Jenna. she was cool about it. Fixed the situation and helped as much as she could. \n\nAs I was getting settled in to the bar opposite of everything, the bartender from the other bar that I was at moments prior, came by and handed me my second drink without me even asking for one. I thought, cool, they know they messed up, a free drink? Sure it's not a big deal. After she handed it to me she asked, \""Want this on a tab or still pay cash?\""\n\nSeriously?\n\nI'll take my family, friends, and our money somewhere else.\n\n And we did."
0,"While visiting Vegas, my friend and I looked to see what's around on Yelp. This place was listed and so we decided to check it out.\n\nWe inputted the address into our phone GPS and it led us to a corner strip mall.  After looking, we see that it is tucked away into the corner.\n\nWe noticed that there were only a few cars parked around it. Granted, it was a Tuesday evening.  My friend and I debate if we want to still check it out.  After a few minutes, we decide to go check it out and if we didn't care for it, we would just leave.\n\nWe walk in and the place was dead.  Just as we were about to walk out, the bartender waved to us and said \""Hello\"". At that moment,  we felt like we should at least maybe stay for a bit.  Including us, there were a total of seven people ... and that was including the bartender.\n\nThe bartender was really nice.  He even bought the drinks my friend and I were having, which was a just a simple water and sparkling water. ha ha.  With it being karaoke night, two people were taking turns singing.  Often times it made for the conversation my friend and the bartender hard to understand.  \n\nAfter about 30 - 45 minutes, we decided to head out and check out a few other places. If it weren't for the friendly bartender, we wouldn't have stayed as long as we did."
1,"My 500th review.... WOW. FIVE HUNNIDD. 5 hundred ones.\n\nOn my 2nd trip back to Vegas in as many weeks, I just had to have more of Bachi Burger. I met a grade school classmate who lives in town at the original location on Windmill. It was my first time at this location. It was just a little after 11am on a Friday. I had just landed at McCarran. From the airport, I got my rental car and drove the short distance to Bachi. I was seated right away being that they just opened. I was seated towards the back by the window on the way to the restrooms but still had full view of  the entire restaurant. \n\nWaited a little while for my friend as she was in transit but stuck in traffic. The waiter we had made sure to check on me a couple of times and I started off with the oxtail cheese fries. It was served just in time as my friend sat down. Great timing!.. The oxtail chili cheese fries were as good as I remember. Perfectly crisp fries, tender strips of oxtail strewn about amongst cheese, chili (with beans), jalapeno slices & cilantro. Oh and dont forget the fried egg on top... Good stuff.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the pork belly steamed buns (3 pieces) instead of a burger. It's just so tasty and perfect in its bite sized form. The soft & delicious still warm steamed bun, cradling the slightly crisp on the edges but buttery soft pork belly with hoisin sauce, sliced hard boiled egg & cilantro (i dont even like cilantro!) combination is so damn good. Its one of my most favorite cravings these days. Thankfully the Sawtelle location opened the same exact day I was at the OG location. I'm definitely going there to get my fix and to support my friend's cousin who is a line cook there. \n\nMy friend ordered the Miyagi-san burger with furikake, fried egg, chili mayonnaise, honey bacon and onion rings. It was good but the patty was overcooked to well done as my friend specifically ordered it medium-well. I also found it to be super sticky eating. Even the bun was kind of sticky. It could have been better.\n\nService was good, attentive. I thought the place could be a little cleaner. The windows I was sitting at needed some dusting and I didnt like seeing a couple of flies buzzing by the window blinds. Parking was plentiful because its in a shared lot with several other businesses. Bachi gets full in a hurry. Within a half hour of me being seated (11:15am) the place was packed...Shoku Ramen's (formerly next door) menu is served at Bachi Burger now, so the paper signs say. Thank you Bachi Burger but I think I like the Summerlin location better. You know what they say about first loves... They  never die. And Summerlin won me over at first bite."
1,Evan not only knew his stuff but also offered best customer service. I recommend him highly.
0,Went here for breakfast...\nThe first thing I noticed was the weird smell from the parking lot. The restaurant is located right off the freeway in an old plaza. The entire building looked old and run down.\n\nThe lady waiting my table brought drinks and silverware to the couple sitting a 3 tables down. I did not get the same service. I found that odd.\n\nThe food selection was poor. They only eggs they had were scrambled eggs and eggs sunny side up. The bacon tasted very gamey and the pork sausage was dry. Most of the items looked like they had been sitting out for a while.\n\nFor less than $8 what can you expect? I would try another home town buffet but would not go to this specific one again.\n\nAlso the bathroom was a 4 out of 10 in terms of cleanliness. It smelled and looked liked it had not been cleaned that morning.
1,"First, let me say that I'm not one to eat at a buffet, sorely because i lose my appetite when I see piles of foods on trays lined up from one end of the wall to another.\n\nI was forced (yes, forced!) to go here with my family - party of 8 with two toddlers. Usually, for big parties wiith messy toddlers, the host would normally sit you in the corner away from other gobbling patrons, but not our case. we were just a few feet away from the food, yet not too close from foot traffic.\n(that's 1 star)\n\nThe buffet, being in the Orleans casino, serves southren food (among other \""international theme\"") - from crawfish to hush puppies. They also have cooked and raw oysters. Not bad for a $20. The only drawback is the desert section - they dont have much to offer tehre. But then again, I get stuffed easily and usually dont have much room for sweet shutffs.\n(that's 2 stars)\n\nThis is no Rio buffet, so there's really not much waiting. However, being that it was graduation week, there were a lot of locals with their graduating kids (still on their cap n gown). Stilll, we only waited for about 8 minutes.\n(that's 1 star)\n\nI got a bad impression of our server at first because instead of neatly placing our silverwares on the table, she would just toss it from the other end of the table, so I had to catch my fork as bouncess across the table. \n(that's -1 star)"
1,"I had a Color IQ and makeover appointment with Robbie a couple of days ago. The Color IQ was something I had been dying to do since my complexion can be baffling to match.  Unfortunately, the Color IQ actually did WORSE than I generally do on my own.  But no worries, Robbie went old-school and used his eyes to pick out a couple of colors, and found one that is the exact shade I expected the computer to come up with!\nMy previous experience with makeup artists was that they can be a little condescending, and not very warm or genuinely friendly.  Robbie (and everyone else I came in contact with) totally blew that out of the water.  He was really friendly and sweet, (and had breathtaking brows and shadow!) asked a lot of questions, made selections based on my answers, and was not pushy AT ALL about product purchase (disclaimer: Sephora does expect you to spend a certain amount, either $125 or $150 on products used during the makeover, but I believe the Color IQ is free).  He gave me a lot of different ideas and options, and I LOVED the look he gave me. The products themselves came from several different lines, and I liked that, too.  The skin care products he used on my face were a line I'd heard a lot about and was considering purchasing, so Robbie gave me a brief rundown on them and had another consultant come over and give me even more info while he gathered up my cosmetic purchases.  I cannot remember the skin care girl's name, but she put a generous sample in a little tub with a tag attached giving its name and instructions for use-very nice touch.\nI ended up asking Robbie to move in and do my makeup every day, but I do believe he gave me the tools and information to do it myself.  I did spend a lot of money, but this stuff all has purpose and won't end up in the back of a drawer.  Great experience!"
0,"I knew what I was getting into when I booked reservations at this hotel so I can't really say I was surprised at the experience. I was expecting dumpy, run down, lots of kids and probably not that great of service and that's basically what we got. \n\nWhy'd I still go ahead and book my reservation? Frightdome. Frightdome was one of the big reasons we came to Vegas on this trip. So we figured \""Might as well book a room in the same hotel that Frightdome will be in so we can just crawl back to our rooms when all is said and done.\"" and that's basically what we did. \n\nWe booked a room for Saturday night. Arrived a couple of hours before Frightdome was set to open, dropped our bags off in the room and actually rested a bit. To be honest...the rooms were actually pretty decent and the walls must have been super thick because I never heard anyone in the hallway or in the rooms around us the entire time. \n\nThe hotel/casino itself like I stated before is rundown and just not a pleasant experience. But on the upside it was a 10 minute walk from our room to Frightdome. Check in was a nightmare. They only had two people checking people in. We got in about a 20 person line and by the time we got up to the desk the line had doubled. When I commented about the lack of staff the person checking us in said that the hotel had made lots of cuts. Wonderful. \n\nOh, well. We had a decent night's sleep and got the hell out of dodge come 8am."
1,"Awesome, family owned and operated restaurant!  The owners are friendly and appreciative,  making sure our experience was enjoyable.   We tried two crepes - and fruity dessert crepe amd a lunch crepe with ham, turkey, and cheese.   The dessert crepe had freshly cut fruit and what seemed like homemade whipped cream on top.  At $8  I was hoping for more fruit, but it was tasty.  The lunch crepe was delicious and full of flavor.  It was $3 extra for two kinds of meat inside.  I recommend this place, just wish the crepes were more hearty!"
0,Wish I could give 0 stars.  I purchased a massage through LivingSocial but now the company refuses to book the massage without giving them an additional credit card number.  I've had shady companies charge me before even when they said it was just a card to keep on file.  This is beyond shady.\n\nI've paid you for a service and now you refuse to provide that service.  Good riddance.
1,"Aria was very nice! We had a corner suite that was lovely. We loved the sliding door that separated the bedroom from the living room. The automated lights and curtains were also great. \n\nNot five stars in our book mostly for the wait during check-in. While some say, \""you should always expect to wait to check-in in Vegas\"", we would argue that you should NEVER have to wait for a room that has been pre-booked. When will hotels realize that the current traditional check-in methods are a big downer. \n\nYou just walked into the place - and the first thing you do is STAND IN A LINE? Do the math on the common sense of a FIRST IMPRESSION hotel industry! \n\nThe bathroom had one of those fancy Toto? toilets. The master bath was big and had a big shower with a tub nearby. The tub had jets. \n\nThe pool at Aria, (we did not do the Liquid Pool), was nice. Our waitress/server was not good. \n\nThe valet wait was up to 20 to 35 minutes in the early afternoon. \n\nAria's location is not bad but it is not great either. It is a healthy walk from Aria to the the action in the heart of The Strip."
1,Was visiting family in Vegas when my niece anther famil brought this popcorn over.  I luved it. I can't wait for my order to show up....
1,This is a great little theatre. I have been to several theaters here in Charlotte and this is very similar to most. It has a great reception area for a drink before the show. I think this waste first time sitting in the balcony. I was on the right side and there were definitely parts of the stage I couldn't see. But over all it was a great experience.\n\nThe parking lot near the theatre was full so we parked at the 7th street station which was only $5 because no other events were going on.  It was only a block away.
0,"BUST! \n\nI was talked into going over to this joint instead of going to bed, gee thanks guys! I felt as I was trying to get into some classy club by having to stand in line and get past several bouncers at the door. Luckily I did get a 50% discount coupon from a promoter in the casino and got in for five bucks. Once inside, it was elbow to elbow trying to get to the bar. The music was so LOUD communication was impossible even by yelling and the use of hand signals. The main entertainment was a bunch of drunk girls trying to be sexy dancing on the bar while a sea of guys watched in awe. Gimmie a break! One of the CU girls would periodically get up on the bar and do a scheduled singing performance (apparently at gunpoint!) and entice more women to get up on the bar and perform. Bring your hearing protection!!! Free shots were given to the \""performers\"" to lube them up. So ladies, if you shop at Walmart, live in a mobile home, or are just too cheap to buy a decent drink, this is the place for you!"
0,"Location is perfect view to the lake but services pretty slow, food average a place to get a beer and see the lake ......"
0,"Came here with a wedding party to get a polish change. Went with the gel, first time experience. Paid 20 bucks, gave a 5 dollar tip. Keep in mind that was just a polish change, not a manicure. The color picked was light pink. 2 days later the color was nude with highlighter pink tips. Not impressed. Won't be back and feel like I overpaid for what I got. It's been  a week and a half and its peeling at my cuticles and 2 nails of my nails have broken. Ugh!"
0,"Meh. Food was cooked well, ingredients were fresh, but everything was bland, and the proportions in the food were off on everybody's plate (e.g. way too many mushrooms when compared to the meat or eggs). Service was blah; there weren't many customers, yet we waited, and waited, and waited, for everything. \n\nBathrooms were pretty disgusting, not how I prefer to either begin or end a meal. \n\nWe probably won't be returning anytime soon."
1,Ticket line fairly quick. Concession had lots of choices prices average for movie theaters. Great seats. Clean and comfortable.
0,"I received a call from this group asking for me by name!  When  I asked \""Who's calling?\"", the reply was \""Oh, I'm so glad I didn't get an answering machine.  She then launched into her very canned solicitation, saying something about how they \""help\"" women affected by breast cancer.  I said, \""That would be me\""  She never stopped.  I repeated, \""That would be me.\""  Kept talking.  I said, \""THAT WOULD BE ME\"".  Honestly, I said it five times, louder each time!   I said, \""You sound like an answering machine\""  \""Now please listen to me\""  I said\"" I've been trying to tell you I am a breast cancer survivor \""   She said  \""OH, thank you!\""   WHAT???  I said, \""Now I'd like to talk to you\""  NOPE!  As in another review, she couldn't hang up fast enough!  SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  WHAT??????   I was/am furious, to say the least!\n\nAs I required, I had to select a star, frankly,  I give zero stars to this group!"
1,"I have been here many times and anything I ever tried was awesome, can't go wrong here with any coffee beverage you may want. The reason why I couldn't give it 5 stars is that every time i tried to get a seat outside, was not possible, other than that I can say that I always go there with pleasure."
0,"The service was very slow, it took over 30 min for a steak sandwich and the plantains were a joke.  I wouldn't eat there if they gave it to me for free."
0,I used to come here all the time. Not anymore. The service is awful. They hired a couple guys with big earings in their ears that like to act like they're in grade school. They show no respect for any customers coming in and have no business in the food industry. I will gladly drive 2 miles out of my way to the next subway. Next time don't hire morons.
0,"G&D was a sad day for me. \nHave been super excited to check this place out because A. it looks Cool and B. friends have told me how awesome it is \n\nBut alas I have to give it a C.... We took the lightrail downtown for a Rattlers game and afterwards hit G&D for a drink and snacks afterwards.   It was really busy because of the hockey game being on so we couldn't find anywhere to sit in the bar area or even get to the bar to order a drink... so we found a table tucked in the corner in the \""restaurant\"" side... only probably here was service.. no one cared about those eating food!    We only had about 10 mins to look at a menu and order before the kitchen closed at 11 so we had to track down a waitress to take our order.\n\nMenu for food was quite typical.  Fish Sandwich, Burgers, etc.  Friends enjoyed it.. but also had a few beers in, so I cant say its more than any other \""bar food\""  I only ordered the chips and salsa which were less than adequate... straight from the store, nothing special at all.    I think this place could have been a lot better if we had better service and were in the bar area which is clearly the \""cool\"" part."
0,"I've read many positive reviews of Chaya that I almost wonder if I went to the same restaurant (I did)\n\nWe went on a Tuesday night, the service was fine, we weren't rushed...but there also weren't any parties waiting to be seated.\n\nThe positives - one of the best ginger dressings I've had. The sides of sticky rice that came with my dining companions entrees were very good. The roll sushi was good (cali roll, sunrise mix roll), but not unlike any other roll I've had. The portions are large, if that matters to you. The fried chicken that comes with the meal is decent, but nothing special.\n\nThe negatives (which far outweighed the positives on this occasion) The miso soup was incredibly fishy in the bad way, they use a fish broth that tastes like it's been sitting around or something. \n\nThree of my dining companions ordered the tempura (2 chicken, 1 veggie)  The dishes are very bland, no seasoning whatsoever. The texture itself is enjoyable, but you must rely on the accompanying teryaki sauce to get any flavor whatsoever. One guy in our party got the beef teryaki which looked good, and he confirmed this, but I did not try it.\n\nProbably the most dissapointing part of my meal was the part I was expecting to be the best - the nigiri pieces. I ordered uni (sea urchin) ika (squid) fluke fin, anago, and toro. \n\nI'm not really an uni fan, but this didn't appear to be fresh. Fluke fin is a muscle, so one would expect it to be tough at most sushi places but I was hoping for better from chaya (as an aside, umi managed to make it incredibly delicate) the squid was tougher than I would have liked. The anago was fine, but nothing special. Worst of all - the toro was a bit tough. To my understanding toro should never be tough.\n\nI'm hoping I just caught them on an off night. I do plan to give chaya a second chance as so many rave reviews make me hope that they truly can provide a great meal. I wanted to give Chaya a rave review, but my first experience was way less than stellar."
1,"Not that I will ever drive past here again (but who knows!) this was the coolest QT I have EVAH been in!  No seriously!  They had food selections like I've never seen before - I am now in love with bacon jerky - even the roller food looked somewhat appealing.\n\nYou could fill up here for the zombie apocalypse they have so much stuff but when I saw all the options you could get for coffee including a whipped topping - joy!!  And they had plenty of gas pumps too.  \n\nYeah, I got a good surprise in Surprise at this gas station ;)"
1,"Man, I love this place. Can't eat their regularly due to the fact that my waistline would explode and my wallet would wither away, but it's great and always a pleasant treat. \n\nTheir burgers are huge, and my guy and I have decided that the best course of action is to order 1 burger (they will half it for you and bring out each half on its own plate) and 2 sides (zucchini fries, sweet potatoes, or truffle - they're all good!)   I usually get either the turkey burger or the Zinburger, and both are excellent.\n\nI wouldn't recommend the salad, as I had one once, and for $10 bucks, it was awfully small and not worth the money.  The shakes look great, but there's so much food elsewhere that I've never ordered one."
1,"They have macarons for 89 cents each! \nThe size is quite small (about 4cm in diameter - yes I'm a math student), but they are imported from France and tasted just heavenly. \nI personally do not like macarons that are too sweet so theirs is just right for me. I also love the fact that they don't store them in a cooler (although that seems to be the \""right\"" way to do it).\nOther things they sell include a really wide selection of fine foods, European cookies and sweets, all kinds of cheeses, sandwiches, Asian grocery...I could easily walk out of that store with a $200 bill! I'm sure everyone can find something they like in there.\nNow, this is a bit of a rant...but their cashiers are so not friendly. Very impatient people. I remember when they were at the old location on Union street it wasn't like this. What happened?"
1,"We live in LA and the SLS here in Beverly Hills has been our favorite for a long time now. When we heard they were finally opened in vegas, naturally, we had to drive up for a short trip to check it out. \n\nLet's just say, I went from VERY excited (with what I thought I could expect from the SLS brand), to VERY apprehensive (I read the bad yelp reviews 5 mins before we arrived at the hotel, as we were driving along the strip) to, actually really liking it (after I adjusted my expectations accordingly.) \n\nNow, if you're coming here expecting the same SLS in Beverly Hills, you will be immensely disappointed. It is no where near as classy and luxurious. At all. The SLS in Las Vegas kinda reminds me of the ACE hotel in Palm Springs. A younger, hipster-cooler version of the SLS Beverly Hills, shall we say? It feels very laid-back, and LA. \n\nBut lets start what a few things I DIDN'T like: \n\n-The service. The service wasn't bad, or rude per say. They just don't have their act together and are incredibly disorganized. When we called to book two rooms, we specified that we would need connecting rooms. We get there and it's not set up. We wait, guy comes back and says he found us connecting rooms for an extra $15 per night per room. We take it. We go up to the room and it's NOT connecting. So I go all the way back down and wait in line for 15mins just to talk to him again (They only have 3 check in /check out counters thus, the wait). When I finally get to talk to him again (His name was Dominique, btw) I explain that he made a mistake and our rooms are in fact NOT connecting, he tells me \""I don't know which rooms are connecting or not cos the floor plan the hotel gives us doesn't tell us if it's connecting\"". Uhhhh, okay. That's not my problem, is it?! You should have your act together by now & even if you don't, telling me that doesn't solve ANYTHING for me. He then says, \""I need your patience and corporation because it's not my fault\"". Look, even if that might be true, YOURE NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY THAT. He then makes things worse by saying \""I have to physically run up to each room to check if it's connecting so it could take a long long time, I can't promise how long\"". That in itself was okay but it was HOW it said it. It just sounded so condescending. I guess what I'm trying to say is 1. It's the hotels fault and they really need to get their shit sorted out and 2. He could've handled it better. They really need to train their customer service staff. Good thing the bad service ended there, thus, only a 1 star deduction (it would've been a 2 star deduction but I think the good points made up for this a little)\n\n-The rooms (particularly the ones in the World Tower) are just not nice. To put it nicely, the rooms felt cheap and not high tech at all. You can be cool and hipster and rough around the edges if you are high tech and modern and up to date with the trends at least. But these were not. It felt like they really skimmed out making it feel like a luxurious hotel. The wallpaper felt cheap, there were manual blinds (not even automatic ones or blackout curtains). It wasn't horrible but I def wouldn't say it was nice. Just basic. Nothing special. \n\nNow onto things I DID like - \n\n-The food. Ohmygod, I could literally eat all my meals in this hotel and never leave. Which is actually what we really did. Lets face it, food in Vegas is disgusting. Food on the Strip especially. The ONLY good food I've ever had on the Strip was Joel Robuchon, but obviously, you're not always in the mood to spend $500-600 per person for a meal right? When that's the case, I suggest you come to the SLS. They have The Griddle Cafe (famous brunch place in LA), 800 degrees (built your own pizza, also from LA), Umami, Bazaar, Cleo (tapas) and Ku Noodles (chinese food) and Perq (the cooler hipster starbucks). Oh and the buffet. \n\n-Pool. Okay this is perhaps my FAV part apart from the food here. I LOVED that it DIDNT feel like a day club / big pool party like the rest of the pools in vegas. It was sexy and chic but also very very chill. I loved that! It was gorgeous, the foods and cocktails were mind blowingly amazing (get the appetizer sampler and the watermelon cocktail) and service was excellent! I could've spent all day there. \n\n-The casino. The casino is very very small, but that's what I liked abt it. It feels more like a hotel with a casino rather than a casino with a hotel if you know what I mean. I loved that! It was very hip and cool yet I found it attracted an older 30s crowd as opposed to young frat kids. That was a big plus. (Shit do I sound old?!)\n\n-They made an effort to hire hotter younger waitresses at the casino floor and at the pool. What? It makes a difference. \n\n-Nice, clean, well equipped gym that you don't have to pay for!\n\nOverall, this hotel def is very niche. It's not your usual high strung vegas experience. After all, it's pretty much off the strip. But if you want something DIFFERENT in a good way, this is the place to be"
1,"Fate is the best small brewery and restaurant in the Phoenix area!  It is not even close.  Their beers are always flavorful and delicious.  There are usually at least 6 of their own beers and a few \""guest\"" selections to choose from.  Always something for everyone.  The food is also excellent.  They could offer sharper knives for cutting the pizza.  That would be my only suggestion.  They have indoor and outdoor seating with a great concrete bar and 2 TV's with the sound off.  A \""garage door\"" joins the inside and outside areas together.  My favorite beer selections are the Irish Red and the American Pale Ale.  Both are excellent.  Also anything with Hatch Chili's is pretty good as well.\n\nFausto is a great server.  If you are lucky enough to get him you will be well taken care of.\n\nI have been to many other craft breweries in Arizona and none are as good as Fate."
0,"Staff ok, nothing special. Burgers ok, for the price and taste.  In and out beats five guys for price, taste and customer service. CAUTION- if you get fries and burger to go.. Grease went thru the paper bag and onto my car seat"
1,"This place was pretty good. The tableside guac was great. The decor is really nice. The service was fast and friendly. Careful, it's easy to fill up on the chips and salsa and refried beans. This was a good choice in this large strip-mall area."
0,"Actually to the last reviewer, yes they do run on a rigid schedule here, if your even 5 minutes late your skipped and have to reschedule. I've been with uw system now for about 2 yrs since my employers plan switched us from Dean.  And I have to say I miss dean so much. Better service, friendlier doctors, the list goes on. This opinion also applies to most of their clinics ( urgent care, optometry, psychology, hospital/ER)"
1,They have a great selection of food and a special menu right now a 4.99 pick one item special.  We eat here a lot and the food and salsa is great.  They are understaffed though and the service is sometime slow.  But you cant beat the price for the food you get.
0,5:38 pm on a Tuesday nite and the bar manager lets the Guinness keg run dry then takes 20 minutes 2 change it.  Really? In an Irish bar?  LAME!
1,"This place is great. It's like a cross between a fast-food and a regular restaurant.  It has a really casual upscale fast-food atmosphere, and the food is really fresh and delicious!\nIt has become one of my favorite places for a quick bite."
1,"I love the Rock Bottom Restaurant but I am not too crazy about the Rock Bottom Brewery. The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the beer is not the greatest in my opinion. \n\nThe burgers are good but my favorite is the Sonoma Chicken Wrap. Which is a wrap cut in two with Chicken, bacon, gucamole and spinach as the main ingredients. This wrap hits the spot, I think the Guac really makes this dish.\n\nThe Rock has $5 happy hour specials on the appetizers. The nachos are good but would be excellent if Guac was served with them instead of paying extra for 2 small dollups of Guac. The firecracker shrimp is excellent as well. But the most amazing app is the Titan Toothpick which is like 4 footlong very skinny chicken burritos serve with Guac. This one app alone can fill up most anyone.\n\nAnd of course, I love their patio. Which is big and compy with plenty of misters for the warmer part of the year."
0,"I would love to rate higher, and if someone had brought it to me, I probably would. Their food offerings are somewhat limited, but all delicious. I've ordered foods and coffees both times I've been here. I live right down the street and was excited to see such a promising cafe so nearby. \n\nUnfortunately, I have to reiterate what others have said - the culture here is very clique-ish. If you're prepared to brave rude stares and be excluded from casual chit chat, step inside and purchase a treat. Then leave."
1,Best tamales ever. Molly is really nice as well.
1,Sweet baby jesus the garlic hummus is to DIE for. Switch up the oh so good but carbo bad bread accompanying said hummus with fresh veggies. Score. Be still my heart.
1,"I was in need of a couple of tires for a full size pick up truck....being in need of a bargin I surfed the web and came across these reviews and had to give Big Earl a try. Let me tell you......those before me who wrote reviews were not lying. I first called and Big Earl answered and took the time to look up my tire size where most places would have rushed me off the phone. He told me what he did and did not have and what options would fit my vehicle. Great customer service. I made my way over and can certainly say, this business man is worth giving a try. He provides the service most business have forgotten about.....quick, economical and friendly."
0,"Was a regular here. Used to visit once a week. Now after two visits in a row of them 'losing' my order, I am considering going elsewhere. At the time I didn't have time to wait for a remake. They offered me brownies and chips as consolation. That just didn't reverse my frustration. \n\nThe sign on the wall says something like \""quality takes time, it will be a miracle if you get your sandwich in less than 5 minutes\"". This is acurate. The sandwiches are good. Some unique combinations, combined with great herb garlic bread makes the sandwiches nearly worth the 8 bucks you are going to shell out. However, a Jimmy Johns opened a mile or two down the street. I get my food in 1 minute and haven't had an order \""lost\"". \n\nI would have given them 4 stars prior to the last two visits, but the continuous loss of my confidence and over priced food brings it down to a two. It will be some time before I make it back to cheba."
1,"I came to Metro Pizza on the recommendation of a friend who lives in Las Vegas.  This place is good.  The service was fast and the prices were reasonable.\n\nMy daughter and I split a Honolulu Pizza.  My wife ordered Eggplant Parm.  The food was served promptly, and even though we were seated in the back of the restaurant, we were not ignored.\n\nThe next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be back."
0,"Rude!!! Went to the window at 8:53 and no one was around, a minute later a girl comes up and says they're out of boba and no hot drinks because they're about to close.  I said, \""ok nevermind\"" since it was such a burden to her.   As we were leaving, she was actually happier that we weren't getting anything, which would've caused her to actually work."
0,"As a New Yorker, I was looking forward to trying out Chompie's since all my friends have said that I would love it. When I walked in, I could see why - The decor was New York themed, with the Yankees taking up a whole wall in the back and Broadway posters lining the walls by the bathroom. I sat down and looked at the menu, where I saw many familiar offerings.\n\nAfter receiving my food, however, I was disappointed. The Chopped Steak was bland and tasteless. I could not finish it. My friends that ordered other dishes didn't seem to like their meals either. The salad was okay, the fries pretty good. I would not come back for the food.\n\nThe service was lackluster too; waitresses did not refill the water often enough, and my friends soon resorted to sticking ice cubes in their mouth while waiting.\n\nVery disappointed."
1,"Great Costo.  They are different than the regular warehouses.  Specializing in restaurant and convenience items this warehouse is packed with supplies and bigger food packs.  I love the selection of Torani products as well as prepared veggies (cut and ready to serve onions, lettuce, salads, etc)  They don't carry everything that regular Costco does and some things are too big for the regular home customer but the ability to buy plastic restaurant style glasses for cheap is terrific! (great for tile floors!)  I love the selection of snack foods and specialty drinks.  I also buy Thrifty Ice Cream here!"
1,"Great appetizers, food and service. Nice wine list with 1/3 off bottles tonight. Will be back."
1,"nice athmosphere, i really like this place.. granted i have only been there for the First Fridays crowd, so i am not sure what to expect on a regular week. i am hoping the same thing just a liiiitle less crowded.. recommended chill spot"
1,"I enjoyed the prime rib, and I thought it was reasonably priced. We sat in the bar which was noisy, but we still got good service from the waitress. The trout and cous cous was also very good. We split the banana cream pie for desert and it was so fresh with real banana's. Would definitely go back."
0,"Worst dinning experience ever, over an hour to be served, half the meal was never delivered, but we were charged for it. I will never go back!!!!!!!!!!! Wish I didn't have to give it a one star, should be a negative five stars."
0,"Went for lunch. As with any Vegas buffet, the quality of the food is a gamble, and not one you're very likely to win. Sadly, this one counts as a big loss.\n\nAside from the typical decor, it doesn't even feel like a restaurant. Plates and utensils are washed en masse, resulting in eating surfaces that look like they were simply sprayed with a hose and dipped in sanitation solution. In other words, everything looks dirty.\n\nThe food is awful. There's really no other way to put it. Looking at positive reviews, I can't for the life of me understand how anyone could eat this stuff with a smile. Maybe low prices are intoxicating their sense of judgment or they have the perfect combination of deadened taste buds and iron stomachs. The only other buffet I've been to that's worse than this one was at Sante Fe Station, and that one induced vomiting.\n\nOne can't help but shake the feeling this is the foods last chance at being served. Most of the options appear to be right at the borderline of expiration, or at least of the lowest quality. There are seven sections: BBQ, American, Asian, Italian, Mexican, Dessert and the Salad Bar. Don't even think about seafood, because there isn't any. I did my best to try a bit of everything, but it was tough finding anything appetizing from the Asian or Mexican areas. They don't even look right.\n\nMeats are profoundly dry, akin to soft wood. Vegetables are fresher than anything, but the taste of the cooked ones manages to be awful as well. Fruit amounts to little more than watermelon. Meanwhile, you have a bountiful selection of breads. Great. And don't forget dessert. It rounds out the stomach cramps nicely. Though to be fair, they do have a gelato station that sticks out like a sore thumb in a place like this.\n\nI can handle a bad meal as much as anyone, but this stuck with me the rest of the day, assaulting my stomach with night terrors. The single thing I can honestly say I enjoyed was a potato. I implore anyone with a mouth to go anywhere but this people trough. Even from a financial point of view, the food court will satisfy more for the same price."
0,"I was so excited to have a cupcake from Carlos bakery because on t.v they make it seem like they are the best in the whole world so I figured I would try them. I had a red velvet and a peanut butter chocolate cupcake.I was quite disappointed actually. It wasn't by far any better than cupcakes at my local bakery \"" Sift \""."
1,"I pretty much always go to a Harkins (and it's usually it's this one) when I go to the movies. They're all comfortable, clean, and I like the whole discount cup deal for drinks & the popcorn shirt offer (as long as I'm not the one who has to wear that silly thing).\n\nThis location is big. There are several options for movies/movie times, and for the most part the lines to buy tickets & at the concessions stand move quickly (although there has been a few times when I'm here they've let the concession stands really get backed up before getting additional help). \n\nAt the end of the day I really don't see where this location stands out compared to other Harkins w/several screens (of course this location DOES the large Cine Capri screen for whatever the \""big\"" movie is a that time, so I guess there's that). However, that's a good thing since IMO since Harkins usually provides a consistently good movie experience."
1,"We were in Vegas for the week for my daughter's wedding and wanted to try someplace different...not a chain, not on the strip, but great none the less....we found it in Viva Zapatas!\n\nWe went on a Monday night, and made reservations since there were going to be about 10 of us.\nWe only had to wait about 10 min. after we got there, no problems at all.\nIt isn't very big, but it's decorated wonderfully and it doesn't feel crowded at all, just right.\nOne thing I loved is that the entire time we were there there was a 1 man mariachi playing a guitar and singing live. I don't know if he is there all the time or not, but I loved it...just added to the ambiance.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer of Queso Fundido con Chorizo in addition to the complimentary chips, salsa, and frijoles. Oh my goodness! It was the best, cheesiest, sausage-y goodness ever!\n\nOur table also ordered a pitcher of Cadillac Margs...the \""pitcher\"" was more of a carafe, but the margs were delish!\n\nWith 10 of us there were a variety of entrees ordered and everyone loved theirs. Mine was a cheese enchilada and chili relleno, both were delicious.\n\nFlan for dessert topped off the evening perfectly. \n\nWhen I'm in Vegas again I will definitely go back!"
1,"What a welcome addition to the neighborhood full of yummy food choices!  There are so many options, each burger is as original as you!   If you are up to the challenge, may I suggest their 20oz burger!   With a mountain of fresh toppings, each bite is a new experience!  If you finish it and the fries......you become a legend on their wall of fame.  Over 50 ingredients to create the perfect shake, you just can't go wrong here!    Bring an appetite and perhaps a bib, you won't be disappointed!"
1,"Very creative menu.  Delicious food for the most part.  Occasionally there have been some weird waitresses in there that act like they are too good to help you, and you are an inconvenience.  I was very put off when I walked in and asked if I could order something to go and was told \""NO\""...seriously WTH? You don't want my money...alrighty then."
1,"Awesome, healthy place to eat. Most things can be made gluten-free, if thats important to you. The staff are nice and friendly. Foods a bit overpriced to be sure, but it is high quality! The Bison Burger was FRIKKIN SWEET"
0,"Don't waste your time here because they certainly don't care about their awful service. Went at 7 before the Darius Rucker concert Fri night. Waited at our patio table for 30 minutes for a server. Hostess & multiple servers passed & didn't acknowledge us. Ever. We should have left then, but it was the only restaurant in the entire complex that could seat us. Finally flagged down the hostess to get a server. Went for the $9.95 pizza deal that was advertised, only to be told after our orders were placed that they were all out of pizza. By 7pm, you're already out of the special?!?!? C'mon!!! Unacceptable. Ordered the mussels & crostini instead. Mussels were barely visible, they were so small. Overpriced & incredibly tiny. Ordered meatballs (came w/3) & a cheese plate. About 3 pieces of cheese & some nuts were on that for $10! These were all being shared among 4 people, yet the portions aren't enough to feed 1!! For our 4 appetizers, 4 glasses of house wine & 2 vodka soda's, our tab came out to $150. NEVER going back. Ridiculously overpriced, inadequate portions, worst service ever!!!!!!! How they stay in business is beyond me!"
1,"I have been through, LITERALLY, nearly 50 hairdressers in my lifetime and have never gone back to the same person twice. I'm picky, ok? I called Kelly Cardenas Salon on Wednesday and got an appointment with Colie that same day. All of the staff was amazing from the moment I walked in the door. I was offered water, coffee, tea, and WINE! At the front desk, I was told if I needed ANYTHING, a cab, dinner reservations, ANYTHING, that they would do it.  I was given a small tour of the salon, then was shown the dressing room where I was able to hang my jacket and put on a robe. I was then led into the \""shampoo room\"" and I will just say, it was AMAZING in there. The sinks adjust to you, relaxing music is played and all the while, you're getting an amazing scalp, neck, and shoulder massage. Colie explained everything she was doing to my hair so my fear that I'd look down and see a chunk of hair fall from my head was alleviated. She was careful about taking off just the right amount of length. The price was VERY reasonable. The experience in itself was amazing. Rather than dreading a trip to the salon, now, I can't wait to go back."
0,We have had dinner at many churascaria restaurants here in the Vegas area and this is by far the worst . We called ahead of time for dinner pricing and the check was  double the price we were quoted by phone for our two kids . We were not served all the meats they advertise for dinner and servings were few and far between . Our first serving of meat was 45 minutes after we arrived and they deli slice the meat paper thin . HORRIBLE !!!!! RIP OFF!!!!
0,"This place deserves a -5. \n\n\nThe receptionist/front desk staff....\nWhere do I begin about that... Seriously, the most unprofessional, rude, and disorganized front desk staff ever...\n\nI went there because I recently moved close to the area and they had an earlier appointment than the other places I called.. \n\nUpon entering, the receptionist didn't even greet me and my boyfriend... She waited for us to say something.. How can we say something if we didn't know that your were busy because you didn't bother to say, hello. Rude.. \nThen I tell her that I've never been and I just need a fitting for glasses and contacts.. She goes on about prices like she was warning me.. First of all, why would you go about pricing right away, it just makes it seem like you're judging us by telling us a price WITHOUT US ASKING and waiting for our response.. \n\nSecond, I paid 70 something instead of 100 something dollars that the receptionist stated.. Do your job and do it right lady.. \n\nAnd lastly, I come back to pick up my contact lens and I tell her my name and last name and she tells me it's not there.. Uhm, it clearly is there because YOU CALLED ME ten minutes before I went there.. I wouldn't drive there for no reason.. Then she's like oh, well you said your name was so and so ... \nMy last name is what you should be looking for and that didn't change since I was born, but she didn't bother asking me to confirm if it was me.. \nI was pissed..\n\nLast encounter with these ladies... I called to ask a simple question... It turned into me calling and emailing corporate.. That wasn't good.. \n\nI see that people have had some bad experiences with the staff.. Yep, not just me."
0,"The service was horrible!  Almost missed our flight today because the security line was so long... it wound around and went across the terminal!  They only had 2 people checking boarding passes and 2 belts for bag checks, but only one xray scanner for all normal passengers to bottleneck through. Meanwhile they had the same amount of checkers for a separate, much shorter business and first class line and they only had to go through the metal detector.  We had to wait 45 minutes in the normal line while we watch the business and first class people go right through!"
1,"First & Foremost.... This place is currently open. I'm not sure why there is a closed notice. I'm going to inquire and try to fix this error.\n\nThanks to Yelp yet again, I discovered this place a couple years ago.\nTheir food is great. (I recommend the chicken lettuce wraps!)\nIt's not super smokey. \nShuffle board, pool, darts, deer hunter...and connect 4. \nThe bartender Joey is AMAZING! He makes it a point to know your name and take great care of his customers. \n\nLast night about 30 of my co-workers and I took the place over for about 5 hours. Joey and the 1 other bartender had no trouble taking care of us and their normal crowd. \n\nOff the Strip is a great locals spot with quality food!"

0,"I have been here twice with my BF for a couples massage. It was decent the first time, but we were disappointed this last time- not in the massages- but in the staff. \n\nYour walls are very thin...we could hear every word you said. Not cool"
1,"It's a good thing Due Forni and this place are so far apart. It gives me a good distribution of pizza places around town that serve quality you can actually taste and touch clearly. This is worth your visit, but I'm not so sure the price is justified. But whatever. Until more places like this are out...\n\nThe crust is soft, chewy, and a little salty. If you look on the bottom of it, there is an uneven pattern of burn marks and the dough is clearly hand-tossed. It is folded velvety, like some kind of silk cloth someone just casually set down. It is thin, and holds some delicious, aromatic ingredients on top. Nothing is overdone on these pizzas. Not too much of any ingredient in any bite.\n\nI couldn't tell you my favorite because I like everything I've tried. Just close your eyes, point at the paper and say, \""that one.\"" Again, it is a bit overpriced for a single-serve pizza. Don't go in here expecting cheap. Expect flavors. Savor every slice."
0,"Stayed in the Empire tower. Sad, tired affair - saggy sheets, hairs in toilet, smells from wash basin, beat up elevator. Everyone of the toilets on the casino floor was spattered with feces. Food options are sub par.\n\nUntil management has the decency to do a major upgrade, they should not align their name with that great city.\n\nYuck."
1,"Not too sure what else I can say about DT but that I'm addicted to it. I eat here a couple times a week because it is quick, cheap and tastes as good as you can get for a Mexican fast food chain. I always get coupons in the mail and use all but the chicken ones because why people come here for chicken is beyond me. This last time I used a coupon that got me a macho combo burrito for just $2! I was all over that. I change it up from time to time and get it either double wrapped, or all beef no beans, maybe some extra red AND green sauce, it just depends on my mood. The macho combo burrito is filling and not intended for the weak. My wife has a hard enough time finishing a half pound burrito and usually just sticks to the value bean and cheese burrito for only .50 cents. It was Tuesday taco night so I got 6 soft tacos (3 no lettuce for the fur-baby) as well. taco night is every Tuesday from 3pm - 11pm and regular tacos are 3 for $1.09 or you can upgrade to 3 classic tacos for a $1 more. My tacos were as good as always. I also tried this new crunchtada tostada. It tastes like the tostada they already have on the menu, but you can get it with beef or chicken if you don't just want beans, cheese and sauce. The crunchtada was just ok.\n\nDT offers different breakfast deals that are worth checking out. Save your receipt to use for a free 1/2 pound bean and cheese in your next visit. Don't forget to save room for caramel cheesecake bites."
0,"If I didn't have a big pizza in front of my face, I would have thought I ordered a big serving of attitude with a side of screw you.\n\nMaybe it's because we came in with a coupon...but this place had more ego than a 15 minute celebrity.  \n\nNot to knock small, family owned places (usually I love going to places like that, because USUALLY you get a friendly family feel), but for a pizza joint located in a shopping center next to Albertson's, they sure wanted to make you think you were eating caviar.\n\nThings not so awesome:\n1.  Whomever answered the phone didn't know East from West to be able to give directions\n2.  Our waitress couldn't give any suggestions on the food\n3.  They can't do a half and half pizza unless you paid extra\n4.  You pay a charge if you want to split a plate of food\n5.  ATTITUDE, ATTITUDE, ATTITUDE\n6.  Tip was already included in our bill\n\nI've never been to a family run pizzeria that can't do a half and half pizza, and the only restaurants I've ever been to that charge to split a plate of food are ones where you'd feel more comfortable wearing  a dress - definitely not one in a strip mall like this one.\n\nI swear if the two waitresses rolled their eyes or huffed any more than they already did, they probably would have fainted from lack of oxygen and vertigo.\n\nAnd last time I looked, I believe I was old enough to do my own math for your tip.  If you were so scared we were going to stiff you on your tip, maybe you should learn a little something called Cuss-toe-mer Sur-viss.\n\nFoodwise, the pizza was not the best I've ever had, in fact it was a bit on the dry side.   I can't say it was absolutely horrible, but neither can I say I was in heaven.  The wings were much better, in my opinion.\n\nFor the pain of the drive and having to dodge eye daggers, this is a definite no-peat."
0,"Yech. Seriously, yech. I don't understand what the fuss is with Garduno's.\n\nI was visiting friends in Vegas and hoping that we would go to Viva Mercado's (I truly heart that place so much) and instead I'm being dragged to a casino near their house - and it's a local casino that I HATED going to when we lived in Vegas - which just happens to house Garduno's. It's the Fiesta Rancho casino.\n\nSo not only am I doomed to suffer from bad mexican food (I have been to Garduno's before in that same casino) I am forced to wade through locals who are so hell bent on gambling.\n\nI decided to order their fajitas. What a freaking mistake. They were sizzling and so deceptive. They smelled so wonderful. My mouth was actually watering. Then after I assembled my fajita into the flour tortilla, I took a bite.\n\nNothing. No flavor, even the onions had been blanded out. How the fuck do you do that? Seriously. How the fuck can you get onions to lose their taste?! How? HOW? H O W ?! I could only tell the difference between the bell pepper and the onion thanks to texture. Their \""rice\"" was just that...rice.\n\nIt was a disappointment through and through. Service was ok and that's why I'm giving it 2 stars. The food was shite.\n\nThe atmosphere is loud. But I don't think their location within a casino really helped with that. You could hear the slot machines outside of the restaurant. One slot machines was so freaking loud I could swear I could hear it over the din of everything...and it was shouting, \""WHEEL OF FORTUNE!!!\"" I kid you not. If it were a kid I'd have turned to it and said, \""You're indoors now. Little voice.\""\n\nDecor is such a throwback to the 80s. You know what I'm talking about - that alleged upscale restaurant with the puffy booths and that nasty peach/pink pastel color teamed with green along with the sea green acrylic tabletop. ugh. I needed an intervention when I was sitting in that place. Badly.\n\nAfter all that hassle, I even paid for the crappy food for my friends and myself. I waved good-bye to my friends later on and made a beeline for Roberto's. Yea, I was that pissed off and angry at my food. I'd have gone to Viva Mercado's, but they were closed at 2am.\n\nJust a note -- why did Garduno's get voted best as one of the Best of Las Vegas? Does anyone in Vegas have taste buds? If they did, they'd be screaming for either Roberto's or Viva Mercado's as a Best of Las Vegas.\n\nSeriously, don't fall for Garduno's anywhere. I've had the misfortune of eating at 3 different ones in 3 different places -- don't fall for that nasty, bland, SALTY food."

1,"Have been here several times now and they are consistently great. They really do put the other place I used to go to to shame!  So glad to have found a place you can trust, who do a good job with great prices too."
0,"Not impressed. Perhaps because I have been able to enjoy Mexican food in the States, where it's closer to the source and probably more authentic. I found Chiquito to be a bit like a Mexican Friday's, with the glossy menu and the focus on expensive alcohol drinks.\n\nI did still want a margarita, which I found to be only reasonably decent. Too much triple sec and ice, not nearly enough tequila. I didn't send it back, but I didn't have another. Still, it was a treat with the chips and salsa. It's the salsa I like - big pieces of tomato with plenty of spicy pepper mixed in. Easy for scooping.\n\nMy main - enchiladas with chicken - was served in a crock bowl on a ceramic plate. The bowl was extremely hot of course as was most of the meal. I was therefore unhappy as I ate from the outside towards the center, only to find the center was only warm. I didn't send this back either. The flavor was good, including the small amount of guacamole on top, but that temperature put me off.\n\nI chose not to risk a dessert. In the end, my craving for Mexican was not satisfied. I would not return."
0,"Menu seemed underwhelming.  Took my 8 year old daughter to breakfast Saturday morning before work. We are both light eaters,  the easiest thing w could order was two eggs over easy with a side of bacon and sausage, my coffee age her chocolate milk. Waited 30 minutes and paid $33?!?!?\n\nNothing on the menu enticed me to return again. But it's walking distance to work. Hope their lunch is better"
1,"This place was the answer to my prayers, since I am currently shopping for upcoming birthdays and want to send packages featuring Arizona-sourced goodies. Thanks to Yelp (and Gabi M.'s review, in particular), Poppa Maize \""popped\"" up on my radar and fit the bill beautifully for my needs.\n\nThis tiny storefront is packed with a dazzling variety of flavored popcorn and an array of packaged choices. I stuck with the $3 (medium) bags and collected a rainbow of flavors. For myself, I grabbed Cheesy Chipotle and Candy Bar Caramel. These didn't sit long at home before I succumbed to the urge to munch! For gifts, I selected Pineapple-Jalape\u00f1o, Cheese & Bacon, and Cookies & Cream. Unfortunately, they didn't have any German Chocolate Cake popcorn in the inventory, but I am dying to try that concoction should it reappear in the future.\n\nWhat was most notable was how friendly the service was. I mentioned that I was trying to shop for locally-sourced items and was offered a copy of the November 2009 Phoenix magazine which featured a compendium of Mom & Pops and local businesses. Not only did this help me with my birthday-shopping research, but also made me feel better about my quest. According to Phoenix magazine (who cites Local First Arizona), \""When you shop at locally owned businesses, your money is recirculated and creates up to 75 percent more tax revenue to our community and state.\""\n\nCall it my way of battling the Great Repression and certain anti-Arizona boycotts that are unfairly damaging this great state's economic health. Aaah, sweet (and savory) economic justice! Crunch... crunch!"

0,"If I could do less than one star I would basically the most unprofessional office I have ever had to deal with in my entire life. \n\n1. When I first Got pregnant I didn't have insurance, I was one month away from getting it at my new job and applied for their OB Package, My Appt was at 2:30 and was not seen until 4:30. The worker was very rude basically because I was over income and did not qualify for assistance at all, She actually made me feel bad for even asking for help. I then talked to my work and they added me early to the company  plan to help me out. At my first visit I asked to not use their payment plan and pay that visit and ultrasound in cash at that time. Weeks later I received a bill for $930 dollars the remainder of the original  1200 down payment of the OB plan I no longer needed.  I was Livid I had to call several different people, several Different  times and never got confirmation that is was handled which really stressed me out, I finally had to call back and find out if everything was was done and it was finally taken care of. \n\n2.Out of Control wait times, as I stated above for the financial aid Appt I had to wait 2 hours then on my Appt on 10/22 my Appt Time was 3:40 and was asked to come 20 min early so Arrival at 3:20pm and then was not seen until 5:20 two hours after my arrival time. with no apologies or Explanation,  and no one even in the lobby waiting. \n\n3. the most important,  I had explained to my Doctor, the site manager and the schedulers several times  that I am a heart patient and have had two open heart surgery operations, and still have a weak heart, and  the increase in the blood volume  due to my pregnancy may cause problems for my heart creating proper blood flow for my child and my cardiologist has recommended close monitoring including frequent ultrasounds and  follow up visits. I would be considered a high risk pregnancy, and I was not being treated as such.  after my visit on 10/22 where I did not receive an ultra sound I requested the DR be asked if he could make sure at my next visit I had one  I asked the scheduler to get the authorization from the dr,  for my next appt,  and I would like a call back so my boyfriend could also take time off to be there, he came last time and I didn't get my ultra sound.  they set the appt and I never got a call back about the ultrasound, I called back 11/1  at 1pm and spoke to another scheduler and my request was not taken care, I asked again that the dr be asked for the authorization, so I can have an ultra sound, on 11/6 in the  morning I got a call from someone in the office and she  said they will not do an ultrasound until 18 or 20 weeks. I was honestly in disbelief.l felt  like Adelante didn't care about me or my unborn child. I have been trying for YEARS to have a child, and had complication after complication,  and was actually told I would never conceive and Finally  my dreams, I thought were coming true, and I was being given the shaft. I really liked my doctor but at this point I needed a doctor and facility who will take my health and concerns seriously\n\nFrom the very start of my Pregnancy I feel as though I have been given the shaft, from the Financial aid worker, making me feel bad because I made to much to qualify  for assistance, to receiving and erroneous bill for $930 Which was taken care of but,  still really stressed me out. To being denied the medically necessary monitoring I required for a healthy baby and pregnancy.  I would recommend highly going elsewhere this place only caters to those on public benefits and  assistance and could care less about hard working people as demonstrated by the schedulers once again My last and final complaint is this, I made an appt for my 1 month follow up Visit on 11/21/13 I asked for the latest appt possible and told that was 4pm( even though last time I wasn't even seen until almost 5:30 pm, I really didn't  want to miss any more work if I didn't have to, and was told 4 pm was the latest they could do even though they say they are open until 7pm.\n\nJust take my advise avoid this place like the plague!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n."
0,"Staff was outright rude.  They were condescending, never apologized once for the wait.  Also saw crickets and roaches near kitchen and in bathrooms which made me want to vomit.  Unless you want a roach roll do not eat here!  I will be spreading the word that this place should be condemned!"
1,Went in for my first Brazilian. I was a little nervous as I have never been through this process before. The customer service was great and my wax tech Brittney was awesome. She talked me through everything and was very professional. She also was very knowledgeable of all the products and willing to answer all my questions. The whole thing was a lot less painful then I was anticipating and I love how smooth my skin is! I will definitely be back!
1,"Great news: we found out that the \""cheese price increase\"" from a few months ago seems to have been a real thing. They've remedied this and the pizza is back to $5 again. \n\nAn update since last time: the cinnamon sticks are really good. Surprisingly good. And the staff are friendly and generous with handing out a second tub of frosting. \n\nWe've never had a bad experience here, and have had several great experiences with the co-owner. \n\nThanks, guys!"
0,"This place is awful for multiple reasons:\n1. Food - bland, under cooked, unoriginal. I ordered yucca fried which tasted like freezer burn. They were mushy and undercooked. The tacos were lackluster too. Chicken tinga was dry and portobello mushroom was slimy and not seasoned at all. Totally gross. Not worth any money. This place should honestly shut down based on food alone.\n\n2. Service - how long does it take to bring out water? 15 minutes apparently. It's slow, which is incredibly surprising given how empty the place is. The waitress didn't even ask me if I wanted a second drink. I would've said no bc my first was gross.\n\nThis place is worse than a college dining hall. Food is gross, service is slow, I'm never coming back and openly hating on this place via yelp."
1,Go here as soon as you land in Phoenix! The Pizza tastes like its right off the streets in Italy and it should because the owner seems to be right off the streets of Italy. The complimentary Limoncello tastes like chilled cake icing in a cup! The Peroni was ice cold. The bruschetta was so fresh! I had the Diavola pizza. I soaked it in their chili infused olive oil. I'm telling you it was the best pizza I've had west of the Atlantic!
0,"First I need to say that I LOVE Roberto's, it is my new favorite Taco Bell/Del Taco etc.  Since moving here in Feb. 12' I can say that it is certainly my favorite little drunken munchies spot.  \n\nNow, on to this specific Roberto's.  This is the third location that I have tried so far and this one is by FAR the worst; and this is coming after a couple pitchers with the munchies raging!  I ordered the rolled tacos with gauc which tasted just like the other 2, hence why they got 1 of the stars.  The other star is because the food was served very quickly, but alas, I believe this is why my second dish was not great.  \n\nI got the cheese enchilada meal.  The sauce tasted okay, but the main problem was the cheese was not even melted inside, just a bunch of shredded cheese that I did not enjoy inside my luke-warm enchilada.  My friend also ordered our 'GO TO' meal, chimichanga, mmm mmm mmm; however, at this Roberto's it was bleh bleh bleh!  The tortilla was not fried nearly enough, the chicken was wet, not moist, wet, and overall it was barely even warm.  \n\nI have marked this Roberto's off my list and will not return, which is a shame, because I was hoping to make it my local spot on Tuesdays as it's less than a mile from my local bar."
0,"I was coming here pretty frequently ( average of twice a week).   At first this was because of the great price but the pho grew on me and after having tried a few other local places I decided this would be my go to spot.\n\n  I do not expect great service or even an overall clean dining area when consuming Vietnamese food.    I've come to realize that neither of those things matter if the food is fresh and curbs my constant need for pho.\n\n  My relationship with blue moon ended when I (the sole dining patron that afternoon) was told to sit wherever as the woman who was working there could not bother to get up from her table full of food she was scarfing down to even put on menu on the table I chose to sit at.  Not a big deal...everyone's gotta eat and I've worked in enough restaurants to know that that this can be hard to fit into your work day.  I also know that It's unprofessional, against health code and not the best start to a diner's experience to witness an employee eating in the dining room.  Since I had to get my own menu and I have seen the woman before I assume that perhaps she realizes I already know what I want as I often order the same thing.  I wait about 2 minutes for her to stop eating and come take my order when another man that works there comes in with a banner that they both proceed to stare at for a few minutes and then sit down to discuss.  Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.  As the next 2 minutes role by with me pondering over the options of breaking up with blue moon and how this will not only impact my eating habits but many other facets of my life,  I decide that I can no longer take the blatant disregard of ANY needs of the only paying customer.  I stare the 7 feet from where I am seated to the other 66.6% of human presence in the room waiting..... After another 2 minutes NOTHING. I fling the menu on the counter and yell \""thanks!\"" to both of them as I storm out.  Yes I could have yelled across the room that I was ready to order...but why?\n\nLater blue moon...you lost an easy-to-please-low-maintenance regular."
0,"My first impression of this place was not so great. It it gloomy, dirty (I had to wipe the window sill before putting my backpack on it). It smells, the waitresses were unprofessional (but nice!), and lots of equipments were not working properly. The food doesn't look fresh, it might even be microwaved. I had a croissant and a mango smoothie. I can't say it was horrible, but I ate to fill my stomach, not for the taste. \n\nI felt bad for two French tourists who apparently love Montreal. They might like the city less after this. \n\nThe only advantage is how close it is to the Mont-Royal metro station. Oh and there is wifi."
1,"I love this place, first it's like a Palestinian deli in NYC, they have freshly made salads, hummus, also Cornish hen, and THR portions a HUGE...so you need to be hungry!\nThe food it's fantastic and you can have also amazing desert!\nWon't be disappointed!"
1,"So M and I went to La Hacienda for restaurant week and loved it. We're big fans of mexican food so we were eager to have a date night just down the street. \n\nThe ambiance has an old mexican villa feel to it. We started with cocktail and sadly they didn't have our preference in vodka, Stoli Orange, so we settled with Svedka Orange. It was on the sweet side but tolerable. I had beef empanadas for a starter, pork tenderloin for an entree, and pastel mexicano for dessert. Our server seemed a little nervous or inexperienced but was nice overall. We'll definitely go back and try the yummy things on the real menu. Just beware its on the pricey side."
0,"Overrated, food was just ok, service was spotty.\n\nWe had a large party (which increased in size by the time we reached the restaurant on a Sunday night) but the staff was friendly and rearranged things to accommodate our larger group.  With table shuffling and ordering tea (interesting variety of teas are served), it was more than an hour before our order was taken.\n\nThe food was uninspired and the serving size was average for a Chinese restaurant.  The restaurant managed to mess up several orders; one problem was solved quite nicely but another was not.\n\nAs we were leaving, a bordering-on-rowdy crowd was blocking part of the restaurant and entrance/exit and was drinking and smoking in front.  To their credit, the staff warned us about the problem, but it wasn't pleasant and it seemed like the staff had no control over the crowd.\n\nThis review is based on one visit while we were vacationing in Scottsdale."
1,"I'm a new local in Vegas and just getting used to all the stores.  I was so happy to find Glaziers.  The prices are extremely reasonable and their weekly deals are great.  Always pick up a coupon paper on your way in.  There are usually two free items when you purchase more than 25 dollars in groceries.  Anything from toothpaste to celery.  They also have great package deals where if you buy some meat you get a bunch of free stuff.  It's not high quality stuff, sprite, potatoes, onions, buns, etc...but it's free and great when you are on a budget.  I have had nothing but great interactions with the staff.  At the deli counter one of the ladies was actually cutting coupons for us so we were sure to get our discounts.  \n\nI saw someone posted that the produce is just a day away from being rotten.  I have not found this to be the case.  If you know how to inspect fruits and veggies, ie don't buy the greens that are yellow, it isn't a problem.  Everyone should know how to shop for veggies, if you don't, you probably shouldn't be a vegetarian.\n\nI'm going back right this moment...glad this place is close to me!"
0,"This is an \""OK\"" Greek place, but no where near the best. Our last few trips have been a big let down and I forgot to call an tell them so I'll tell all: the salads are $10 for a small portion of ragged old lettuce and a few pieces of chicken here an there. The gyro my husband had was also skimping on portion and the pita was hard! Their meals are also pricey in my opinion and you'll get crap fries, compared to the alternative My Big Fat Greek."
0,"I usually don't comment on service,\n\nBut this place was unforgivable, almost two hours before we got our appetizer, and over three hours for the whole meal... and we skipped dessert!!! I understand this is more a bar scene thing, but seriously a hamburger and some fries should not take over three hours!!!\n\nAnd on top of this, the food sucks. we had gnocchi lightly fried, and kobe beef burger.\n\nThe gnocchi was a disaster, no sauce and cuz it's fried it developped a crust which made is hard and tough, not really a good texture for gnocchi. the Kobe beef burger was ok, not worth the premium of Kobe, and it came without ketchup, took another half an hour and asking three times before i got it. And the third time I asked, she just went behind the counter picked it up and brought it straight to me!!! the ketchup was prepped already just there to pick up and bring it, and yet it took a so much wrangling to get something...\n\nI usually don't give out 1 or 2 stars cuz I'm not out to put businesses down but this place just rubbed me wrong."
0,"I think the service at Lowe's is consistently so much better then Home Depot, but this Home Depot is the closest home improvement store to where I live.  I went in today asking if they had free standing fans.  The women pointed at one type of box fan on an end cap.  I asked her if there were any others and her response was, \""No, it is August, what do you expect?  You should have bought one in June.\""\nYou know what i expect?  I expect a store to stock the things they sell, and not give me attitude when they don't have what I need, but I guess that is to much to ask of Home Depot."
0,I've been here about 10 times and I would have to say the quality has really dropped dramatically in the last month or so really disappointed I'll try back in a month or 2 because I really want to like this place
1,"I live around the corner from Bien Nails and I am so glad, because the staff is warm and friendly. The only complaint I have is of the constant attempt to \""up-charge\"" ($5 for this or that). \n\nEvery service I have had has been done with care, professionalism and quality. I would recommend them to anyone but remember to turn down the extras you don't need or the bill will get up there!"
1,My go to Mexican restaurant -- fabulous very attentive service . Spacious restaurant with a patio to sit outside on a gorgeous vegas day ! Try a banana/ raspberry swirl margarita. We love the chicken fajitas and the Zamora combo ( green chili pork guacamole burrito .. Yum) !!
0,It should it should be called china trash for the absolutely disgusting food.. Nothing but a whole bunch of Mexicans fighting over crabs  and shrimp will never come back hopefully I wont diarrhea warning stay away!!
1,"food was great, large portions. the server was very friendly and attentive. will definitely go again!"
1,"To be honest, I was a little dismayed when I opened their brunch menu and was faced with a list of 'complicated' choices. None of those straight up 'Two eggs with bacon and sausage' fare here, nope.  \n\nI tried to find the simplest thing to order, but everything looked equally elaborate and foreign. I was lost. So I settled on what sounded somewhat familiar, which now that I think of it, I must have once had for breakfast on a plane trip: breakfast burrito.\n\nWhen it arrived shortly after - this huge log of of a thing in the middle of a plate - my suspicion only grew larger. And then... all negative thoughts in my head went silent. The thing tasted fantastic! I couldn't believe it! I think my pupils dilated with excitement with each bite. \n\nI would have given the place five stars if it had not been for the slow-ish service when we got there. I think we sat idle without a menu, without any water, for a good 5 to 10 minutes before a waitress noticed us and signaled, \""I'll be with you in a sec.\"" Granted, the place was busy and they seemed understaffed.\n\nEverything else seemed fine though. The decor is hip and feels so 'right at home' with what the St. Henri neighbourhood is becoming. The white and blue landscape painting hanging on their wall is a great pick and very gorgeous. The price is comparable to what you'll be paying at popular brunch places in the Plateau. Definitely will drop by Mariani next time I'm in St. Henri."
1,"We were visiting Charlotte for the ACC Championship game, and my husband who does business a good bit in Charlotte, insisted on taking our group to Pinky's.  First off, the decor, the people, everything is just FUN!  The second we walked in and saw the artwork, the pinball machine, and the music blasting, I realized this was going to be awesome.  The burgers and hotdogs were very good, although smaller than what most people are probably used to.  The Fries with pimento cheese on them were a big hit with our table.   \n\nI had the white trash burger and the sweet potato fries, both were delish, although the fries could be split, they were large for a side.   Everyone at our table enjoyed their burgers and dogs.  I would definitely return!"
1,"I came here on date night with my boyfriend, and we were blown away! Our server Maria was awesome, she was super nice, and seriously was one of the best servers I've had in a while. \nWe started off with chips and guacamole, which were amazing... And I also ordered the skinny marg which was HUGE and equally awesome! We ordered the fajitas for two and it was super tasty and a TON of food. We will definitely be back!"
0,"I have tried this place 4 times. The food is not very good. I have lived in Thai Land but don't expect to get the same excellent food here. I love Thai food and Thai people, don't think much of this place, I live close by but go elsewhere. The food is bland, overcooked and pretty Americanized. I have always been pleasant, patient and courteous but never gotten good service. The servers are lazy and sometimes rude and you are going to wait a longtime for every step of the service process. With so many good Thai restaurants in Phoenix there is no reason to eat here."
0,"Paying for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant is absolutely ridiculous, especially when nothing was that good. Maybe they charge because its in the heart of yuppy Myers Park. Tacos were at most ok. Margaritas were overpriced and not good. Service was ok. Don't waste your time with this place as there are way better Mexican places in Charlotte."
1,"$49 for 2pm tee-time last Sunday (for the \""Mountain\"" course) which included cart and about 20 range balls.  Beautiful Arnold Palmer designed course -- ravines, lakes, elevations, pure greens with nary a weed to be found, picturesque views.  Maintenance was definitely a primary focus.  Fairways were tight, outlined by trees, bushes...quarry laced OBs.  If you hit OB, good as gone.  Every rock looks like your ball.  \n\nPace of play was not bad due to the horrible conditions.  It was so windy it was like playing behind the engines of a Boeing 747.  \n\nCountry club facilities and treatment (despite 2 of us being yellow!  the other 2 guys looked anglo-saxon so no trouble there).  Employees packed our cart before teeing-off and then wiped down our clubs once we finished."
1,"I come here for one thing...\n\n\nThe grilled chicken chimichangas with the red sauce on the side so i can use it for dipping.  I cannot tell you what is all in it but the grilled chicken alone is fantastic. Do i love the price for all of this...I guess.  Its not a stellar deal or anything but its like a once a month or every other month thing for me.  I love that the place gives you chips and salsa before your meal but i usually like to wait for my actual meal so i am not absurdly full from stuffing my face before hand.  \nBelieve me Chimichangas are not good later on so you have to have an appetite on you for sure.\n\nHorchata is okay. Not my favorite either seems too watery in my opinion, I love it when horchata is more on the creamy slightly sweeter side rather than watery and kind of sweet.  One guy that works here knows my friend who is hooked to this place and got me started so when we walk through he already knows.  The girl who cannot do her makeup for the life of her on the other hand is a different story."
1,"Let me tell you: I was very excited that there was a place solely dedicated to meatballs. Although I have limited exposure to homemade meatballs, I really enjoyed the meatballs from Emporio (Sienna Mercato). Their concept for their meatballs is equivalent to Subway. What I mean by this is that you get to choice every single step of your entree. You start off by choosing the type of meat, then the sauce, what type of vehicle you want your meatball to be in, and optional sides. I ordered the classic beef with marinara sauce as a meatball slider and got the tomato risotto as a side. The meatball itself was very large and I was full after the slider. My one complaint would be the tomato risotto. Unlike other risottos I have tried, I could tell that the rice had been par-cooked and then added to the sauce which is not how a traditional risotto is made. As a tip of the restaurant, I would not advertise \""tomato risotto\"" if it is not cooked in the risotto technique. Other than that, I would definitely go back and try the many combinations!"
1,"Excellent experience, every visit. When you come to the office everyone that works there is genuinely pleasant. They really make you feel at ease. Dr. Lok is no exception. In addition to being a kind and pleasant guy, he is also confident and self-assured. You have absolutely no doubt that you are getting excellent care.\nI'll let you experience the wonder of acupunture for yourself - but I will tell you my mood has not be this stable and positive in probably years."
1,"Yes, I'm a fan; 3rd time at this location.  One thing draws me back; POSOLE!!!  I love Posole, and the street tacos are the perfect size to go with the posole.  Only drawback is that I prefer cabbage to lettuce for the posole.  Many people do like lettuce, but save that for the garnish...LOL...The beans are very good, along with the carne asada tacos; they are small, but, are like the ones I remembered in Rocky Point.  Yes, I will be back!!! Posole!!! enough said..."
0,"After looking at all the Yelp reviews, I knew this place was either gonna be a hit or a miss. We basically just wanted a place to sleep since we were planning to be out pretty much the whole weekend. So we decided to go the economic route and gambled on this hotel. Well, let's just say, it was definitely a miss for us. Economic or not, we won't be coming back here again.\n\nPros: \n-Room cost is relatively cheap compared to other hotels. \n-I heard they renovated, so the rooms LOOKED decent. \n-Check-in and -out was pretty fast for us, BUT the line was quickly forming behind us. \n\nCons: \n-The bathroom sink's drain was closed and there was no way of opening it. The sink was quickly filling up with water we used to wash our faces. Gross.\n-The bathroom/shower was small and stuffy with no fans or windows.\n-The AC SUCKED. I woke up so many times throughout the night because I was so hot, not to mention, IT WAS LOUD. \n-They charge you $10 for resort fee PER NIGHT plus tax or whatever else they charged because my CC came back and it was $11.30 per night.\n-Not much of a resort. Our apt complex's pool was about the same size. I didn't bother going, but I could see it from our room. It was sad. I paid $22 for NOT using their crummy \""resort\"". Nope, you can't opt out. \n-$5 parking fee. You can get that back at the front desk when you check in, and they'll give you a parking permit."
1,"I'm not much of an Italian cuisine diner, unless it's my brother's in-law's family's cooking.  Their food is to die for.  So, i always compared Italian food to theirs.  Al Dente can cook up a great meal - from the appetizer to the main courses.  Wine selection is also good as they don't just have the expensive wine.  I like the fact that it was a very romantic and high star restaurant but yet inexpensive.  I was very impressed at how patient they were with us since it took us a while to order.  I was with one other person and it was a good dating experience.\n\nI chose a Raviolli dish and my date chose the spaghetti.  He always likes to compare spaghetti's and said that it was pretty good.  We also ordered this raw meat and I was a little apprehensive about eating it, but the appetizer was prepared very tastefully.  It was enjoyable.  \n\nI know I'd want to go back."
1,Fast. Good food. Awesome prices and even better lunch specials.
0,"My experience here Dr Hollis Underwood should thank me that I have only written negative complaints to her directly and now in yelp. The experience I had here would be worthy of a complaint to the medical board. \n\nI called to make an appointment to establish myself as a patient the Monday after Labor Day and was in need of an urgent visit as a follow up from an ER visit after a car accident. The first available appointment was December 3rd. \n\nI was forewarned that Dr Underwood doesn't limit her time with her patients to the 15 min insurance companies allow her to bill for and therefore requires her patients pay an additional $150 a year. On the phone I was told I could decide to pay this fee after my initial visit but that wasn't what happened when I got there. \n\nThere was a terrible wait. Then I wS taken back for some preliminary tests and brought back out to wait some more. \n\nI was given really unnecessary tests for someone in their 30s such as a bone density test, EKG and the list goes on. \n\nDr underwood was eager to diagnose me with several severe diseases none of which I even had adequate symptoms to consider an adequate concern she was dying to give me a Pap smear but I had seem my Gyno for my annual well woman exam the day before so that too was unnecessary. \n\nHer staff for the most part were short and abrasive and her scare tactics were disgusting and unappreciated. \n\nMost outrageous was that she ordered tests be sent to me to do at home and send back without ever discussing them with me. Unacceptable!!!\n\nShe doesn't contract with reputable medical facilities like medical imaging and instead has a mobile unit out of another state come to her office monthly. WTF???\n\nWhen I voiced my concerns to her in writing there was not even an attempt to apologize or clear up any confusion. She was simply happy to keep my $150 and who knows what she was collecting from my insurance and let me move on to the next doctor. \n\nI did immediately seek a second opinion and all of her serious concerns were found invalid at Scottsdale Healthcare. \n\nI always enjoyed the prizes in Cracker Jax boxes myself but I prefer my doctors licenses carry more credibility than the cracker Jax prizes.   \n\nRun, don't just walk away from this one and see any other doctor instead."
1,"By far THE BEST Walgreens I have ever gone to.  I've had the luxury of flying into Vegas the last two trips that I've taken.  This is great because I'm not spending hours in the car but it also sucks because I cannot bring more than 3 oz. of liquids on my flight unless I want to check my bags (that's a negative).\n\nCut to buying booze at this Walgreens.  It is a convenient walk from the Cosmopolitan where I stayed on the first trip.  We just took that bridge from the Cosmo to Walgreens for alcohol, Powerade, chasers, Pepto Bismol, candy, snacks, popcorn.  You name it, we bought it at this Walgreens.\n\nCut to the second trip in Vegas: we stayed at the Marriott Grand Chateau - also walking distance.  We pretty much did the same alcohol run.  However, on this trip, I did a haphazard job at packing and forgot my eyeliner.  No problemo.  This Walgreens has the BEST cosmetics section ever.  My friends hovered around the fragrance section and even ended purchasing the one named \""Between the Sheets\"" (made for an interesting talking point with cab drivers).  I picked up a great liquid eyeliner which has now replaced the Sephora one I was using before.\n\nThe line to check out looks really intimidating but here's a secret - you can check out that the register in the cosmetics area!  \n\nFrom here on out, I will be planning Vegas trips and where we stay in Vegas based on its proximity to this Walgreens.  Legit."
1,"It's a really big and quiet place, the crepes were made just like i was used to, with nutella. Their crepes were pretty good, not the best, but still pretty good."
1,If they get your order right you are in for some great Mexican food. Only thing in Vegas that makes me forget Tito's back home. 24 hour drive thru too!!!
0,"After the gym, Earl and I decided to pick up a smoothie at Protein House.  It was a very nice, clean.  Upon glancing at the blackboard, I don't see a list of juices so I inquired.  The not so friendly cashier said they only offer one juice, the Green Monster.  I chose Green Monster and Earl chose the Berry Blast Smoothie.  The ingredients used to make green monster includes spinach, coconut water, honey dew, pineapple, lime, ginger, cucumber, and kale.  Tasted like kale and spinach juice though.  There was no hint of sweetness from the fruits.\n\nEarl's berry blast smoothie, which we could only taste whey protein.  Overall, glad we tried it, so we know to get something different next time.  I like to try a place thrice before writing it off, therefore, Meh for now."
1,Great service all around.  Theses guys are awesome with fades and lineups.  I have been going here for one year.  I am really picky when it comes to my fades and lineups. I would recommend this place!
1,"I usually average 1 cracked windshield a year and have gotten my windshield replaced many times since moving here in Arizona. I have used several different companies, but SafePro has by far been the best windshield replacement company I've ever used. First off, setting up an appointment was super easy. Heather was very nice and helpful with getting filing a windshield claim to my insurance company. The technicians came to my office at work and completed the job in the parking lot. Later that day, I noticed that my windshield wiper wasn't completely lined up with the bottom of the windshield where they should rest at. Pete, the operations manager contacted me to follow up on the job, and immediately had a tech come by and fix it! I am extremely pleased with their customer service, especially with Heather, Pete, and Verna. When there was a small problem, they made sure to send someone back out to me and fix it! Those other windshield companies I've used in the past probably would have just denied it was their fault. Whereas SafePro promptly called me and said they will resolve the issue, and they did! I will DEFINITELY be calling SafePro again, when I need another windshield replacement. You've gained my business for life! Thanks you!!!\n-RM"
0,"Late at night and hungry, I discovered the Cambodian place down the street is a cash-only business. I chose this place because it was the only restaurant on the block with an open kitchen (many kitchens close at 10PM). Desperate times called for desperate measures, and I really should have taken the time to research a better restaurant.\n\nI ordered a seafood deluxe pasta dinner and chicken noodle soup. I was told it would take 10 minutes but it really took 30 minutes. I had planned on eating inside, but since it took so long, I asked for the meal to-go instead. By the time I got my food, I was pretty exasperated. The knot tying the bag was too tight, so I was unable to check the food; this meant I left without ensuring a fork was inside.\n\nThe food was very bad. I have no other way to put it. The pasta was completely tasteless. I know there was imitation crab in the pasta dish, but I can't decipher what else there was; I ate less than 10 bites. The soup was terrible, and I only had a few sips. The broth looked like Campbell's chicken noodle soup (except it looked like the same noodle as the pasta), but tasted saltier. The salad looked quite plain (seen better salads in an airport), but without a fork, I was unable to eat. The soup, salad, and pasta (with tip and tax) cost about $16, so I expect a decent meal at this price.\n\nI realize this is a pizza place and I should have ordered pizza, but I didn't want pizza. I also think if you're going to have a full menu, you should be able to properly present what's on the menu. I would've been better off ordering pasta from Pizza Hut. Attempting to eat pasta with a spoon didn't help either. Next time you're in the area, just skip this place."
1,"LOVE THIS PLACE! To start off.....It was my boyfriend's birthday and he's not one to like birthdays. Myself, being the event planner I am, wanted to make his birthday special and I wanted him to have an amazing time! So I got him a table at firehouse. \n\nWe get there, skipped the line and told the guy I had a table. He then called the manager over, Josh, and he SO kindly escorted us to our table and got us settled right in. He got me THE best table in the house over looking the whole club behind the bar! It was awesome!! Josh was so cool and consistently checked up on us. I don't know why some of the other reviews say he's rude cause he was SO nice and accommodating. At one point he even brought my whole party a round of shots on the house! Our cocktail waitress Robyn was even more awesome! She was the best host I've ever had at a table. Anything I needed she was there and on point. We had another girl there too but I cant remember her name. She was just as great and helpful. They made sure my boyfriend always had a drink in his hand. Oh and! we also had security at our table so randoms couldn't linger up in there. \n\nNeedless to say the night was awesome! I felt really well treated, the music was bumpin and my boyfriend had a GREAT time....success. I don't know why I don't do this every weekend?? It made me want to get a table every time I go there. \n\nThanks Firehouse!"
0,"Came here from LA for a day, and having had amazing food at my own mom'n'pop Cuban food spot at El Criollo and Havana Man\u00eda (shameless plugs for you Vegas peeps visiting the LA area), other than my abuela's house (que en paz descanse), I came here armed with great reviews from local folks (yeah, you guys!) and naturally high expectations... Aaaand left a tad disappointed. The only thing fresh we received was the bread (oh, soo good), the maduros, the guanabana shakes and the avocado salad. Our main course came so fast out of the kitchen after we sat down and ordered, we were amazed... Until I stuck my fork into my chicken fricas\u00e9 (spoiler alert: when I get it at my local spot, the meat is falls-off-the-bone delish!), not only did it not budge off the bone, it tasted like it had been re-heated, and parts of it had the texture of jerky. Not a sign of freshness. Lord knows I've cooked and reheated enough leftover meals in my day to know what happens to chicken when reheated in the microwave. My mom's meal, though it was very tasty, the one bite I had was less than lukewarm. All of these elements going downhill were disappointing, because of our waitress being so friendly and welcoming that it felt like I was coming to my family's house to eat. Though everything else was great, the two stars are strictly based on the main course."
0,"I live in Phoenix and have never been to either location of Chelsea's Kitchen before, but since I live so close to the airport, I thought I would give this place a try since I love Ingo's and this restaurant is part of the LGO Hospitality group. Upon arrival and requesting to be seated in the back so that I wasn't in the front under the florescents and throngs of travelers walking by, the reaction from the hostess was one of bewilderment and unhappiness, as she didn't want to seat us in what was supposed to be closed section, even though there were already people there. The excuse was that they were understaffed too. Not a very good impression to give to a new customer, but we ended up there anyway, go figure.\n\nSERVICE: our server, while she seemed a little frazzled, tried her best to be very attentive. Maybe it was the holidays or the short staffed situation or that she was possibly employed by the airport rather than directly by the restaurant that made her unhappy, who knows. Another server, maybe from the bar, poured my wine and spills a little in the process on the table, but had no desire to wipe it up. Really? You want me to clean up after your mess?\n\nFOOD: I was hoping that they would have the same menu as their other restaurant and was looking forward to ordering the Dixie pan-fried chicken, but it wasn't on the menu. So I opted for the meatloaf instead. Unfortunately, both the meatloaf and mashed potatoes were barely lukewarm and the broccoli was literally COLD and very under cooked (and I like crunchy veg); there was no way this dish came out of a hot pan or pot recently. And the meatloaf was dry and overcooked, lacking any kind of juiciness or color, just a block of brown meat in very little sauce. My dining companion's burger was hot, so I'm assuming my dish died in the window waiting for his dish. I wanted to send it back, but since our server didn't check on us for quite a while later and my companion was almost done with his burger, I didn't bother. Besides, the clock was ticking on my parking.\n\nWe dine out a lot and we have our local favorites so it's been a long time since I've tried a new restaurant and was very disappointed. It's not a great experience when you feel like you are being punished when you have done nothing wrong."
0,"Went here shortly after it opened. We had dinner and not sure if they were still training the wait staff and cooks, but it was not a good experience. May return to try the bar, but it will not include dinner."
0,"Me and my boyfriend went out for what we hoped would be a great date night, we decided on Ishi based on the reviews, everything was horrible! I ordered the squid salad which I swear is the same exact one sold at Harris teeters sushi section, then we got an Alaskan roll and an eel roll, the Alaskan was OK but the eel roll was seriously skimpy on the eel, it also had a funny aftertaste. The ginger had a nasty chemical/soapy taste. For dinner my bf ordered steak & chicken ramen which was super greasy and the steak was well done and not the md. rare he asked for. I ordered the ishi steak also well done not md. like I requested, it was just so bland and greasy. The only good thing on my plate was the carrots. The service left alot to be desired as everyone was gathered around the TV watching American idol our waiter only checked on us once and never refilled my drink. I'm not sure if this place has just gone down hill in recent months or the other reviewers like greasy bland food, its about an hour later and me and my bf both have stomach aches, I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!!!!"
1,"Delicious baby back ribs. Beef brisket was ok. Pulled pork mmm. Half chicken good too. Everything was delicious. Mac and cheese is actually homemade not some boxed crap, must try. Definitely plan on returning. Ordered to go so next time probably eat there."
1,"Arrived at Tix 4 Tonight Sunday morning around 9:30AM to get tickets to see the Jabbawockeez at the Monte Carlo and was very pleased with the prices that Tix 4 Tonight displayed on their LCD monitors - it was a huge discount compared to how much the tickets would have cost me had I bought online at VEGAS.com or directly from the Monte Carlo ticket booth. \n\nI'm assuming that because we were at the box office so early there wasn't a huge line so keep that in mind. The staff was friendly and definitely didn't try to push us to see a specific show; they did however, have a package for discounted buffets if you're interested in that. \n\nOverall, service was fast and friendly. i'll definitely come back again to Tix 4 Tonight when I want to see a show in Vegas."
0,"Tried this place today, as I noticed it was new and in my neighborhood, and unfortunately it was mediocre at best. \n\nI ordered a soup and salad for lunch, which was supposed to come with garlic bread, but they never brought it (and I did not ask).  The soup was their \""soup of the day\"" - chicken, cheddar and bacon.  Unfortunately it was very bland and had a poor texture.  The salad was clearly bagged salad that had not been picked through very well, as it had pieces mixed in that were past their expiration.  Also, the root piece from a heart of romaine lettuce was somehow mixed in as well.  The balsamic dressing that came with it seemed like bottled dressing - not very fresh or notable. \n\nThe couple seated next to me offered their waiter some \""constructive criticism\"" on their meals, as they were disappointed in whatever they had as well.  The only reason I did not give this one star is the wait staff was very pleasant and the food came out fairly quickly.  \n\nI wish I had found a new fabulous place in Desert Ridge to visit, but I do not think I will be back."
0,"So disappointing!!! Came in because I heard great things, read awesome yelp reviews, and the menu online was enticing. We had monorail passes so getting there was easy. My husband and I both decided on the hash since it's what they're famous for. I'm a foodie and almost always order what a place is known for.... it's supposed to be the best choice, right? WRONG! First of all, the hash is not a hash, beware hash lovers. It is large chopped crispy potatoes with stuff on top. I got the corned beef hash, and it was literally breakfast potatoes with shredded beef on top. I was hoping for the delish smushy goodness of everything cooked together in a hash.. and it totally fell short. It was also served in a cast iron skillet that it wasn't even cooked in. What I really wanted was their vegetable \""hash\"" with corned beef added to it. But they wouldn't let me... which I found strange. They said I could remove things but couldn't add anything. I didn't care if it cost more, I just wanted veggies with my hash. But nope. I also ordered they're \""famous\"" blt bloody mary which also fell short. It was watery from the first sip, and I really didnt understand the giant lettuce and tomato in it. To top it off my hash arrived incorrect, 3 times. The poached egg, although cooked in water, was cooked to a rock. It came with a biscuit when I asked for unbuttered toast. And then the toast arrived with butter. I'm allergic to dairy so there really wasn't any ignoring it... The server asked to take it back again but my husband's would have gotten cold.\n\nThe two stars are for the glass that I got to keep from my drink and for the server taking my meal off the check. Unfortunately, I don't understand the hype this place gets and I won't be coming back..."
0,"Ten members of my family made reservations for Sunday brunch today for mother's day! Horrible experience for service and especially the food! First off for 35 dollars per person their hardly was any food out, and what was out was dried out and hardly edible. So right off the bat 3 people in our party decided against doing the brunch because of how bad it looked so they ordered from the menu. I would love to tell you how that was but they never received their food. The rest of us still tried the brunch because the waitress promised more food...nothing got better even down to not having any plates. They weren't even busy so I don't know what happened with that. Worst part was we told the waitress how we felt and I'm sure she could see how displeased we were and didn't even offer to make things right...so after 230.00 Bill we left hungry and angry. By the way at least 2 different customers were nodding their head and felt how we did...do yourself a favor pay 10 bucks more and hit up the Phoenician for mother's day brunch."
0,"With so many VW dealers in the valley, I would have to recommend avoiding Chapman in Scottsdale. I used them since they are close to my home otherwise there is no compelling reason to use this dealership.\n\nSales -- actually the sales guys were very cool and low pressure, I had a newer person. No bad at all. Quick and friendly.\n\nService -- this is the key problem at this dealership, the service dept staff treat the customers poorly and are definitely rude. You know that attitude, you bought your new car, its fine, any problems are in your imagination! Which is never the case, new cars need some tuning and tweaking. Anyway, perhaps buy your car here and then service at another Scottsdale or Phoenix dealership!?\n\nSo despite a good experience with sales, the service dept brings everything down. And since you will deal more with the service dept than sales, I would shop for your new VW elsewhere."

1,"I have been shopping at Woodman's East forever. When I lived in Stoughton, I schlepped all the way there, as it was totally worth it. Now I live fairly close by and I am there at least twice per month.\n\nI am something of a food snob but I just can't justify paying $8.99/lb for Brussel sprouts at Willy St when they are $1.99/lb at Woodman's. I want to buy local to support the farming community but I just can't afford the disparity. Woodman's has expanded its organic section of the store and I buy many fresh, canned and frozen items from that area. I find their produce to be quite satisfactory.\n\nThe store is clean, well-stocked and the staff quite helpful. Yes, it is warehouse-like. This is no Hy-Vee with the many smiling faces but Woodman's is utilitarian and affordable. It does not pretend to be a restaurant or coffee house. It is a supermarket.\n\nThat said, I spend plenty of money at Jenifer St Market, the Co-Op and at the farmers market as well. Jenifer St sells local produce at a very reasonable price. I spread my food dollars around but Woodman's probably garners about 65% of my food budget.\n\nI am saddened to see the reduction of foreign workers. I do see an increased number of African-American staff which I think is a wonderful thing. Automated check-out areas are taking over the role of the cashier. I hate those things and much prefer waiting on-line so I can thank a  human for providing good service. \n\nOkay, i can't end this review without a nod to the liquor store. Oh, yeah, love that place.\n\nGo shop and then treat yourself to a bottle of Tito's vodka. You earned it."
1,This is by far the best car wash I've ever been. They always do their job properly. I have to admit it may take longer time if there is line waiting. Last time the guy there advised me to do a mini detail and he did a great job. I live in California but every time I'm in town I go to this place before I go back home. My car literally look new again it's like it had a spa.
1,"Best airport restaurant that I have ever seen.  Something for everyone, my wife had an awesome salad, I had a Cuban sandwich, while my son had a wood-fired pizza.  Clean, affordable, and inexpensive.  They made a mistake on my Cuban and gave us a free red velvet cupcake.  An airport establishment that is concerned with customer service???  What a pleasant surprise.  If you are in this terminal, this is the place to be!"
0,"Was just in there, solo, to chill out, eat some pizza, drink some wine and hang out. \n\nRandom drunk dude (at 8:30pm) approaches me and asks me if I want a shot of Jack (no). Proceeds to harass me about my haircut and ask me if I know his homeless buddy who, also, is from Seattle. \n\nThen he asks me if I have a problem with him? \n\nPizza to go please!\n\nI called the bartender after I left and told him he had a problem on his hands with that guy and he seemed receptive but, honestly, he should have sniffed that problem out right away.\n\nShit shouldn't get that weird in a place like that. There were families in there and I'm sure they weren't looking for a guy like that around them. \n\nFull disclosure; I like to party and I do like to drink and be inappropriate... a lot. Just not in someplace like that. Ain't nobody got time for that when there are kids around.\n\nPizza was OK out of a box at home. Drank a beer and jumped in the pool."
1,"atmosphere was very nice. we got there at about 7 and the place started filling up a little after. the portions are on the bigger side, so if you're not a big eater, i would recommend for you to share your dish.\n\ni got the meatball pizza to weight my stomach down with some meat and carbs. the crust was thin and crunchy with some scattered meatballs. it came out to be about a 10\"" medium pizza, so i was only able to finish 2/5th of the pizza. the rest was devoured at 4am, and it was still good!\n\nthe pastas were pretty large as well as all my friends were not able to finish their dish. i got to pick at the lasagna, which was my 2nd choice and was glad i didnt chose it. it was a bit on the bland side for me. however, their puree mushroom with cheeses and truffle oil was delicioussss. the waiter had dropped the remaining 2 slices of that pizza when he was boxing it up and gave us a whole new pizza. unfortunately, that pizza was not so good at 4am.\n\ngreat service, nice atmosphere, good food. i would come back."

0,"This place could be great if the service wasn't so rude. No one seems to care, and they never say thank you. Each time I've been here one of the little girls working at the counter has looked me up and down judgementally. \n\nThe coffee was fine, but the cookie I had was wayyy too sweet for me. \n\nIf you want to feel good about yourself, don't go here!"
0,"Yes, pizza from Brooklyn, is brand/location advertising that is attractive to a pizza lover.\n\nEven the interior decor of b/w framed poster is unmistakably New York New York; it is homey and warm without the crowd and the lines of a neighborhood pizzeria.\n\nA \""Hello\"" when I walked-in was very welcoming and they had ESPN on so the sporty feel was nice too.\n\nAnd then the order...\n\nMy spaghetti sauce is weak and watery; maybe it's just me but I want my tomato to be on the creamy, if not fresh and homemade (it does not help when they have the BIG can of tomato sauce on DISPLAY next to the counter). On the bright side, I think the pasta is texturally good and the meatball is a big ball of fun worth trying again.\n\nI've never tried their pizza but it looks big and cheesy thin. You can get two slices and a drink for _____.\n\nAnd then the bathroom...\n\nSeeing it was not very busy when I was there, I wished the staff were more mindful on their cleaning, because unfortunately this would be the last thing I will remember about this place."
0,"Somewhere on the NY NY website I saw a promotion for BOGO breakfast here if you stay at NY NY which we were.  I made a reservation a couple weeks before even though I figured we probably wouldn't need it on a weekday.  We didn't but there was a nice table waiting for us on the Patio.\n\nI ordered the corn beef hash for $10.99.  It came with sliced potatoes and chopped corn beef on top along with two poached eggs, and a fried polenta cake.  Breakfast is also served with warm french bread.\n\nI did not care for the corn beef which was dry.  The potatoes were undercooked and overall the dish was very rich and greasy.  The polenta cake was tasteless and rubbery... I didn't understand the concept of it at all... and the poached eggs were cooked to perfection, the saving grace of my breakfast.  Also, the bread was very good and the real butter was high quality.  I was dissapointed...\n\nMy hub ordered the french toast for $9.99 and said it was pretty good, nothing fancy... but he'll eat anything and I was not interested in trying it.\n\nThe coffee was excellent and refills kept coming, as they should for $4.50 !!!\n\nOur server was nice and started out attentive but ticked me off when he took the order of two tables near us that were seated after us............. my pet peeve for sure.  So of course they got their food before us and that just isn't OK with me.  He didn't neglect us otherwise so that was nice.  And the lady pouring the coffee was on it!  Loved that!\n\nI won't be back for breakfast but based on the pics posted on Yelp I do want to try them for dinner... we shall see..."
1,"The first time I found myself at Rose & Crown was at the beginning of an all day pub crawl downtown. The fish and chips were a GREAT way to start the day as they were everything I expected from an English/British/Whatever pub. The only downfall to this place is the bathroom situation. There's one women's bathroom (that I know of) which can suck on a Saturday night. BUT the beer selection is always pretty legit and they have root beer which most bars don't serve (if you haven't tried root beer and vanilla vodka, you're missing out)! I've managed to wind up at Rose & Crown several other times, mostly at the end of the night, and it tends to be pretty consistent. The staff has always been great and the patio/front porch area is one of my favorite places to be in Phoenix!! Love!"
1,"Lovely place to have a nice dinner.  We were here for the Christmas Eve dinner.  The place was packed with people enjoying themselves.  \n\nWe were seated right away but the waitress did not come over for at least 5 min.  We didn't think it was a big deal but as the night progressed, it got worse...it's understandable though I guess...you know, with tons of customers that night.\n\nWe started off with glasses of wine, calamari and french onion soup.  The calamari was very fluff and tasteful with huge portions enough for 2,3 people.  My fiance loved his french onion soup so much that he didn't share enough with me haha.  \n\nThen we had the ribeye and filet with sauteed asparagus and Mastro's mashed potatoes.  The ribeye was very tasteful and tender with right amount of fat.  The filet was seasoned very well and also tender.  I must say though that we still prefer Ruth Chris's filet over Mastro's.  The size of the meats were HUGE that we couldn't even finish half of them.  \n\n*Location = very nice, right next to Scottsdale Fashion Square\n*Food = amazing but be ready to bring back half of your dinner with you home.\n*Service = not so good that night but I think she still did her best. We thought it was interesting how Ruth Chris's waiters in comparison are much  more professional.\n*Ambiance = very chic but not so romantic"

0,"Now typically, you know what to expect from Motel 6...which isn't a whole lot. \n\nThis one took the cake though when I walked in the office and was blasted in the face by the cigarette stench.  Not to mention the pregnant girl that had marks all over her arms...and each arm bandaged.  \n\nThe service wasn't great either.  I arrived about an hour and a half prior to 3 p.m. which is check-in.  Okay, my room wasn't ready yet, no big deal.  We left, got something to eat and came back, just about at 3.  Back into the office, she proceeded to tell that she had to find a ready room...wait what?  Then told me that the room wasn't ready yet.  \n\nI made the reservations online about a month ago, they could've at least had the room ready by 3.\n\nAnd walking on a linoleum wood floor isn't really the most comfortable thing after getting out of the shower.  \n\nAnd to top it all off (not that this couldn't happen anywhere else) but a car alarm kept going off several times during the night.  Not exactly the best nights sleep is guaranteed here either.\n\nCheck please?"
1,"Holy crap! Was completely surprised by this little joint. The $8 for $14 worth of food yelp coupon is redeemable by smart phone, so you can buy it on the spot. \n\nGot the veggie burrito bowl - I don't say this often,  but this would have been just as good without the cheese. There was so much going on that it wouldn't have been missed. Meal was a touch salty, but otherwise delicious. My husband highly recommended the carne asada.\n\nService was a bit slow for lunch, and the music selections are a bit off-putting.  Otherwise, five stars."

Sweet! The drinks were a bit overpriced but come on, it's vegas baby! Really nice bit set up. Loved the background outside waterfall wall. Really cool good looking people that come here. We met a ton of fun nice hot people and held a couple tables with. The staff and hostess were really helpful, but why wouldn't they be you know???? Not all of the outdoor tables were sold out. We actually left to bounce around and came back here at the end of the night before the after-after party lol. They were really cool. Overall made my Vegas trip a fun time!"
0,"This review is only for the spa itself, did not get a treatment or massage. The facility looks great from the outside, though not so amazing inside. The men's area is rather small, all the advertising about the largest spa is mostly their use of space, not a large bountiful spa itself. Only one jacuzzi which is rather small and only has a jet in the middle. The wet sauna was ok once they got it working. The others were pretty basic and I fully expected much more. I would highly recommend Caesar's as it's much more expansive and varied in it's options. Must say that the service is 5 stars though. Attendants were very helpful and there at every turn, probably since it was pretty slow."

0,"True to my Texas upbringing, I have always been a big fan of barbeque. There's nothing more satisfying than a perfectly smoked rack of ribs or a tender and juicy beef brisket. ---  Neither of these will you find at Buzz BBQ.\n\nReally lazy barbeque joints boil their meat before smoking it for a brief period to try and give it that smoky flavor. \n\nThey may serve it with barbeque sauce on the side, but it is by no means a dry rub or anywhere near slow-smoked. The meat is tender, to be sure, but that's what happens when you boil the meat to death. Despite my best efforts, I could not determine what method they used to get their nasty smoke flavor, but it tastes like it was finished over a bed of burning dead animal carcasses.\n\nTo me, great barbeque tastes incredible without any sauce (unless of course you are talking about Carolina style barbeque) and you add the sauce to add that little extra flavor. Buzz BBQ needs to be drowned in sauce to mask that nasty taste their meat gets from their smoking method.\n\nOh, and in case you're not disappointed enough with the food, they'll be sure to kick you in the head with the bill - because no disastrous dining experience is complete without a double-blow to the stomach and the wallet."
0,"A few friends and I had a reservation at 7:30 last Saturday at Pasta Brioni. The restaurant was busy - it seems like a popular spot for snowbirds.  \n\nEven though we had a reservation, we weren't sat at a table until 7:45. At this point, we realized how disorganized the staff was - we had random mis-matched silverwear (at a table with four of us, it took them 10 minutes and 3 tries to get an almost complete set of silverwear - meaning a fork, a knife, a spoon and a side plate - for everyone at the table.) We also didn't get a menu for almost 15 minutes. \n\nDefinitely some issues with the service. Although we sat at 7:45, our server didn't take our order until 8:15. It took almost 20 minutes for our appetizer salads to arrive, around 8:35. After we finished our salads, it was another 30 minutes before we had our main courses - they didn't arrive until after 9:10. At this point we were starving, the server tried to make light of the situation - apologizing for the delay and joking that he bet we had time to work up an appetite. \n\nThe food was very mediocre - not terrible, but nothing special. In my opinion, definitely not worth the hour wait. They also didn't get all of our orders right - my friend had ordered a pasta dish with chicken, only to have it come out without chicken. Another friend was very disappointed with her meal and barely touched it, she didn't complain but I was surprised they didn't offer to bring her something else or take it off the bill. \n\nWe were all laughing about what a disappointing 2-hour experience it was from start to finish - we won't be back!"
0,"Oh Hubert Keller, I am so disappointed. The actual space - decor and ambiance - of Fleur is great. And the service is great. Beyond that, it was, ever so sadly, not good and a total waste of money and taste buds.\n\nThanks to Restaurant.com, I had a $25 gift certificate for here. So I figured that was my excuse to finally try Fleur, which had been on my list \""want to eats\"" for awhile. We sat at the bar, shared a cocktail and two of the small plates.\n\nThe cocktail we ordered ($15) was a Georgia Moon. Tasty, but too sweet and thick. And it was definitely on the small side. Not worth $15. 3 stars.\n\nFor the two small plates, we ordered the french onion soup shooter ($7) and lobster mac 'n' cheese ($18). The amount of truffle oil in the shooter glass was overwhelming. And the soup tasted very little like french onion. While a cool concept, the actual taste was a let down. 1 star. The mac 'n' cheese was bleh. The actual lobster pieces were chunky and great - better than most every other lobster I've had in a lobster mac 'n' cheese. However, the mac and the cheese were so bland and undesirable. Despite being hungry, I opted to leave half the dish uneaten. 1.5 stars.\n\nI so wanted to love this place. But alas, the food just didn't deliver. Many options sounded tasty. So maybe there are some good menu items here and we just chose poorly? But based on what we had, I'm not sure I'd be willing to risk the money to try anything else."
0,"I don't know what possessed me to eat here.  Maybe I thought if it was good enough for George Dubya, it would be good enough for me.  I expected grease, I expected a lackluster interior, and I expected mediocre food.  I guess it met my expectations.\n\nBecause nothing is too good for my husband's wife, he chose the \""presidential\"" table for us, complete with the \""hasn't been cleaned since 2004 presidential plaque.\""  Chips and salsa arrived promptly.  The chips were thin and crispy, but far too greasy.  The salsa was not the greatest either.\n\nI ordered a chimichanga deciding it was going to be my last fat-laden meal for at least a month, or a week, whichever comes first, because I wanted the crispy tortilla.  Unfortunately, only the very ends of it were crispy.  The rest was drenched in sour cream and some pretty seriously bad gray-green guacamole which made the whole thing soggy.  What a sad waste of the deep-frying process.  Inside was green chile, made with beef, rather than my favored pork.  It wasn't too bad, but from what spilled out, I could see there was far too much grease in it.  Not that I was expecting healthy here, but this was ridiculous.  I almost didn't eat it, but I did.\n\nWould I come back?  It's not at the top of my list, but if I say no, I'll end up there next week.  I did see they have pretty good drink specials, and the place was quite busy, so someone must like it more than I do."

Other people around us were sitting up to 15 minutes before being served or being asked for a drink..not even WATER! Other servers walked by, but if it was not their section they did not stop for help. Same went for us. After we ordered, we waiting an additional 20 minutes for our beers which were poured earlier and our food had the taste of heat lamp.\n\nMy wife and I will most likely not return."

Penne vodka, bolognese, fettucini carbonara...all the amazing dishes I miss from back home in NJ....\n\nThe only downside is that I know I've gained a few pounds since I started coming because I just can't resist those rice balls!  :)"
0,"There's a real disconnect between the food, price and atmosphere of this place. The 4oz burgers start at 11$ with a not so good salad (which can't be swapped for fries even at a premium)...so really you're looking at at least 18$ for a 4oz burger with fries...21$ for 6oz. I will say the burger is quite good, with the homemade bun being the standout here, but the place feels like any old pub. I think they need to figure out what kind of burger spot they want to be to create a consistent dining experience. As a friend said, \""It's no surprised they're dead on a Saturday night.\"""
0,"This is a really unique place. If you just want to hang out and have drinks in January, this may be a great option. However.....My co-workers and I tried to have lunch at Duce during the week because we had heard the sliders were scrumptious. We ordered lunch at 11:30AM and left with no food at 12:30PM. The kitchen is just too small and disorganized to produce meaningful amounts food during lunch hour. There was also no evidence of any management on site. Waiting for an hour without A/C for no food was a real downer and has soured our opinion of this joint. Triple D got hoodwinked on this one."

1,This is a great place if you aren't a steak person and you enjoy seafood. The shrimp cocktail and lobster bisque are delicious. I also really like the shrimp and scallop saut\u00e9. The ambiance is beautiful. And I really like the manager over there. He is really friendly and remembers you. \n\nCons: the crab that they use for the crab cake or on the crab wedge salad is not good. It's not lump and has a filler that is not very good.
1,"The main reason we seek out Hot Dog on a Stick is for...the lemonade!  It's perfectly sweetened and refreshing on a hot day.  While we tend to go for the regular lemonade, we have also tried the cherry lemonade.  And you know what?  It's all good!  I wish Hot Dog on a Stick was near where I live!  When we head to the Southwest, a trip to Hot Dog on a Stick is a must-do.  \n\nYes, we've tried the hotdogs and liked them.  However, while good, we don't long for them when we're home.  The lemonade is another story!\n\nThe Hot Dog on a Stick in the Fiesta Mall has never disappointed us.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  One time I asked for a small empty cup to pour a little lemonade in it in order to take some medication that has to be added to a small amount of liquid.  The staff gave me a cup without giving me a hard time or charging me any money for it.\n\nIn conclusion, if you haven't tried the lemonade, I highly recommend that you do so!"
0,"We went in with a party of  four adult, 3 kids and 1 baby on 6/4/14. First of all the party was not helped right away, there was no wait as it was 9 PM. We had to ask for a high hair four times, and it finally arrived. We also had to wait for crackers which never arrived. The server was ok' but the other help was not there. The kids food came out at different times. The adult food was not cooked all the way through on the burger. The birthday cupcake was dried out and crunchy. We paid 93.54 for our meal not including tip. It was awful. We had to wait for boxes, refills and napkins after a spill. The staff was so into their conversations and cleaning that  the few tables in the establishment were ignored. The pest part is the guests on the receipt list four, hum? Time of close out was 10:39 and the ticket number is 30035."

0,"First of all, I can't even give this place 1 star. Is there such a thing as a negative star? We were there around 5:30 pm on a weekday night (Tuesday) to have dinner. We stood at the front of the podium for about 5 minutes before anyone decided to show up and ask us what we wanted. I told him that we wanted dinner and he said to sit anywhere since there was only 4 other people in the entire 1st floor. After being seated, the waitress finally came over and brought menus and asked if we wanted anything to drink. We ordered a GIN martini on the rocks with olives and a draft beer. Atleast 10 minutes later the waitress came back without the drinks and told us they didn't have any olives. We said its OK and she left. About 5 minutes later she brought back a red drink in a glass with a draft beer in a plastic cup.  I asked what was the red drink ? She said they also didn't have any vermouth for the martini and she would ask the bartender what kind of drink it was. She came back and told us that it was SloeGin with Tanqueray Gin. I told her that was unacceptable and just bring Gin on the rocks. Unbelievable, and this is suppose to be a bar. The next surprise was the food we ordered. I ordered Fish Tacos with 1/2 onion rings and french fries. She ordered Fish and Chips with french fries/onion rings with a salad. The food was inedible. Eveything was deep fried in a batter that was disgusting. I could go on and on about how bad the food was, but I'm done talking about it. The last surprise was the final bill. They actually charged $11.25 for GIN on ice. And my draft beer in a plastic cup they charged $4.00. What a ripoff. I will never go back to this DIVE and I certainly will tell everyone I know about this place.  If you go, you are on your own. I'm surprised that I didn't get sick with the little food that I ate."
0,"I went there for lunch on my twenty first birthday and the food was delicious, service not so much. I don't know if it is because I am young and she profiled us as going to leave a small tip but we even dropped it was my twenty first a couple times and not even a happy birthday was said. I have gone with friends previous years to other locations and had meals partially paid for and desserts free and I know your not suppose to expect and I wasn't but this felt like horrible service and I was disappointed."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE!\nAfter two months of going back and forth with their billing manager, I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED so awful!\nTHEY WILL CHARGE you $$ for things not disclosed or discussed. \nI saw the Dr for a good 4 minutes and now I am getting screwed. \n FOLLOW MY ADVICE GO TO  Valley Women for Women OBGYN or any others...  \nthis place is not professional and you will end up with hefty bills that are not disclosed."
1,"Went here to meet up with some friends. They have a nice outdoor seating area with TVs so we could keep up with the NCAA game that was playing. They have a good selection of beer, however, I was disappointed with their specialty drink selection. Only a few to choose from and none of them were too appealing. I tried the one that I thought looked the best, but ended up sending it back and just decided to order beer. But it was a good place to meet up with a group so I would recommend it."
1,"Ever since I moved to Las Vegas from California in 2004, I've been looking for Mexican food restaurants that remind me of home. Even though it has always been against my best judgement, I had to settle for the inferior Roberto's. Settle no more. \n\nI work at a school up the street from Molcasalsa and surprisingly I never ventured in until yesterday. I ordered a carne asada burrito and 3 rolled tacos with guacamole. While I waited for my order, I filled up ramekins with molcajete, red, and green salsas. \n\nMy order arrived after a few minutes and I started with the burrito. The beef was tender, the pico de gallo bright and fresh, and the guacamole was silky smooth. I loved the taquitos, too, covered in creamy guacamole and cheese.\n\nWhat surprised me was the restaurant's namesake, the molcajete salsa, was my least favorite part of the meal. However, both the red and green salsas make up for it in the taste and spiciness categories. \n\nI'm giving this restaurant 5 stars because the food is great, and great Mexican food is rare in Las Vegas."
1,Primarily chose this place because they delivered. Ordered sweet and sour chicken and was pleased with it along with speedy delivery.  I would try this place again and would recommend to friends.
0,"Sorry to say it, but the Urbana Farmers Market is overpriced. I cannot imagine spending $3.00 a pound for string beans, for example. Tomatoes are also priced at $3.00 a pound even when the vendors' tables groan with them in August. New York's Union Square greenmarket is cheaper! Of course there's that airfare...\n\nI go once in a while to buy zucchini, onions, and garlic and to get tomatoes from vendors who sell the ones with blemishes for $2.00 a pound or less. If you poke around you can find some bargains, but this is the most expensive farmers market I've ever been to unfortunately."
1,"Great, fast service and Dennis, the owner, is really friendly. Will use them for all my alterations!"
0,I went once and was very unimpressed.  Since I live in walking distance I decided to go back and just get a quesadilla and a beer.  Who could mess that up right?  I had to laugh when my corona tasted skunky and quesadilla was so bad I only had one slice.  You need to have very very low standards to enjoy this place.
0,Horrible sums this place up! Stale bread with stale toppings. I will not give them a second try.
0,"This place charged $20 for an exterior only wash of a sub-compact vehicle, not including tip.\n\nThe sign outside the cashier clearly says $11 but that's a lie and the owner refused to acknowledge the posted prices.\n\nI won't be back.\n\nUpdate: After I mentioned the $20 charge to one of the workers in the drying area and pointed out it didn't include the tip, he went and talked to the owner, who then gave me a refund of the overcharge. Why not charge the right amount up front?"
1,"Food: I heard so many great things about Tao so I had high expectations for the food. I ended up ordering the mongolian scallion chicken which was very tasty. I wish portions were a little bigger though. I also tried the squab lettuce cups which I loved! They have a nice selection on their menu and also daily specials.\n\nPrice: Prices here are expensive. My dish was about $27 or so and my appetizer was around $15, I think. You're really paying for the atmosphere.\n\nService: Service is outstanding here. We dined here early but there were plenty of waiters taking care of us. They were all polite, well mannered and very on top of their stuff.\nAlso you can make reservations on Opentable.com but if you are planning on dining on a Friday or Saturday night...make them at least a month or so in advance!\n\nAtmosphere: I loved it. We dined upstairs. Considering that we were here for an early dinner, it wasn't loud or anything. Very relaxing actually. I would love to see the night club next time. The entrance here is also beautiful. There are rose petal baths! I would love to come here to celebrate a birthday or something.\n\nLocation: Located right in the Venetian near the exit of the Venetian canal shops."
0,"After reading so many great reviews I was excited to try this place, we passed by it a hundred times because it shares the shopping plaza with our favorite Chicago-style pizza place, Amore. We dined in on a week night, we were told booths were reserved but we had our choice of table. We got seated and looked over the menu, we narrowed down our selections and waited, and waited, and waited for someone to take our order.\n\nFinally, our server appeared, we wanted a few rolls: Kiss Me, Lisa Lisa, and WSOP.  She told us not to choose Kiss Me, she says many don't like it. She suggested GT-R, instead. Fine by us, our diet cokes were soon delivered. They had an odd taste, like peppermint or something. Our rolls arrived and we dug in, it was only the WSOP roll we were fond of, it had yellowtail and jalapeno. We were still hungry, but we asked for the check, we were put-off by this point. Our total was $40 for two drinks and three rolls. The rolls were not worth $12.50, pricey, especially to leave hungry... I'll stick to Hokaido Sushi, it's closer to home, tastier and a better value. I paid the tab, and my husband placed an order for a pizza. So, we did not go hungry, but it was an expensive appetizer."
0,"I never even got to go in this bar and this is exactly why I gave them 1 star. Their customer service is absolutely horrible. We had a group of 19 people. First off, I emailed the contact info (like it says to do for parties) a week before we came to Vegas. Never got a response. Strike 1. We get the whole group up to the bar, my husband and I used the restroom, we get back to the bar to pay (the rest of our group paid already). The stupid girl at the register says, and with attitude, \""it's going to be a half hour wait.\"" I said, we are with this group right here, the group you are letting in right now\"" She looks at me with her pissy attitude and goes \""I don't care, it's going to be a half hour wait\"" so i said \""F**K that\"" and just left. So we never got to go in with our group, who wasn't impressed with the bar by the way, but we were able to enjoy ourselves elsewhere for  a LOT cheaper. I'm just upset we weren't able to spend that time with our friends for my friend's birthday"
1,"When passing through Phoenix last week, we had dinner here on the recommendation of Yelp. Who knew you could get good British pasties in Tempe?\n\nThe pasties themselves were incredible. I had the bangers and mash, the wife had the chicken tikka masala. We loved each of them, and believe me that one pasty is enough to satisfy a big appetite.\n\nWe were not as huge fans of the fries/chips. Also, the waitress really had no idea about any of the beers on the menu. Since I am not knowledgable about British beer, this led me to order something I didn't really care for. Next time (oh yes, there will be a next time) I'll stick with the Lagunitas IPA."
0,"I think one star is too good for this place.  All too often, when I order anything fried, it has such a bitter, horrid taste to it, that I'm convinced they don't change their grease out enough or don't clean the fryers properly.  I ordered cheese tots and could only stomach two.  It's a half hour later, and the horrible taste is still in my mouth.  This is how our food comes out at least 80% of the time, and I will never, never, NEVER order any food from this Sonic as long as I live."
0,"I have heard so many AMAZING things about this place and though I have tried this place over & over again. I cant seem to enjoy eating here at all.  \n\nEvery single time I have been brought here by friends who loved this restaurant, it has always been at least a 30-40minutes wait. Which I normally dont mind at all but waiting for something that I dont enjoy afterwards does not seem that it was worth waiting at all.\n\nI dont remember what I ate because I let my friends that has been here order for me but of all the plates I tasted nothing stood out and nothing blew me away. I, also finally tried the honey toast that A LOT of people rave about, but it highly disappointed me.  maybe is because i did not like the honey taste or the texture of the honey toast, but it didnt taste that great either. \n\nI guess Ichiza isnt for everyone."
0,"Went to watch the Hockey game at 6:15pm. At 8pm we were forced to pay 5$ each to carry on watching as there was a Bikini contest going on. I pointed out to our bar server that we weren't there for the Bikinis, but for the Hockey....still had to pay the money!!!\n\nWe paid, as we wanted to carry on watching the game. \n\nFor nearly 80 minutes the Bikini contest went on, the mic feeding back so badly it started to hurt my ears. \nAn attraction like that should be kept to 60 minutes. Drunk people attention span isn't that long !!! \n\n\nI work in sound and I offered a solution to both the bartender (not interested!!) and I even grabbed the manager. He told me that he had already mentioned it to the DJ. It would have been a simple solution of reducing the mic level, or the treble. Nothing was done and it carried on squealing back continuously. \n\nSeriously, If your DJ can't deal with simple mic issues like that, he should give up and find another career. \n\nBetween the 2 of us we spent over 100$, we would have been happy to go back for the remainder of the playoffs, but will now go to Buffalo Wild Wings instead. \n\nFood was Ok, drinks kept flowing. The place was busy, but if they want to keep it that way, sort out tech issues. \n\nI'm writing this 2 hours after leaving and my ears are still hurting!!!"
1,It's so hard to find a good hair salon and hairdresser. After reading the reviews on Yelp I decided to give it a try after having a disastrous haircut somewhere else. The staff here are super friendly and their prices are very good. I also got a great haircut! Keely paid a lot of attention to my hair type (medium curls) and gave me a great cut that makes my curls look awesome. I will definitely be coming back.
1,"Hands down my favorite Froyo place. My kids love, it, my wife loves it too! It's in our neighborhood and offers quality Froyo!\n\nThe price is right for the quality. The staff is always friendly, and even after a few times remembers who you are. They recently expanded to have Gelato and some other things, in my personal opinion shouldn't have because the Froyo was awesome. \n\nThis is the best place around, wouldn't drive anywhere else!"
1,"I love this place!  I've never had beers anywhere that come close to the quality of what Arizona Wilderness is putting out time after time. Add creative and frequently rotating taps, absolutely terrific food, friendly staff, a comfortable place to hang out, and a fun vibe, and you've got the makings of a standout brewery."
0,"Went to the monroeville location using a groupon for the free tooth whitening.  The first visit, they said i had cavities that needed filled...ok...so I got them filled the same day....and they weren't filled smoothly!!  I had to come back to get the filling smoothed out because they left a ridge and it was bothering my mouth!! \n\nthey also said i needed MI paste (for $30 from them when online it's ~$15)....ok...so i got that as well not knowing it was something I could get outside of the office\n\nI had to come back in for deep cleaning.  When i got there however and went through the process, the \""deep cleaning\"" didn't seem like a deep cleaning at all.  The initial cleaning the first day seemed more thorough and hurt longer. They did all four quadrants in one session, no novicaine (which if you've had a deep cleaning before...it HURTS.....I needed the nitrous oxide the last time I had one.....and it hurt for multiple weeks after as well when I went before).  One of my friends that also has had deep cleanings also said that they're painful and hurt for days afterwards.  This one instead didn't hurt except when i was poked a few times, and i was fine to eat/etc right afterwards.\n\nWhile getting the deep cleaning the hygenist (because I never saw the dentist except for the fillings when in the past I saw them for deep cleanings as well) said that my mouth was much better and that she thought the pockets (the reason for the deep cleaning) were probably false pockets, that my mouth was much better than the previous month, that I probably didn't need the deep cleaning and that no antibiotic would be needed...maybe if I came in next time I would need them.  So I got a deep cleaning that I may not have needed, didn't feel like a deep cleaning, and set me back $900....in about an hour (they also usually take longer)\n\nPoor experiences multiple times...\n\noh--and never met Carl."
1,First this place is no longer Hair Masters its a Super Cuts. I found this place here on Yelp since my hubby works just up the street. I was in DESPERATE need of a color so I popped in ( they only take walk ins) Anyways the wait was long but they were super busy. I figured it was a good sign. I sit down tell the stylist what color I wanted and she went to work. The color came out like I wanted and much better than I thought it was going to since I bleached my hair last summer(I know what was I thinking??!) Anywho the ladies that work there are friendly and have open convos about everything...and I do mean everything so I wouldnt bring the kid like I did. Thankfully her Dad was there to take her out to lunch. The whole thing took about 2.5 hours and was only 49 bucks!! So all in all I liked it and am happy with my hair. The only negative thing I can say is the stylist put some kind of waxy based stuff in my hair and it took 3 washes to get
0,"Let's start with the Good:\n\nThe woman who served us was very friendly and attentive.\nThe couches look comfy.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nFirst off, the smell; as my companion described it, it smelled like a layer of brine overtop sewer and vinegar, none of which over powered the sickening smell of old deep fryer oil.\n\nI'd been ready to slam the menu for a lack of vegetarian options (as reported to me prior) but I think they added an eggplant sandwich. I say think because the menu was only in French (and I don't like eggplant).\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nTwo words - Turtle tank\n\n...or as my companion described it, the turtle torture tank.\n\nToo many turtles for such a small tank, electrical wires dangling in the water like some MacGuyver built death trap (I saw at least two of the poor animals get stuck and frantically thrash against these wires), and one tiny rock that wasn't big enough for more than one of them at a time. Turtles aren't fish, they need to breathe air and they need to rest - I saw several of them struggle to get adequate purchase on a tiny rock for long enough to gasp a breath.\n\nI've already reported them to to SPCA, and I plan to go back soon and check their condition."
0,"Maybe it's because I was heading to a buffet for breakfast, on a weekday, before heading in to work...but I didn't really enjoy the Carnival World Buffet.  I would say that state of mind, definitely plays a factor into your overall experience.  But for $21.99, I don't think it was worth it for breakfast.\n\nIt's much faster than the line at Starbucks or waiting to order food at the Sao Paulo Cafe, but all I ended up enjoying eating was an egg white omelet, hashbrowns and a waffle.  I also got a piece of roast beef and some fruit, but wasn't that impressed with it.\n\nThe food was decent.  They had everything that you wanted in a Vegas buffet.  But for what I ate and the price, it just didn't seem worth it."
1,"A definite hit with our party of 9. Seven hungry minor leaguers were well fed and sent back to the field happy.  We'll hit this place again next spring training.\nI looked up the other reviews first and the steaks were cooked to perfection, delivered at the same time no small feat for large groups.  Twice baked potatoes were very tasty.  The service was very attentive and helpful, even with our two Dominican players and their limited english."
1,Best taco place in the world. I often drive 30 mins out my way to eat there.
0,"J'y suis all\u00e9e avec des attentes assez basses pour le service ayant les les avis qui sont parrus avant le mien mais je m'attendais \u00e0 une bonne bouffe. Pour ce qui est de la nourriture, c'\u00e9tait excellent et je dois dire que les \u00e9toiles sont pas mal juste pour \u00e7a. C'est dispendieux mais quand le tier des services contiennent du fois gras, il faut s'en attendre. Au moins, on \u00e9pargne sur le vin parce que c'est un apportez votre vin. Toutefois, le service \u00e9tait vraiment pas \u00e0 la hauteur des plats servis. Apr\u00e8s un gros 20 minutes d'attente, il a fallu qu'on aille chercher la serveuse pour qu'elle nous donne de l'eau et un ouvre-bouteille pour les vins qu'on a emmen\u00e9. \u00c0 la fin du repas aussi, pour commander nos desserts puis pour demander la facture une fois les desserts termin\u00e9s et les assiettes ramass\u00e9es (on ne nous a pas demand\u00e9 si on voulait th\u00e9 ou caf\u00e9 non plus) il a aussi fallu que quelqu'un de notre groupe ai chercher la serveuse. Et tout \u00e7a pour notre groupe de 6 personnes qui \u00e9tait le seul dans tout le resto pour toute la soir\u00e9e! Puis, \u00e0 la sortie, j'\u00e9tais la derni\u00e8re \u00e0 payer et la serveuse m'a dit que le monsieur avant moi (un ami) n'avait pas donn\u00e9 de pourboire. Elle a ajout\u00e9e que c'\u00e9tait ill\u00e9gal de ne pas donner de pourboire car c'est son salaire et qu'on devait absolument donner un minimum de 15%. Soit elle ne connait pas le fait que le pourboire est pour un bon service ET \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du client, ou bien elle se fait avoir par son employeur....ou les deux. Dommage parce que la bouffe \u00e9tait vraiment bonne..."
1,"Pretty nice hotel, I have a particular affinity for hotels that are centrally located on the Strip. The rooms are pretty nice, and I like how their bathrooms are on the larger side, even in their regular rooms. However, I did NOT appreciate that despite the fact that I booked my room like 2 months in advance, I still ended up with some room with a handicapped bathroom. And let me tell you folks, that is the WORST. It's not a regular shower, and the curtain just blows around with the pressure of the water, basically semi-flooding the floor space. Needless to say, I was pretty ticked off so the next morning I called the front desk and switched to a regular room. I don't really get why they couldn't give me that in the first place, but whatever. \n\nTheir room service is pretty bomb, they offer a ton of different foods and it comes pretty fast. I also like how right downstairs is a big casino, shops, bars, a club (though Prive kinda sucks), and that TASTYYYYY sandwich place (check for my other review). The pool area was super crowded of course, but it wasn't too hard to find some available lounge chairs and claim a corner of the pool. I'd stay here again."
1,"Been on vacation from out of town find this place with the help of Yelp, Very happy with the service!!!"
1,Great sushi. They give you a good portion and it's always buy one get one half off.  Cant beat that!
0,"Not only was the food too greasy but they wouldn't accept our Entertainment coupon because they said it was a holiday which wasn't true. This was a Sunday, the day before Veteran's Day. I thought the point of such coupons was to build a customer base, not piss people off by making up weird rules and then quibbling about them. Never again Omelet House! Never again!"
1,Everything was delicious however their Greek lemon chicken soup was the best I've ever had. Amazing!!!
0,"Having previously reviewed a good half-dozen of Beanscene's Glasgow branches, and declared the majority of them to be utterly shit, I'm not surprised to find things to be pretty similar on the East Coast. Just poking my head in the door was enough to confirm my fears, but in the name of fairness I thought it appropriate that I at least buy a (lukewarm) bottled smoothie.\n\nChaotic, cramped, too loud, and grumpy staff who continulally champion Beanscene's charming \""drink up then fuck off\"" attitude, on a street littered with coffee shops, you don't need to stop by here."
1,"The shredded beef nachos were incredible. We ordered the fish tacos & they were way too salty. I told the waiter in a respectful way that I wouldn't recommend that dish. He saw that we didn't eat them & came back with the tacos off of our bill, no questions asked. Great service, I would come back again."
1,Great comfort/soul food spot. Food is very good and reasonably priced for what you get. Only tip I would give is to call ahead for your order.
0,"Vegas is full of similar places that serve up burgers and other American favorites for high prices. PBR Rock Bar wasn't much different, and it was our last resort after encountering long waits at better restaurants. I had the pulled pork sandwich that ended up being extremely dry, so we asked for BBQ sauce to add some moisture to the meat. The slaw was a nice touch, and I liked that it wasn't loaded with mayo. The sandwich as a whole was a good portion size, but the flavors were nothing spectacular. I'd recommend spending a little more time doing research before dining out in Vegas, otherwise you'll end up with mediocre meals like this!"
1,"If you love burgers, you'll love Bachi. Their burger patties are juicy and flavorful. Their menu gives a good variety of burger choices from the cheese burger to Vietnamese Bahn Mi burger. I also loved the Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries topped with a fried egg.  Making my mouth water just thinking about it. Mmmmmmm..."
1,"8/23/14. Yea!! We went back and they are open.. The Owner talked with us and they had an Emergency. Im glad they are still here!\nI tried the Green Chili Plate that has Pork, rice, beans and Flour tortilla. It was Delicious!! My husband had the Carne Asada Tacos and Bean and Cheese burritos. Loved it!!\nCant get enough of this place we will be back. They may be small But they know how  to Cook Mexican Food and the Customer Service is Fantastic!!"
1,"Amazing facility and friendly staff. This place is huge! Indoor track, basketball court, tennis courts, pool, racquetball... the works! Great place to take the kids too with their famous Kids World. Check it out.\n\nFollow me on twitter! www.twitter.com/edsonhong"
0,"There is nothing special about this place at all. They charge you $.75 for \""fresh jalapenos\"" . First of all they aren't fresh, they are pickled.  Second they have a condiment table where u can get your own pickled jalapenos and easily throw them on your burger just like they did. \nNow for their cheese. I will not eat a burger without cheese, but their cheese was so bad that I rather eat the burger plain. It tasted like watered down Kraft American cheese singles.\nThe lettuce in the burger was limp, had no crunch, no flavor, it was really dark. It did not look appetizing at all. \nThe meat was ok but I think it was a little over done. \nThe only good thing I have to say about this meal was the fries."
0,"The lobster bisque is amazing I do agree, however anything above and beyond the bar takes acts of congress to get right.. the server took it upon himself to assume I wanted a side portion instead of a dinner portion of a salad at dinner time (weird). It takes forever to get another beer, heaven forbid your thirsty on a bad day.... lastly by the time my husband was able to grab the attention of Said server for katsup and mustard his burger it was cold and my salad had yet to arrive.. hence the extra time to sip on my late beer waiting for dinner.. I would say there are better more collected establishments in the area... wait as I hear the second ring from the kitchen for the salad that I can see from the window but can not have... :("
1,"I have found the Garden of Eden , a place so wonderful that it inspires dreams, hopes and desires. When driving to Baker I began being fearful that once more I would be let down by a garden shop. So many times I have opened my heart to others but they have let me down. Some are out of state, some are too commercial and some really are about big business . But Baker isn't like that . From the time I pulled up I felt at home and loved.. the  old signage  giving me the vintage vibe, nice. Lots of space  and stuff to look at , a Potpourri of Pottage even. The variety of herbs and veggies alone were enough to make my heart purr. The  plants  were lined up neatly  in rows that screamed  we are cared for but not over watered and ignored.We are plants that won't get home and die from some  a mystery interloper who we brought into your garden . The grounds , employees , plants and set up all seem to express : We Too Love Gardens just Like You!\nI was so pleased to find my new partner in living green  , oh happy day ."
1,If I'm off work or in the neighborhood at St. Joe's I always try and stop by. Fast service and great sandwiches. On point though: come on off lunch hours!
0,Why does Harrahs have all their employees pushing the rewards card when you have to wait in line over an hour and get crappy service just to get one?  Another classic example of corporate incompetency.
0,"I've been all around the world eating Indian food. Especially, Dosas. Their dosas are mediocre. They're supposed to have a crunch to them. However, theirs came collapsed and slightly cold. The Malai Kofta we ordered was a touch bland. \n\nNow the tragedy...they charge $4 for a small bowel of basmati rice. I've never heard of ordering curry without a serving of rice. What a rip off. \n\nSo bottomline is that you get mediocre food for a terrible price. I would not go back."
1,"The best rotisserie chicken I've ever tasted. The best swordfish I have ever tasted. The chicken was incredibly juicy, the swordfish perfectly flakey. Get dressed up, the atmosphere is elegant with a massive patio that seamlessly melds into the dinning room. Bravo!"
1,"Finally a good frozen yogurt place in Ahwatukee! \n\nGreat flavors (love the Cake Batter), friendly employees, good topping selections (love the fresh fruit), and inexpensive.\n\nSo delicious, I will definetely be back!"
1,Great Cinnabons! The only reason I gave them a 4 star is because they have poor customer service. She never smiled at me.  Near gate A30. 8:15pm.
1,"I was, prior to visiting, a little disappointed that I never got a chance to visit D'Arcy McGee's before it was replaced by Bar Louie. After hearing from my employer and his brother-in-law that it was not such a great place, that disappointment faded.\n\nI decided to visit Bar Louie in early November while I was at Tempe Marketplace to watch a movie. I walked through the front door and was not greeted by either a hostess or any other employee. I traipsed toward the bar and was also not greeted by either of the two bartenders behind the bar. I continued forward and finally found a nice young lady whom I asked about seating. She retrieved a server and I requested to be sat on the patio. The patio was empty and I chose a corner table. My waiter informed me that he would be right back and would bring me a menu.\n\nAfter bringing a menu back, I inquired as to whether or not there were any beer specials ongoing. I was dismayed to find out that their refrigeration system was on the fritz and they only had three beers available: New Castle Brown Ale and two run-of-the-mill, piss-poor domestics. I chose the New Castle.\n\nAfter receiving my drink, I ordered from their very straightforward menu after asking the server what his personal favorite menu item was. The \""Four Tacos Plato\"" with blackened fish was selected, and off went the server.\n\nI received my food in a very timely manner and it was piping hot. Everything tasted fresh and it looked well-constructed.\n\nMy only complaint was the portion size. The tacos were listed under the \""Large Plate\"" section of the menu, but the tacos themselves were quite small. They were more reminiscent of street tacos as opposed to restaurant fare. Regardless, the service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable, the food was quite good and the atmosphere (at least from where I was sitting; on the outside looking in) seemed warm.\n\nAll-in-all, I can recommend it to others, but I can't say that it is a five-star establishment."
1,"The best food of its kind that I have experienced. I had the chicken-fried steak, which is pretty much perfect. I have no idea what could be done to improve it. My wife had the walleye sandwich. Best walleye either of us have had. Beats what I have had in the Minneapolis area, which is saying something. Cheese curds are as good or better than any I've had elsewhere.\n\nGazillion Wisconsin craft beers available, at prices that blew this Chicago resident's mind away. Three dollars and fifty cents for a Central Waters Peruvian Morning, a beer that costs at least $8 in Chicago? Yes, please, thank you.\n\nService is very friendly and informative. Yes, potentially long waits, but so it goes.\n\nOutstanding, would go all the time were I a Madison resident. If you're looking for good old-fashioned Wisconsin/upper Midwest food, this is the spot."
0,Office got cupcakes.. I got the orange cream and was soooooo disappointed!!! The cup me was so hard and dense and the frosting was HARD... it literally crumbled into a billion hard pebbles. Horrible!!
1,Lots of great teachers and a good full schedule.  Nice showers and good rates.  Wish they had a cafe but other than that highly recommend LP.
0,"I wanted to live near flamingo and strip and girlfriend wanted to save some $ so we skipped bellagio and lived in paris --- a big mistake. Totally not up to the 4 star standard. I hate the fake looking buildings. The casino lighting was bad, and the fake sky was too low that it didn't add to the look at all. Every time when I was visiting wynn or bellagio or even caesar I wanted to kick myself for booking at paris. Wifi was $15 a day at lowest rate, LOW FLOW SHOWER WATER and not hot enough. I would not book there again even for free."
0,"I'd like to really give it 2 and a half stars, but alas! yelp likes whole stars. \n\nHonestly, if you don't live in the area, I don't know if it's worth the hike up 85 (I'm in uptown). The best thing this place has going is its location. There's a beautiful corner overlooking the water and plenty of outdoor seating. However, if you sit out front, you constantly get the whiff of smoke from the smoking area being right next to the tables. \n\nAs for the food, well, I could have done just as well pulling the same items from the freezer. I had the coconut shrimp, and there were only maybe ten-twenty coconut flakes for all ten shrimp. There were other menu items that sounded good, but nothing looked over the top amazing as it came out. \n\nDrink specials, they've got those, but after that and their location, they really dropped the ball on food. If only they kicked it up, just a smidge, I feel like there's great potential."

1,"I have to say these reviews surprise me!  I've been to Living Spaces (I-10 & 67th Ave) twice now and have been thoroughly impressed with the selection, price, quality, and staff.  We've added a number of new pieces to our home and although they're still \""new\"", we're really enjoying them and love the look.  I think the price and selection, for these modern pieces is really outstanding.  Most important to me is the service and experience aspect of business and this is where I am most impressed.  In general, I find these \""big box\"" stores to lack in service, but this place is doing it right!  I've worked with four different associates and have been impressed with them all.  My last trip the staff actually pulled some strings with their manager to help me accomplish my goal (piecing together a dining room set).  The \""elements\"" section at the front of the store is great and will keep me coming back for things here or there!  I think you should check it out!"
0,"What in the hell? \nThe \""best\"" seats are actually made of cheap metal folding chairs with stained cushions?\n\nFree-flowing booze and douchebags that can't follow simple directions (HELLO!  There's no smoking in the venue, dipshits!!  Security told you 20 times!)  Getting beer spilled on me while watching the Axl Rose and Friends Show (aka Guns 'N Roses) on my man's birthday?  You're gonna get a fist in your face!\n\nWith that being said, whose idea was it to make The Joint entirely of concrete?  It just makes the acoustics very shitty and I could barely hear Axl Rose sing!\n\nI don't recall Axl sounding terrible when I saw GNR back in March at the Wiltern in LA.  Ugh, I really felt like shanking some bitches afterward...\n\nWould love to see GNR again.  Just not at \""The Joint\""."
1,"*My 200th Review*\nTarbell's, you were a dream come true!\n\nThis is what 5 stars is to me-\nThe very best service. Every staff member was professional, personable, well groomed, prompt, and smiled often!\n\nThe restaurant itself was simple and elegant. Definitely a place I would recommend for a date or special occasion or anytime you want to be fancy! \n\nThe crowd was mostly retirees, but I took that as a sign that I was in the right place.  The other diners were very dapper and able bodied and seemed to clearly enjoy the finer things in life. \n\nThe food. Mmmmmm yes!! I had the scallops, and they were the best I've ever had. It came with a potato cake and seasonal vegetables, each bite equally delicious. The salmon was also excellent and grilled to perfection. Even the grill marks were absolutely perfect, which I admire because I can not do that myself! It was accompanied by mixed greens with an amazing honey glaze dressing, and potatoes another way- similar to shoe string pik nik sticks but much fancier and salty and mouth watering. We shared the caramel cheesecake for dessert, and that was probably the low point of the meal. Kidding!! Omg, I rarely eat dessert and this was worth.every.calorie!! Perfection! Not to sweet, not too dense, not too light, so full of flavor! The caramel sauce! My, my! I really can't wait to go back. I am very curious about the spaghetti and meatballs! And the profiteroles! I want to try the whole menu, each time it changes! \nThank you Tarbell's, for making my 30th birthday dinner amazing!\n\nEdit: I received a warm phone call from Ty 2 days after dining to inquire how my experience was. I can't say that has ever happened before even at other fine establishments. Very classy. Thanks Ty!"
1,"I've been there twice and it's a good place to go on a nice date. I prefer the places that are more casual or they have their own thing going on, but I won't hold that against The Cheesecake Factory.\n\nThis place is obviously known for their cheesecake, in case you couldn't figure that out by the name of the restaurant, so I will start by talking about what they do best and move onto the meal from there. All slices of cheesecake are big and rich enough to share. These things are huge and if you're eating one by yourself then you are either a mammoth or your pig. Don't hate! Just embrace the truth! My wife and I ordered the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, which had Hulk testicle size chunks of cookie dough inside of the cheesecake. With two big squirts of whipped cream on the top and the tip of the cheesecake to complete the imagery that I'm shooting for. It was simply amazing!\n\nWhen the waitress first stopped by to ask what we would like to drink I asked for water and an Old Fashioned. To which she replied \""How hot would you like that?\"" That's when I learned that one of their burgers is called The Old Fashioned. As I write this I now realize that I should have ordered The Old Fashioned to go w/ my Old Fashioned, but let me tell you what I did get before I get too carried away. I got Renee's Special which consisted of a Turkey Sandwich, the Soup of the Day (Clam Chowder) and a House Salad. Very tasty! My only complaint on the food was that the bread, I believe it was Sour Dough was too hard. Not stale or anything, just the crust was hard as a Hulk sized... ...never mind.\n\nMy Old Fashioned was very tasty and helped me take my mind off of the man taking his three disrespectful daughters out. This good man was taking his daughters out for an early Valentine's Day dinner and all three of them were on their phone and iPads. Hopefully it doesn't take him having a heart attack from the cheesecake he ate for them to realize how disrespectful they were being.\n\nI would give 5 Strong stars but I'm going to subtract one for how close the tables were. I didn't even have to lean over to take the food from the person next to me. I wasn't trying to make friend that evening, just enjoy the company w/ my wife."
1,"Another great neighborhood place. We eat their pizzas fairly regularly for take out, which are delicious. Recently went and sat down inside. Started with splitting the Tricolore salad with the balsamic vinegar dressing, which exceeded expectations. We also got the meat lasagna and chicken parmesan, which were similar but hit the spot. Good flavors. It's a great neighborhood spot if you want a low key night with good food."
0,"This place sucks. I wasn't let in because I had a temporary drivers license that I had got 2 days ago in Texas. I also had a had copy of my Texas security license, and my old i.d card from texas. All issued by the dmv, all with the same picture and DOB. Apparently the state of Arizona doesnt accept real licenses....it wouldnt be so bad, but the \""security\"" were assholes."
0,"I can't believe I paid over $13 for two milkshakes. Why would I do that? It's not that they were bad milkshakes, they were fine, but no milkshake is that good. Not in Gilbert."
0,"When we called inquire about vegetarian options and whether or not they use lard in their tortillas and beans, the hostess was clueless about food ingredients and I was placed on hold for an inordinate amount of time. After speaking to the manager, we decided to try it out. I placed an order for a less spicy pico de gallo and when it came it burned the roof of my mouth. I asked if something less spicy could be made and was told that everything is pre-made. When the entrees came (we ordered the quinoa salad and fish tacos) I found everything so incredibly spicy that I ended up finishing my kids' quesadilla! Normally love Mexican food but am for sure going to skip this place next time."
1,"Oregano's on Camelback is one of our favorite places to go for dinner & some beers. We always take out of town guests there.\n\nThe outdoor seating in particular is one of our favorite places to hang out, eat and drink. You can enjoy your food while relaxing in an oasis-like environment outside, enjoying the breeze, the sun or a sunset. Good music is always playing (jazz and other boppy tunes) and they have heaters over the tables outside for when it gets cold at night.\n\nThey have a decent beer and wine selection, including some good ones for beer connoisseurs. Pitchers of beer pricing is reasonable.\n\nThe food is fantastic. For appetizers, we really like the Guacatoni (quesadilla served with fresh guac) and the spicy ravioli's. Pizza lovers will love their selection of pie types and calzones. There's also a good variety of pastas and salads.\n\nFor us, it doesn't get much better then Oregano's. Yes, the place is usually crowded and you'll have to wait for a table. Yes, there are birds tweeting and hopping around outside, but we love the atmosphere and the food and drinks."
1,"My husband is an avid BBQer.  We just moved to Scottsdale with our Grand Turbo cart bbq.  It was in deep need of repair and refurbishing.  The \""guru\"" replaced burners and igniters, repaired valves, and cleaned up years of use.  Now, it's like having a brand new grill.  Thank you, Guru, for your great customer service -- always timely and reliable."
0,"I've had better mexican food than this. Tried this place out today b/c my co-worker suggested it, and i was a bit disappointed. It was not busy, yet I felt rushed and confused as to why the lettuce and salsa was on the side instead of in the burrito. On top of that they charge extra for sour cream. I honestly felt the food wasn't that great at all. Chipotle taste way better. Even Roberto's is better food. This is like fake Mexican food. Maybe it was the location? but we will not be coming back to have dinner at  this place again."
1,"Tom was very helpful, crew were nice and friendly, it was a great deal! Got a $10 for $25 deal, smog done on my check list! :)"
1,"Inka Heritage did a wonderful job with my book release party. The space looked good, the food was tasty and plentiful, the staff was friendly, and the owners even cut me a deal on our agreed-upon price after their success in drinks and new potential customers. I wish Daniel, Esmeralda and their staff continued success."
0,We waited in line for 2 hours even though we had a table reserved.  Need I say more?
0,Disappointing and not very good.
1,"the wife was right...this place is quite nice. it was our first night out in vegas on a recent trip. i am not a big fan of the club music, designer jean clubs in vegas...so this place was a welcome reprieve. \n\nit is hard not to miss. beautiful chandeliers adorn every square inch of ceiling. there was an awesome band playing...straight out of the bettie page era. thus it seemed to attract a more non-douchy crowd. drinks were high as usual, but heavy on the flavor and alcohol. it's easy to find a place to sit and enjoy some music without it being too loud. very, very cool spot."
1,"Metro Pizza has turned into one of my family's favorite places to eat. We're now regulars here, thanks to the food and great service"
1,"Old town Scottsdale. Parking medium but  depends on what time you arrive.\nGood music, pretty mixed crowd with mostly cool upper class people 21-40. \n\nNice bar with good tvs with sports on. Surprising wine selection and weak beer choices. \nReally friendly bartenders and servers.\nFood selection was good and happy hour specials with drinks and gourmet bar food.\n\nDefinately good vibe and worth stopping in.\nPrices medium to mid high on normal menu.\nWill repeat."
1,"Awesome pizza, just like home, especially the Sicilian.  Lots of toppings, and the dough was a good 2 inches thick. Well worth the wait."
1,"This place is awesome!! We order probably weekly from them because it's so yummy and convient. They deliver for free, the food is always hot, fast, and super good! All the employees are also very nice. We love it and if you like chinese food you will too!!"
0,"NIce ambience and great service.\n\nThe waiter recommended an off-the-menu catch of the day, which was grouper. It came with potatoes and steamed vegetables. The food came out in a pot looking plate. I expected the grouper (by the waiters description) to be very well seasoned. Instead it looked seasoned but I could not get any taste out of it. The same applied with the potatoes, no taste either :(\n\nDon't understand why the waiter called this his favorite dish.\n\nMy friend was explaining to me that this was one of the best cuisines in town and it is volunteer ran. All the profits are donated to charity. Which makes it hard for me to give this place a bad review.\n\nThe wine and beer selection was decent.\n\nI'd recommend trying the flank steak, that didn't look too bad but be wary you might need to bring your own spices and seasoning!"
1,Sat down for a very nice meal here. Large portions accompany a large check. \n\nThe Mac and cheese (with truffles) is to die for - and at $6/9 it doesn't get much better!\n\nThe wait staff was very friendly.
1,"Ok, real talk time. This is a sports bar, and they also run OTB (off-trck-betting). That's a thing, and that means there are some folks in there just to watch the races and bet, maybe grab a beer and that's all. Does that bug me? Not one bit. \n\nAs far as the bar and restaurant portion is concerned, this place is everything I like. The bartenders and servers remember my name, what I drink, always smile when I come in, and have a blast doing what they do. They play all my games (NFL, MLB, NHL and even EUFA Champion's League and MLS). If I want to watch something near where I'm seated, they always do their best to accommodate. Couple that with cheap, cold beers, strong pours, and really decent bar food, and you have a winner. \n\nAnd let's talk food. I'm a vegan, and it kills me to sit near the kitchen. The wings smell amazing, the sandwiches and burgers are piled high, the fries are hand-cut and awesome, and the things I do eat - the fried zucchini, chips and salsa, etc. - have been great. Mikey, one of the cooks, pulls double duty as a great cook and storyteller. He's one of the things that makes the place fun to spend time at. \n\nI've read some of the other reviews about bad service - I've seriously never had any here, and I have a hunch half of them aren't legit. I've come here when Charity, Amanda, Destiny, Boston, Nick and a few others were serving, and honestly I've never waited more than 2 minutes for a drink - and that was when they were slammed. Food has always been good, and fast, and filling. Charity is freaking awesome, and Boston knows every game's outcome before it happens. He's like Rain Man or something, an absolute riot. \n\nBottom line: If you're looking for a white-glove one-on-one service experience, go to one of the foofy places nearby. Want an awesome sports bar with good food, drinks, people, music and a fun atmosphere? Get here, and I'll buy your first pint."
1,"This place is great. I had friends tell me about it and no one could quite describe to me what the food was like, now having been there I understand why. It is excellent and undescribeable. Its like the most magnificent hot pocket you could ever imagine stuffed with a variety of different delicious combinations"
1,"Coming here is so fun I mean how could it not be, it the drive in movies you always have the perfect seat, you can eat whatever you want, and it's okay to talk. Its like a cross between a movie theater and your living room. It can be romantic  date or a fun family outing where no one gets upset if the kids have input on the movie. The movie seats recline and there is never anyone in front of you to keep you from putting your feet up that what dashboards are for. Gotta love it the movies with privacy."
0,"OK, my first one star review.  Not that I have never been anyplace worthy of the single star but I usually figure those places have enough problems without my one star review.\n\nI have stopped here to grab a quick sandwich coming or going to Nevada several times.  I recognized the woman at the counter  as having waited on me before.  I was about 3 people back in line when I heard a gentleman ask her if the food item she was giving him was the same one just returned by another customer.  She acknowledged it was and he asked for a fresh one, which she promptly gave him.  I don't know the whole story, how long it was away from the counter if at all.  Heck for all I know it was a drive through customer that didn't have enough funds when they got to the window and they unbagged some or all of an order.  The exchange that I heard made me uncomfortable and I got out of line and got a bag of Cheetos in the store to munch on."
1,"The noodles are delicious and this is an excellent place for kids. I loved that the kids were able to watch the noodles being made and watched them come right out to the table. It makes their food experience more interesting and made for great table conversation.\n\nThe noodles are hand pulled so don't expect what you would get out of a package. There are inconsistencies in the noodles sizes and separation and that's what makes this place so awesome! it's amazing to watch the process and unique in our cookie cutter machine operated day and age. I felt like I was watching, wait for it...MAGIC! If you don't like thick noodles then be sure to order the thinnest option on the menu. \n\nMy opinion, yummy and worth taking the family!"
1,Great spot.  Friendly staff.  Awesome happy hour.  Live music is usually pretty good as well.  Bathrooms are too small but it's usually not an issue.
1,"I happened to walk by this cute little shop while browsing the shops over in Happy Valley and it immediately caught my attention. I mean for one it had free samples of bread and olive oil waiting for you to try. Sweet lord!!! I was in olive oil and balsamic vinegar heaven. Dawn was so very friendly and she explained to me that they opened about 6 weeks ago and how the process of their shop worked. They get their olive oils and vinegars from all over the worlds and the olive oils are rotated out often. The oils also range from very mild to very robust in flavor. Their were olive oils infused with wild mushroom, basil , chipotle, and garlic just to name a few. They also have these wonderfully 18 year aged balsamic vinegars that were out of this world. The fig and the black cherry were pretty good but my absolute favorite was the lavender balsamic vinegar. Dawn had me try it with a little bit of the basil extra virgin olive oil and it was so good, I ended up buying a bottle of both. They were so not on my grocery list but they were really that good. Plus those of you who know I like to cook know I will definitely be experimenting with these. \n\nIf you happen to be in the Happy Valley area, and are exploring the shops over at Norterra, stop by Olive Creations. They also have different mustard's, olives, and jellies that you can also sample while you are there. Oh I forgot to mention, you can sample every single olive oil and every single balsamic vinegar so you know exactly what they taste like before you buy it and the prices are very, very reasonable. So all my chefs in the AZ area, go check this place out,, purchase a few things, and then call me so that I can come over for dinner!!"
0,"Meh. I went here for an appointment with Anastasia for gel and glitter. I waited patiently and ended up with an appointment with a completely different person than what I was told I was going to see.\n\n I asked her I wanted gel with glitter and she had no idea what I was talking about. She said she can do gel polish with glitter in it but not any type of loose glitter with gel. The lady they gave me only does regular acrylic nails and was even too afraid to do the glitter as she didn't know what she was doing. Finally another lady said that she can do it but that i would need to wait a moment until she's finished with the appointment.\n\n I waited a half an hour and finally saw the lady. I did not realize that she was pushing me in between her appointment and she did it very quickly, maybe lasted about 20 minutes. I have never had my nails done that only takes 20 minutes. She ended up using a shellac gel instead of an actual gel builder. And it was very clumpy and uneven, to were you could see a dip in the middle of each of my nails.\n\n The only reason I'm giving it any stars is that the owner was very apologetic and tried to accommodate the situation, but I was disappointed.\n\n Also, I had went there with a spa finder gift card. I had $10 left. instead of just taking the money off of that card and giving me the card to go somewhere else, the receptionist traded it for a total bliss card. This now, forces me to have to go back to them just use the rest of the card."
1,"Nice clean store, friendly people.  The great thing is it doesn't get crowded like Fry's.  I am disappointed they have a wells fargo inside, as I think wells fargo is a garbage bank."
0,"I made a stop at the pool store in the same complex and when I saw a vape shop I decided to check it out.  I needed some new heads for my Protank 3, so I grabbed a box.  I realize I'm not going to get the same prices as I would online but I paid $5 per head where I can order ANYWHERE online for around $2 per head.\n\nThe guy working the counter did seem knowledgable but he actually told me I could get the MVP 2 for much cheaper online, which I already knew but I thought it was pretty hilarious he suggested I order online instead of buying from them."
1,"Oh Vintage 95, I am in love with you! \n\nThis place is fantastic.  From the modern decor to the eclectic menu options.  I can't say enough about this place.  Did I mention that I like this place?  I went here for a lunch while visiting downtown Chandler.  I have had V95 on my Bookmark for a while.  \n\nFirst, you walk into this establishment and it is a posh modern place of beauty.  This time (Early spring/Late winter) of the year is perfect for going to a place like V95 because they can open all the doors and extend the inside outward.  \n\nI enjoyed my bruschetta board very much.  My friend and I both had wonderful glasses of wine."
0,"First, I'll talk about the Pros.  The Pros are the boarders.  Nicest people you'll ever meet.  Plus, you have miles of open trail riding.  However, speaking for myself the Cons out weighed the Pros.  The Cons are the following:  inconsistency in feeding times (especially on the weekends), stalls cleaned every third day, once a month manure is spread within horse's stall, water buckets are changed once a week on Friday (unless a Holiday falls on it then it's the following week), horses are fed alfalfa cubes twice a day unless specified (leaving a lot of unsatisfied horses losing weight or over licking salt blocks), manure is dumped in riding arena, most of the staff including the special needs individuals lack insight on equine health issues, horses are moved from stall to stall without talking to horse's owner first, the Ranch Owner never walks the boarding area to address boarder's concerns or look at the boarder's horses (personally, I saw her twice in two months and I try to be there at least five days a week) and finally the Ranch Owner's behavior was unprofessional by yelling at me in front of other boarders  She should have pulled the me off to the side and spoken to me privately.  I wouldn't recommend Rocking H to horse owners who are proactive advocates in their horse's well being and overall care because it wouldn't be appreciated at this facility.  These facts are what I observed and experienced first hand.  The Owner will tell you I'm disgruntled and inexperienced.  I'm the first to admit, you can never learn enough when you own a horse.  Information changes day by day and it's important to have an open mind to new ideas."
1,This is by far the best Greek I've had. Our family visits here often. My wife is vegetarian and loves the spanakopita. It is really big and she loves it! I get the gyro with fries. Both are so flavorful. The fries have homemade spices on top. This appears to be own by a family. The mom is always in the kitchen cooking and the children help with seating and orders. We've done sit down and take out. Both are great!
0,Horrible horrible horrible horrible I want my money back Rebeca destroyed my hair I look horrible I paid to get my hair styled she couldn't even do that. My advice don't go here they will destroy your hair.
0,"So, this review is for the horrible service I received trying to dispute a $420 overcharge today, and their technical problems that they should fix with all the money they make. Booked hotel online on cyber Monday, but their site was having a glitch, so I had to waste time to call the hotel, be on hold, let them find the problem, and confirm my reservations. Ok, fine, problem solved even though the lady said they charged me twice, but that she will fix it so that I will be charged only once.\n\nFast forward, went to COSMO, room was ok although for that price, the shower shouldn't have nasty water and scum stains...had fun,but just checked my cc, and they charged me again for the same charge on my checkout date. Wtf?!! So, somehow I'm assuming my payment didn't show up prepaid?! Fine! So, to fix THEIR MISTAKE, I waste MY time calling them to get my money back, and get transferred twice, talked to lady about overcharge, then she said she'll look up my account, put me on hold while they look it up. As I'm on hold, I hear the music.. music.. then clicks like someone picked up (no music), then music, then click, then ringing, then all of a sudden, \""you have reached the accounting department, and blah blah blah, CLOSE! Please leave a message.. Blah blah blah...' \n\nOk... Thought they may have pressed the wrong button, so hung up and called them again, and got this RUDE A$$ LADY WITH MUCHO ATTITUDE. I'm trying to explain that there was a lady helping me and put me on hold, so please transfer me back. She starts going off telling me that it's an accounting problem, they're closed, nothing they can do, probably why the girl forwarded my call to voicemail, yadda yadda yadda. IF YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR JOB, THEN DON'T WORK THERE SINCE IT SHOWS IN YOUR VOICE! \n\n3.5 stars\n-1 SCUM & WATER STAINS IN SHOWER\n-1 RUDE LADY ON PHONE, NO HELP\n-1 OVERCHARGING ME"
1,"i'm telling you. restaurants in hotel lobbies are totally underrated. don't believe me? read this: http://www.yelp.com/biz/lafittes-phoenix\n\nthis is the third restaurant in the tandoori times family. i haven't been to the other locations, but based on the reviews for those establishments, tandoori times 3 ranks right up there.\n\nadmittedly, the place was deserted last night, but i'm told it's hopping on fridays and saturdays when they bring in belly dancing and hookah.\n\nthe decor is completely new (the holiday inn has also been recently renovated). it's comfortable, spacious and has a modern feel.\n\nthe manager -- whose name escapes me at the moment -- was also our server. she is pleasant, funny and her presence alone will guarantee my return. any server that is willing to engage in friendly banter is okay in my book.\n\nlastly, the food was excellent. (should i have said that first? ha.) i can't speak intelligently on indian cuisine. but suffice it to say that i enjoyed it very much. and fried cottage cheese is now one of my major food groups. check it out."

1,Food is very authentic & delicious but seating is very limited.  Reservations need to be made at least 2 hours in advance.
0,"I'm torn between one and two stars here so will give them the benefit of the doubt. The atmosphere is cute, as everyone has said and my server was friendly and efficient. Those were the only good things about the experience though. I ordered a patron margarita and when the waiter brought it it looked like a glass of water. Unfortunately, it tasted like one too. I don't like to send things back, but this was the worst margarita I have ever had and for $14+ I had to send it back. Then came my salad. It was some kind of a chinese chicken salad. The flavor would've been pretty good if they hadn't put so many crunchy noodles in it. Those were the only thing that I could taste. This isn't a restaurant that I will be returning to."
1,"Wifey and I travel allot, we always search out unique places for the experience and quality food. Michaels is the best at everything they do. First and foremost, it is not \""trendy\"". There are no fries covered with toppings, there is no Pork Belly glazed with Maple or God knows what. \nThere is however some of the freshest fish, best beef and salads anywhere along with outstanding service. \nIt is very old school and the Waiters are the best we have seen. \nDinner here starts with a wonderful Garnish tray that among other things include Quail Eggs, Olives, Pickles, Cucumbers and Beats. They also give you toasted Dark Bread with Parmesan cheese, and crackers, etc.\nOn this particular visit, I ordered the Live Maine Lobster. This thing was a Monster, huge. Cooked to perfection, I selected broiled. They dress the Lobster table side. \nI also had the French Onion soup, the best I've ever had. \nThe sides were Cream Corn and a Baked Potato. \nI could go on and on, but one must try this place, you will love it. \nOne last thing, dress nice, there is a dress code and bring your money. On this visit, there were 5 of us, $1500.00. And I can't wait to go back."
0,I dislike this place but it's close to my house. The service is poor. It will be at least 5-8 mins before anyone comes to your table. Food is ok. Don't ask for extra ranch because you won't get it.
0,"A large selection to be sure, but this is not a good place to buy a build your own six pack: there is no discount for buying 6 at a time and the singles range from $3.50-$11.  A build your own six pack should cost between $10-$15 unless you're buying it from a bar, not $18+ for average beers.  Granted they have lots of premium singles that are reasonably priced in the $4-$8 range.  Maybe I'm just used to lower prices in Massachusetts, but $24 for a six pack of domestic craft beers seems ridiculous.  Come here for a regular six, a magnum, or a couple of premium singles, but don't get hosed on their build your own six packs.  If you're after a build your own, go to Giant Eagle Market District in Shady Side (good selection, $12.99 for a build your own) or the other Itz Doggin It in Squirrel Hill on Murray ave - they're still on the higher end at $14.99, but at least it caps out there."
0,"Like everyone else, this place is a joke. They make you pay for liability insurance, and mind you I rent cars all the time. Nobody else makes you pay for that sh*t. And to be honesty all the people who work there are PAYLESS and I'm sure they get PAID just as LESS. There is no quality in cars, people, customer service and their prices are far from PAYLESS...I tried calling customer service b/c we will going to be late returning our rental and of course, nobody answers the phone for an hour and I even left a courtesy message to these A**holes to call me back and guess what, no return call. I guess I did PAYLESS for customer service. \n\nSo people pleeeese, if you are going to rent a car pleeeeese DO NOT use PAYLESS because you get what you PAY for. CRAP!!!!\nBelieve me the corporate office will be hearing from me and they just might get a nice call to the BBB!!! Merry Xmas!!!"
1,The infused whiskey is my favorite beverage at this restaurant! Looking forward to more choices of this style!! The food is bar food with some twists however the exemplary service is what makes this spot stand out! Look out Lodge there's a new place to choose.
1,"Stopped in for some coffee last week and have been every weekday since. Everything I've had here is good. Would pick this place over Starbucks any day of the week.\n\nSo far I've tried the Raspberry Mocha and peanut butter Mocha, both awesome!"
1,My girls and I had a lot of fun at Tryst.  Really like the outdoor/indoor set up.  Waterfall is nice.  Great music. Helps when you don't have to pay for any of your drinks:-)  I would go back next time I'm in Vegas.
1,"Awesome night club. DJ Eric Prydz was in the house last week and he rocked the place! Dance floor was more crowded than usual, but that was to be expected. The club has a really nice layout, and I love how it opens up to the outside pool area. Drinks are pretty pricey though. A long island will run you $17. Other mixed drinks around $15. I'm glad they didn't close off the outside like some other clubs just because it's November. The weather is fine and it's nice to get some cool air. I just hope they choose to ban smoking some day. That's always the worst part about any club. But I've always had great experiences here, so I highly recommend it if you're in Vegas."
0,Do not mimic someone if they can hear you on the speaker.  Other then that chips are stale but tacos good.
1,"Super cool little urban lunch spot, outdoor patio seating is ideal for AZ spring time.  one little word of caution... at the north entrance obey the watch your step sign... I didn't and I ate it big time, that being said, the food was so good it made me forget all about my fall.  I recommend the route 66 wrap (amazing)."
1,Had a wonderful bottle of wine and delicious apps on the outside patio on Friday evening.  The service was great and friendly.  Was fun to sit with my friends and get to know other patrons who were sitting in the outdoor 'living room' space
0,"We went to the Red Lobster at Carolina Place this past weekend. The quantity of the food was great; quality was adequate. Service was abysmal. Just as an example, our server brought our ticket to the table. 15 minutes later, she ambled by to pick up the ticket with our credit card. 10 minutes later, she finally brought it back for me to sign. This was after an hour-and-a-half dining experience which should have taken half the time but due to our waitress' slowness and lack of attention, was stretched into painful wait times. Never received a refill on my soda. This was not during prime time, either - we arrived around 4:30PM on Saturday.\n\nAs far as the food went, it was good - I had the Admiral's Feast, which I took half of home because it was so much. My wife had the Crab Feast, which she did enjoy. The Cheddar Bay biscuits made up for much, but if I get in the mood for those again, I may just phone in an order and pick it up.\n\nI just hope our server never goes to a zoo; I would hate for her to get dizzy watching the speed of the tortoises there.\n\nAs far me, I'm going to give this location a miss moving forward."
1,"DELICIOUS!!! We waited about 40 minutes for table of 3, but no big deal as you can have a beer, or two, and the people watching is great!  We ordered the cornbread as an appetizer.  Pure heaven.  Buttery, sweet, smoky.  The brisket is so good, very tender and a great smoky taste.  The sauce is very flavorful, made me sweat!  If you like a sauce that is thick and sweet (like a sweet baby ray's, for example), this is not it.  Black Dog's is much better!  The sweet potato fries are nice and crispy, sweet/salty, and you get a nice portion of them.  The slaw is a vinegar slaw, not a creamy mayo slaw, so keep that in mind.  We got there around 6:00 pm and they were already out of the burnt ends, so not sure how early you have to get there to order them.  I'm not sure why some on here seem to be uptight about the service.  These people ARE WORKING THEIR BUTTS OFF!!  Have you seen how crazy busy they are?   Plain and simple, GO HERE.  EAT.  DRINK.  YOU WILL BE HAPPY."
0,"The first time we went, the salmon and prime rib were delicious. We really enjoy the ambiance and the live music. The service was slow and we were thirsty, but we decided to give it a second chance.\n\nThis time we took friends. I have to say that the blackberry margarita is superb, but our service was terrible. The server's family was at a table beside us and the husband was reminding the server to check on us!\n\nThe food had obviously been sitting under a warmer for some time because my mashed potatoes were baked and crusty. The bread/roll was cold. No butter. My husbands NY strip was 60% fat and inedible. The beers were slow coming from the bar and we never got the water we asked for...twice. Our appetizer showed up via food runner as we were all finishing our meal! \n\nThen...the \""Assistant General Manager\"" showed up at our table with the server in tow. He asked us how our service was and why we didn't want the appetizer. IN FRONT OF THE SERVER! Then he proceeded to slur, repeat himself, explain that last week he was a cook and since he got this promotion he's fired 105 people for 20 MINUTES! The whole time he wished us Happy St. Patrick's Day about 15 times.\n\nI seriously thought he would never go away. I could not make this up. What a surreal evening. If it weren't for the awesome company and delicious margarita, we would've been really angry. In the end, we just laughed at the guy and decided that this restaurant wasn't worth the $110 we had just spent there!\n\nWe will never, never, ever go back. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone that I like."
1,"If you want to talk to your friends - you might want to go somewhere else.  If you're looking to pick up some honeys, ditto.  If you're looking to hang w/ your friends or \""special someone\"" to listen to great music - this is one of the most under-looked spots in Phoenix to see local blues music.  \n\nUnless you go into the other room to play pool, there are no bad seats as seating goes out all around the small stage, with a nice sized open center for dancing.  The bar is large, and the service has always been pretty attentive.  Also - I never have problems finding a place to put my drink.  That is SO important to me in a club w/ music where you might be nursing one a bit longer than at a typical bar.  \n\nBig Pete Pearson has been really awesome there.  Our guest was actually pulled into some audience participation with him and got to strum his guitar.  How cool is that??  The location is also great - but can be so easy to pass.  It's a small building that used to be a house with sign out front, but it's blocked a bit by another building in one direction - so be sure to look out for it next time you're in the area."
0,"Beautiful place but terrible service. Terrible food!!!! Atmosphere was middle age white couples. We were a group of people from different ethnicities and were pretty much out of place. Not good for big groups. They are not accommodating at all! For such a pricey place you would think the food would be good. It was so bad and does not even taste fresh! \n\nVery disappointed, would not come back!"
1,"What more can be rewarding after a 5 hour hike at Red Rock, I'll tell you what....a good ass breakfast!  My first time here and by the looks of the food on the table and how crowded it was being a wednesday afternoon, I knew it was gonna be good.\n\nMy friend was on her whack diet (she ain't even fat), so she just ordered tuna salad and biscuit with gravy.  I ordered the mexican omelette and red velvet pancakes, which I never there was such a thing.  The mexican omelette had marinated carnitas, sliced jalapenos, pico gallo, pepper jack cheese and topped off with sour cream.  It was pretty good but the red velvet pancake was the main dish I enjoyed the most.  I have never been a big fan of anything red velvet and this is the first.  She gave me a bite of her biscuit and gravy but I thought she was done with it and I killed it.  Haha she was like really, I look down for one second and you eat it all without sharing, ooops.\n\nVery affordable too with friendly servers who attend to you right away and checks up occasionally, despite the place being busy.  I will definitely be coming here for breakfast again. My ex and her tuna salad, what a waste of visit to baby cakes for her."
0,Not a big fan of haze its costs way to much for what it is.
0,"FYI: Will not accept restaraunt.com coupons.  Printed off the coupon and headed out for the 30 min drive to check this place out  and there was a big sign on the door that said we do not accept restarunt.com coupons., then why are you offering a coupon on there?   We all kinda had a bad taste for this place after we saw the sign and went to switch instead."
0,"I don't know what it is but when it comes to Vegas, I become a lot more critical on the service and appearance of things. Maybe it's because the way the city is so centered on delivering the best and the inflation of costs to cover that. So when it came to Caesar's, I needed to know what it was all about. \n\nWhenever I come to Vegas, I usually stay at the newer, more modern hotels but this trip, I wanted to see why Caesar's remain to be one of the oldest casino's but yet can afford to expand every year and also hold one of the best shopping and eating areas in Vegas. \n\nWhen I checked in on Saturday, I had a the Forum Tower Deluxe room booked. But as I was checking in, the front desk asked if I wanted to upgrade my room to a Palace Petite Suite for just 60$. He explained that it double the size of the Deluxe room + more modern. I immediately took the deal and made my way to my room and man o man, was I disappointed. The rooms are in SERIOUS need of a renovation. Based on other yelpers, apparently only some of the towers are renovated to have the modern feel but my room was clearly not one of them. The walls had the old wallpapers from I don't know, the 90's? And also, the TV was really old and small (I mean TV's being so affordable these days, they can't upgrade that?). Anyways, I overlooked the aesthetic flaws of the room and went to go take a shower. WTF? The shower doesn't have hot water. Like really? NO HOT WATER IN VEGAS?! So I called the front desk and complain about the issue of the hot water on top of that, I wanted to actually downgrade my room back to a Forum Deluxe. They tell me that all the rooms have been booked and that I can't change my room unless it was upgraded to a more expensive suite and that they would send over a technician to check out the problem. At this point, I was already disgruntled by the service here and waited impatiently for the technician. Fortunately, he came immediately and tells me that this issue is an actual issue that requires them to open up the shower and change the hot water cartridge. I call back the front desk and the supervisor advises me that I would need to go back down to the front desk and speak personally with the supervisor about this issue. \n\nAt this point, I was already furious and marched my way down to the front desk and I tell them my issue (I was rude and I had a reason to). They gave me a $50 food and beverage credit for this mistake and they move me to a similar room one floor above (I thought they had no more rooms left?). \n\nHonestly, Caesar's Palace might not have resort fees but they also don't have a refrigerators in their room (yeah, if you want one, you need to rent one for $$$) and their rooms are OLD. I realize that this hotel is one of the oldest ones but honestly, it's just a tourist trap. If it wasn't for their somewhat good service and providing compensation for their faulty rooms, they would've received a 1 star. \n\nI rather pay less and get a better room at the Cosmo and a lot better service."
1,"Went for brunch and would definitely recommend it.  My boyfriend and i tried the masa boat surprise, smoked pork pozole, and 2 mexican coffees.  The mexican coffee was delicious, like a spiced coffee with nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove.  My boyfriend said it had a little too much spice for him, but it reminded me of a spiced latte.  \n\nThe masa boat surprise was tasty, although I recommend getting a little bit of everything in each bite.  Eating just the egg and chorizo can be a little bland, but eating it with the veggies, cheese, salsa, black beans and some of the corn \""boat\"" is sooo good.  \n\nThe smoked pork pozole was really good, although it could have been a dinner item if not for the poached eggs.  It was kind of like a mexican stew with a couple poached eggs, and some beer bread.  The beer bread was very tasty.  \n\nWe'll definitely be going back and try some other things.  Radio Maria's has a pretty extensive breakfast and lunch menu."
1,We (spouse and kids) love it there. And they totally welcome kids - LOVE that they have organic milk to give the kiddos. My toddler loves the beans and nachos. The chiliquiles and enchiladas are good.
0,Slowest service ever! And I don't have high expectations for mcdonalds but geez when there's a line with 15+ people you would expect they would put two people on register. They're so understaffed too! The cashier took an order and then went to prepare the food. AGH.\n\nTLDR; The people here like to work in slow motion.
1,"Small, laid back, delicious hole in the wall-esque place on State Street. Nepalese has a lot of the flavors I love about Indian, but isn't as heavy so I will always be up for it. \n\nThey have an extensive vegetarian menu which I'm frequently too stuck in my carnivorous ways to delve into, unfortunately.\n\nSome great options:\n1) Get the momochas to share as an appetizer. They're tasty, light dumplings in a tasty tomato sauce. I haven't actually tried the meat-itarian momos just yet.\n2) For entree...well, they're all quite tasty, but I'm partial to the beef buff.\n3) If the dish doesn't come with roti (flat bread), make sure to order some."
0,"30 seconds in this posh place, and I was already excited. They had a coffee bar, the most awesome assortment of bottled beverages I've seen in ANY hookah bar, and the atmosphere--oh my, is it lavish.\n\nIt was a trap!\n\n $15 for a one hose hookah ties the priciest I've ever paid. Wait, what's that? It's $20 just because it's a Saturday night? Now you're pushing it. Well, at least I can split the cost with my friends. Four people to a hookah will be alright, I suppose. A cover charge, you say? Five dollars for each of my friends who didn't order a hookah? Alright, now we're up to $35 for four of us to share a one hose.\n\nBut the nickel-and-diming doesn't end there. You'll also be required to purchase a drink. No hard feelings about the drink itself--the introduction to sparkling Voss ($4) was welcome. But to pay for that after the cover...isn't that a little extreme for a hookah bar?\n\nAfter shelling out what felt like a ripoff, I was still ready to have my mind blown by this place. Too bad I didn't even get to sit on the second floor! I asked, and received no reason why it couldn't be done when my party was the only one in the building. If you ever have the misfortune of coming here, you'll see why that's a big deal--the second floor is the coolest little balcony you'll ever see at at a hookah bar.\n\nSo I finally get the hookah. It looked like an expensive piece, but I was displeased to see instant light coals (low quality) sitting on top. I huffed and I puffed, but could barely muster one iota of smoke. After sucking ash, I complained to the waitress, who was almost clueless about what to do.\n\n15 minutes later, I got my hookah back. It smoked alright...too bad they used the cheapest shisha. Why charge so much when you use such a low quality product? \n\nI can barely even call Harem a hookah bar. I think that's just a front. It's a place to sip coffee and Voss in style, that just happens to serve subpar hookahs on the side. It's the most expensive place of its kind, yet has the worst quality I have ever encountered. One star is too much, and I may never go again...unless they let me smoke on the second floor."
1,"My Husband and I planned a night at IPIC and we decided to begin our night at Salt, and I am glad we did. It is a nice little lounge with some very tasty salt rimed cocktails. The bartender was very nice and helpful within the first five minutes not only did he take our drink orders but he also gave us a nice glass of water with cucumber and basil, that was a nice touch. The seared tuna appetizer was delicious, the lighting was perfect for romance and the music was fun. I must admit it was a little expensive hence the 4 star rating but, I cannot deny that drinks at Salt helped make our night as fun and memorable as it was."
0,"The server, who looked Spanish, was horrible. So horrible, I realize I don't even know his name. He ignored me when I called to him and only raised his hand to acknowledge my call the second time around, without turning his head. When we were paying, he left the credit card machine with us, so we had to tear our own receipt, while he chatted with a larger group.There was not one smile. No introduction. No request for drinks. The food  left us desiring as well. Monotone tub of gnocchi. Pasta with meat sauce, fries and the calamari were good. Bruschetta was freshly made but just didn't have anything to it. Bread was cold but we were so hungry, bread dipped in evoo and pesto was good. The server experience really ruined our first night in montreal for that trip. I have been here many years ago and was hoping for the same fun night out but I guess things change."
0,"I was really looking forward to this due to all the great reviews and also because, after days of paying for $25 dollar entrees, my wallet needed a break big time.  \n\nMaybe they were having a bad day (I notice another 1 star reviewer went the same day I did).  Quite simply, the food was inedible.  First off, this is a place that LOVES their organ meats.  No fish or chicken tacos here so keep in mind that choices are very limited if you don't like tripe, brain, tongue or head tacos.  That's ok, we went for the carne asada fries, Abodabo and spicy pork tacos.  Fries looked awesome.  First bite....my mouth filled with fat/gristle/tendon.  Ick.  I'm a good sport, tried another bite.  Huge piece of fat.  One more bite.  Same thing.  Moved on to the abodabo taco.  First bite.   Fat.  I wasn't dumb enough to try another bite.  Spicy pork taco next.  No fat but no flavor either.  \n\nSo yeah it was only $20 for me and my husband to \""eat\"" but neither one of us actually got to swallow any of it.  Have not had this horrible of a restaurant experience in years.  I'm left wondering, did I truly go on an off day or do regular folk just love fat filled tacos?  I'm certainly not putting out another $20 to get an answer to that one."
1,"The waitress staff has changed around a bit and it shows, however the knowledge of the staff selling cigars is amazing. I had a Arturo Fuente anjeo which was the perfect recommendation for me. Make sure to ask for the home made chips there delicious"
0,"went to Harbor Palace for dim sum,most was cold and the same carts came around 4 or 5 times with the same cold dishes on carts.Used to be a lot better but seems like things have changed for the worse.will not be going back anytime soon."
0,Super greasy. Super fattening. Had to eat with fork and knife. When the food left the wax paper an orange puddle remained. The chili is fine ground grease paste. I am pretty sure I got my entire life serving of trans fat.
1,"Frank and Fina's has been one of my go to favorites for years!  I always suggest it for girly lunches with loads of chatty women and friends or casual dinners.  \n\nIt has a very neighborhood feel.  It is very affordable and delicious.  \n\nMargaritas are $5  - try to find that elsewhere.  Sangria is $10 but is served in a little carafe that holds 2 glasses.  \n\nI just dined the other day and everything was tasty and friendly as usual.  The chicken or steak and avocado salad is always a winner.  Lots of steak, sliced red onions, cucmbers, and big slices of fresh avocado all drizzled with house vinaigrette make it a mexican style salad you can sink your teeth into but not feel guilty about.\n\nTheir soups are excellent.  I am a big fan of the albondigas (meatball).  It tastes just like a sweet little grandma made it.  Hearty chunks of carrot, chayote, potato, and big flavorful meatballs all on a hot hot slurpable broth.  I usually do a bowl of that and 2 a la carte tacos for a perfect lunch!\n\nThey have other winners that I reccomend trying like the sweet potato enchiladas (yup!) and the chuletas - yummy pork chops tossed with copious amounts of blackend onions, served with tortillas and all the goods.\n\nIt isn't THE best Mexican you have ever had in your life....but it is very good, very affordable, and a nice place to sit and dine."
0,"They basically STOLE my ticket back from me! My husband and I were flying my folks out to Phoenix to babysit our kids for a few days. We bought them each a round trip ticket from LA to Phoenix. A day later we realized we needed them here a day earlier than planned, and of course understood there'd be a $150 change fee per ticket. So, I kept the ticket as it was and purchased a new, additional one-way ticket for just my mom so she could get here early and then my stepdad would fly out a day later on the original ticket. All was good until it was time to check them in for their return flight back to LA. My mom's original return flight wasn't coming up on the computer. I called US Airways and they said since she didn't travel on her original flight out, that she unknowingly forfeited her return flight as well. After utter shock and anger, they made me buy another last minute, full-priced ticket to get her home today. So to sum it up they received twice the money from us, and then received money from another passenger for using my mom's original seat. Does this sound unreasonable to anyone else? There's no reason they couldn't have just put her on that plane this morning without charging us yet again. I'm disgusted with this airline and will avoid them as well as American, for any future flights."
1,"The food and the service were both exceptional. The lamb Marsala was wonderful so was the vindaloo but get ready to sweat as with any good authentic Indian dish (:  we eat at the sister restaurant. \""Blue Taj\""  quiet often and love the ambiance there , we like the private feel there. Little more but still a great restaurant for Authentic Indian fo"
0,"This used to be our go-to delivery place, but they must have changed owners or management or something. Regardless, the pizza comes cold, the cheese is partially melted, it tastes frozen, and tonight they took 2 hours before I called the manager and refused delivery. Late, cold, crappy pizza? No thanks, I'll spend my cash elsewhere."
0,The young lady with all the attitude who works mornings during the week at this location has tried to ruin our day for the last time.  There's never justification for rudeness and becoming mouthy with paying customers. We've taken our business to another location in the area and it is so much better.
0,"I've been a customer here for a number of years.  Always had good service until recently.  I went into the store to have batteries and service done on five watches.  While I was there I noticed they started carrying Glycine watches which I've had my eye on for a while.\n\nA young salesperson quoted me a price of $2,900.00 for one of the Airmen Multi-Time Zone watches that they were selling on consignment.   I knew it was a good price but needed to think on it.  When I got home my wife said she would buy it for me for Father's day so I turned right around the same afternoon (less than 30 minutes later) and when back to the store.\n\nWhen I returned, I was told by the salesperson that he misquoted the price and he had actually quoted me cost.  He then said it was $7,875 for the same watch.  I reminded him what he quoted me and offered a price of $3,500 which made him $600 profit and I would still feel like I got a good price.  I felt it was very reasonable of me to do that in light of the salesperson's mistake.  This way, he wins, I win.\n\nThe salesperson left and spoke with David Donaldson the owner and returned with a price of $6,300.  I told him that I drove all the way back specifically based on the $2,900 price I had originally been quoted.  David then came out and told me that the salesman was new (he isn't...he's been there for at least six months as he helped me the last time I had a battery replaced) and that he couldn't afford to sell the watch to me at that price and furthermore he was willing to lose a customer over his salesperson's mistake.  He said he couldn't afford to sell me the watch because he was a small business owner and it would cost him a month's rent.\n\n$3,500 minus $2,900 = $600 profit for a watch that he had less than a week.  Pretty good return in my book.  \n\nI'm in sales and have people work for me too.  When one of my guys quotes a price and it's wrong, I have to eat it.  I may not like it but it's the right thing to do.  It has cost me thousands of dollars before, but it's the right thing to do.  THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT. \n\nSo yes Dave you have lost a customer but in the world of online reviews and customer satisfaction, the way you treated me will cost you a lot more in missed business from people who read this review and won't like the way you do business.  It's called opportunity loss and your treatment of me will cost you a lot more than the missed excess profits you lost from being disrespectful and unreasonable with a good customer.  Remember, I offered you a price above cost to be fair and you still treated me poorly.  \n\nI then got a call from them the next day asking me to come pick up the watches I had left there for repair.  Really?  How childish and immature is that?  I gladly picked them up.\n\nI then found the exact Glycine watch and serial number listed for sale for $1,795 on www.chrono24.com by Feel Good Watches, Inc. a Scottsdale, AZ reseller. So the watches weren't even owned by Donaldson to sell, but rather were gray market watches that were put in his store on consignment.  I confirmed this with Feel Good Watches personally who indicated the watches were owned by a third party, most likely another jeweler.  David Donaldson was not only trying to gouge me in price, but he was selling gray market watches himself which I think is funny considering the owner's post below referencing other gray market watch resellers.   This just goes to show they are liars and dishonest.  The owner  makes reference in her response to not being able to sell below cost...the cost was $1,795 dollars which was the price the exact watch was available for sale on chrono24.com.  Secondly...I find it ironic they refer to cost when they in fact didn't even own the watches in the first place.\n\nThe owner has made a statement that the watches were properly marked and price.  This is a lie. There was no price tag on the watch.  I know that because the tag on the watch has a number of 3883 on it which I asked if this was the original price and I was told it was the watch model and serial numbers.  The salesperson then quoted me a price of $2,900 and told me what a great price that was.   The salesperson knowingly quoted me the price and even though he had been there 90 days, I would hardly say he was new.    The salesperson  didn't hesitate at all in quoting me the original price of $2,900.  There was no miscommunication on my part.\n\nBOTTOM LINE.  AS BUSINESS OWNERS YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THE LIES YOU CONTINUE TO CREATE.  YOU SHOULD JUST COME CLEAN.  DO NOT BUY A WATCH FROM THIS BUSINESS AS NOT ONLY IS DAVID DONALDSON DISHONEST, BUT SO IS HIS WIFE.  I guess the whole mix up was a blessing in disguise as I would have way overpaid for the watch and I could have gotten it for half what I had offered him in good faith.  Buyer beware.  I'm going to stick with a different brand now and I'll never set foot in this poor business again.  Neither should you.\n\nCONSUMERS BEWARE!"
0,"Now I have never gone in here for anything other that cigs, but they overcharge for those so I dont like them.They also had a poor selection of them (only for kinds I think) That and the biker theme is somewhat scary."
0,"I remember coming here as a kid and thinking this was the best experience ever. I recently went back with my family, because my dad had a coupon for it. After waiting in line for two hours, we were seated, I went and made a plate of prime rib, turkey, and other fixings. Nothing was especially spectacular. I went up for shrimp and crab legs next. The shrimp were decent, but the crab legs tasted a little old, dry, and had a consistency of rubber. After that was the Chinese station. The bbq pork was decent, the flavor was spot on, but a little fatty. The duck was delicious although lacked the crispy skin one would like with a roasted duck. Finally, the desserts, I found mostly everything to be disappointing. The gelato was not creamy, but more icy and too sweet. The cakes were nothing special either. \n\nI can only think of one comparison. As a kid one loves McDonald's with a fervent passion, but once you have had better, McDonald's becomes the place you eat at when you are desperate for something simple and quick. The line at the Carnival World Buffet is anything from that description. I do not see myself going back there anytime soon."
1,This store has everything you could possibly need for your remodel or project. Prices are much less than other tile stores. Wish I found this place sooner.
1,"Had a friend recommend this restaurant when she found out I'd been eating vegetarian lately. Am I ever glad she did! The food was cheap, absolutely delicious and completely veggie. It's a cafeteria-style serving situation, and there were lots of seats, mostly full.\n\nThe spanakopita was great, the cannelloni was also very good and they have ginger beer. The second night I went in, there was a live band playing enjoyable music at a good volume.\n\nI really can't recommend this place highly enough!"
0,"After trying this place for the first time last year when I was in Phoenix and having a wonderful experience, I went back there today and was absolutely disgusted.  As we approached the front door a friend said he thought it looked closed, but it turned out it was open there just weren't any people inside.  \n\nThe place smelled like a sewage plant on the inside, and we immediately turned around and went elsewhere for food.  Luckily my friend said a new Ramiros opened near his house, because I will definitely never go back to this location again."
0,"This was pretty damn close to the most disgusting meal I've ever been served.\n\nI made the mistake of coming here for brunch on a saturday morning with the wifey while being wallet-raped by Danny's Car Wash for an oil change (see review).   It was open and across the street and I'd heard about it, so I figured what the hell. Big mistake, this meal didn't help my mood.   \n\nThe build your own omelette and bloody mary seemed great on paper.\n\nI didn't even care that I had a waitress-in-training that had absolutely no clue what was going on.  After all, I had time to kill.  I guess taking a piece of paper from a diner to the cook and bartender is difficult labor requiring highly skilled and specialized employees.\n\nBut wait!  The bartender doesn't know how to make a mimosa?  A retarded monkey could make a mimosa.  In between flinging feces on the walls and picking fleas out of its hair.  That, at least, would have been entertaining.\n\nSo I'm going over my omelette choices.  No green bell peppers?  For real?  A \""mexican\"" joint with no green bell peppers?  I actually wrote it in, hoping that this was an egregious oversight by the menu-making committee and they did actually have them.  I finished selecting my omelette fixins, including \""chorizo\"".  \n\nI received a plate with a pound of dog food and jalapeno peppers wrapped in an egg.  I'm positive not one morsel of this mystery meat was USDA approved for human consumption, let alone a massive pile of it.  And I'm positive jalapenos are not bell peppers.\n\nYou know what?  In retrospect, this was the most disgusting meal I've ever been served.  \n\nDon't come here for food."
1,I went here on a blind date and the food was better than the date. The service was excellent and very professional. I had the tacos and they were delicious. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the price. I thought the price was a little high for what you get. But overall its a great date spot and a good place for a nice power lunch.
1,"Ok i walked in to this place while i was out there for a business trip and was in need of a cut bad i'm usually really picky about who cuts my hair (because its really thick and curly and can look really bad if cut wrong) but i had a big meeting at a casino and needed to look my best. So this women named Kat came up and asked me what i needed and how i liked my hair cut i gave her a general overview of what i liked and asked her to cut it how she would like it, well needless to say when she was done it looked great. There are people who learn to cut hair and then there are people who have natural talent to cut hair and kat was born to style hair thank you, you did an amazing job. I'll be see you for another trim next time im in town."
0,Poker Face is the name of a kiosk shop in terminal D that is owned by Valor LLC.    \n\nNEVER buy anything there.  It's all overpriced and you can get the same stuff for a 1/3 of the price at Wild Gecko just down the terminal.   They also charge you a 2% up charge for CC purchases.  They don't take any returns or do refunds so it feels like a typical scam shop but Ill give them a chance to redeem themselves.  \n\nTheir number is 702-730-0090. \nThe two contacts on the receipt are:  \ndavidpokerfacelv@gmail.com and\nrockefrost@gmail.com\n\n Ill check with the BBB and see if there are any complaints and ill update this review. \n\nAvoid it fellow travelers!!
0,How do you have a bad experience at a Nordy's? I thought that this was impossible. Let me preface this by saying that it wasn't really the Nordy's that bothered me so much but the MAC counter at Nordy's. \n\nI'll just sum it up in three sentences:\n\nOne....Absolutely could not keep their scheduling on point and caused my friend and I to be late to a wedding. Two....Rude and oblivious associates that would rather have you wait because they couldn't possibly take more than two appointments an hour even though they had a total of count them with me....eight people just standing around doing NOTHING. Three....Its quite apparent they have no appreciation or respect for their customers as I saw them make snide faces at their customers and rudely gossip about customers once they left. \n\nAwful and Absurd. Get a new set of associates for this location. \n\nI'm SOOO glad this is NOT my Nordy's. I'll never come to this location ever again.

Featuring all the standards of a certified parlor, inclusive of a hand pressed di Sorrento brick oven, all wood firing, and imported flour worked by hand it was perhaps with a bit of gluttony that a the decision was made to sample four of the restaurant's four signature pies plus the weekly special but in the end each and every one was an individually shaped, lightly charred, bubbly and balanced success.  Truly a space where the concept of quality ingredients and time honored techniques yield a superior product it was with two golden, creamy arancini that the meal began and then progressing through pizza both red and white, simple and complex it was perhaps most telling that the best slices of the day belonged to the Margherita DOC with a the Buffala Mozz briny funk finding harmony in the hand crushed tomatoes yet not to be outdone the eponymous Settebello also shined as the novel pine nuts and mushrooms added an earthen undertone to the pairing of cured meats.  Truly a place where not a single savory was anything less than excellent it was without hesitation that desserts were selected and again choosing broadly the rewards were myriad; a creamy budino on par with DOCG's for best in town a clear favorite amongst many while the Bella Mela proved just as well conceptualized as the pizzas though ever more subtle - a characteristic ignored by both the Calzone and Zeppole; the first harkening a campfire's smoke and the second soft and supple but both filled to bursting chocolate decadence and all the better for it."
0,"My husband and I dined here this evening and the food was terrible. \n\nMy husband had the gyro with fries. The sandwich barely had any cucumber sauce, over loaded with lettuce, hardly any tomatoes, and the fries were the frozen crinkle cut. No feta on the sandwich and hardly any cucumbers in the sauce.\n\nI had the shrimp eggrolls and shrimp tempura sushi. The egg rolls were mostly cabbage with any overwhelming taste of ginger. My question is where is the shrimp in the shrimp eggroll? The sushi was only 2 cold fried shrimp, seaweed, and rice. (Which can be usual for a $4 roll, not a $6 roll, and the shrimp were not devained.) They could have put some of the cucumber they skimped on in the sauce for the gyro with the sushi just to give it a little something else.\n\nWe have been here before and it was decent, but they have recently changed some items on the menu and its not good anymore. The only thing they have going for them is the service. We have always had the nicest servers whenever we've been. However, I have never once had a manager come to my table to see how things were going."
0,Dissappointing to say the least. Pizza crust is good but the add on's are just thrown on to a piece of cheese pizza and called good. Ray's still has the best by the slice! I won't be going back...
0,"From what I had heard, I thought this would be way more of a dive bar. Definitely not.  It had a nice feel and cute couches if you were lucky enough to get one.  However, the actual people who went there were a bit much.  If you have a bouncer, please escort the rowdy persons out.  I was sitting at the high top tables and a drunk patron kept running into me.  I ended up wearing half my drink.  The staff saw this and did nothing.  \n\nOverall the rest of my experience was ok.  I liked the tree.  It is just kind of an average, everyday bar with a great tree.  \n\nThe bartenders were jerks.  Inattentive.  There was one with curly hair, she talked to me like I was an idiot.  From ordering to closing my tab, you would have thought I was speaking another language.  I doubt I will go back to Paul's."
0,"From what I understand, Yelp is to review unique and fun places, not your typical everyday joints. For this review, and those rules, please accept my apology. What I have to say must be heard.\n\nYou see, Arby's is an amazing place. It is lumped in with the McDonalds and Burger Kings of the world, when in fact, it should hold a different place in the hearts of Americans. \n\nWhen I was 16 years old I landed my first real paper paycheck job at an Arby's in Holland, MI. I thought I was big time. I made $8.00 an hour. I scored free grub from time to time. I flirted with the lizadies who came through the drive through window. What else could you want? \n\nThrough my time at Arby's I learned a man named Russ Umphimheimer owns the most Arby's under an umbrella corporation called RTM. He also owned a few other joints I think a Hardees (never seen one), a breakfast roll place, etc. Arby's was his crowning achievement though. He owned an empire of roast beef and curly fries. I met him once and shook his hand. He had a bunch of gold rings. \n\nAnyway, now you have the background of my review, and you see I am only giving this joint 2 stars, you have to wonder why. I will tell you why..  no green beans on the menu.\n\nThrough out parts of the mid-west and the south there are renegade rebel Arby's. They were not bought out by RTM during Russ Umphenhimer's Arby's empire take over. Think of these places as the rebel alliance in Star Wars, and the RTM Arby's as The Empire. Russ Umphenhimer can be Darth Vader if you want him to be, but he's really not that mean. \n\nRTM (stands for Results Through Motivation) set a menu standard through out his millions of Arby's. Every menu had to be the same. You can always tell when you are in a rebel Arby's because they will have some random stuff on the menu, such as green beans. The franchisee operator will sell you green beans (at least they used to), but hardly any of the Arby's would order them because they were all RTM Arby's and thus, couldn't be free to set the menu as they saw fit. \n\nThis Arby's had it's typical roast beef sandwiches. I opted for the beef and cheddar sans red ranch sauce, cause I think it's gross and I saw somebody dump a whole tub on their head once and run around chasing a girl. Bad juju right there. I also ordered the chicken fingers, which are back on the menu after a couple year MIA stint. Topped it off with an order of curly fries and a jamoca shake. I can't spell jamoca. Sorry. \n\nThe food I ordered was great for a fast food joint, and worth the extra dollar to upgrade me from a whopper or big mac. However, to have a truly 5 star Arby's experience, I lust for the day where I can order green beans off of a fast food menu and have a hearty chuckle about this fact. Until this day, fight The Empire, and support your local rebel Arby's (they usually have those old signs \""Arby's Rost Beef Sandwich is Delicious\"")."
0,"Sesame octopus good, weird unagi sauce. Way too much rice!  That worries me they don't trust their fish..."
1,"I haven't had lunch at Cafe Soleil yet...but the bakery happy hour is absolutely worth a visit (maybe even an extra 1/2 star for value!).  The espresso drinks are well done (on 4 of 5 occasions) and the savory croissants are lovely, as is the blueberry cream cheese croissant.  The homemade lemonade is delicious and refreshing, especially with free refills.  I've lucked out on days with blueberry and raspberry lemonade...yum!  Local cheeses and farmer's market goods as an added bonus. \n\nSpend a lazy afternoon here, reading the paper or working on a paper.  Avoid the hectic farmer's market crowd on Saturdays."
0,"This company has terrible customer service.  I contacted them about a repair that they had a warranty on.  The warranty was for 1 year.  The part broke after 8.5 months and they refuse to even discuss it with me.  The woman on the phone yelled at me like I was an idiot and said that since I called another repair company to fix it, they wouldn't warranty their work.  At the time my ceiling had water pouring down so I needed to get it fixed ASAP.  I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
0,"I have been coming to this Petco for 2 years....   The only thing good about this place is the store manager but even as nice as she was.... it didnt make up for what happened.\nI took my dog in to get groomed.  They were understaffed (which nobody told me about when I dropped him of for his appointment.)  so I had to wait longer. Nobody told me it was going to be 2 hours longer than what I was told so I tried to be patient.  Waited.  Waited... I was ignore.....would have been nice if someone had given me an estimated wait time.... then again...they had the first time and look how that worked out.    But I was still keeping my cool.  Hey...things happen.  Then a man walks in with 2 dogs... didnt have an appointment and asks to get both his dogs a nail trim.  NO PROBLEM!!  That's what they say.  So my dog and I are waiting for a total of 5 hours to be taken care of and this guy just walks in and is helped right away.  Understaffed.  That why I had to wait so long.  More like...not a priority.  Thanks a lot.  \n OH...BUT IM NOT DONE YET..... I took him to my work to show everyone the new \""do\"" and when he rolled over..his undercarrage was wayyyy uneven.   Nobody can really see it so I'm like...whatever today sucked I'm not going to worry about it... and then everyone asks why his tail is so uneven...and then my friend is petting his fur around the neck and asks why he has a dreadlock.  For real guys??  You didn't even brush him out??   I use to tell everyone how great this place was. Sadly, I wont be back"
0,"After the reviews we were fired up to hit this place up when we rolled into town.  However......after ordering the Hatch burger and the truffle fries we waited forever.  When the food came both items were cold and uninspiring.  After about ten minutes we got the staff to pay attention to us.  We did get replacements for all and the second round of burgers were better.  The fries reminded me of gravy not truffle style, not sure what that was all about.  The 2 stars is due to the fact that they comped us the food.\n\nTIP FOR the PLACE - WARM up the hatch chiles so it doesn't take away from the heat of the burger."
1,"Sin City is a regular stop for us. Good layout for a comedy club, funny opening video reminding you to turn off  your cell phone and be courteous to those around you. Not a bad seat in the house. Have seen many good commedians and a few really great ones. Did i mention Todd Paul....a sword, an apple, a unicycle, hat juggling...you got to see it. Anyway VIP seats are front row(s) not worth the $10 unless you want a chance to be up close and personal with one of the Dolls. We usually just hang out in the neighboring bar until the doors open then grab a seat along the back wall. and remember - real men don't drink out of blinky cups, see the show you will understand why."
1,"I had the crispy duck with drunken noodles, tom yum soup, and Thai tea. While I love the crispy duck and Thai tea, I do not like the tom yum much. This place is a must-visit for any foodie tourists."
0,"When parking uptown, they are really your only option.  Which is fine, as some of their lots have reasonable rates.  My reason for the low review comes from the user experience side of thing, and their overall customer service.\n\nMy main problem with them (aside from rude people), is that there is no way to update your payment information online.  My credit card was cancelled, and upon receiving my new card (mid-March), I called immediately to update my information so, come April, they would have updated information.  Obviously I would have much rather done this all online, but alas, there was no other option but to call.  They assured me that the new card was placed on file, and we were good to go.  Fast forward to April 5th, and I receive an email saying that my card did not go through and I would be fined an additional $25.  THEY HAD CHARGED THE WRONG CARD.  They sent me this email on Saturday afternoon, and I immediately called, only to be told that the people who handle payments don't work on weekends and I would need to call back during business hours (the girl could have been a lot nicer).\n\nI call first thing Monday morning, and explain what happen--not in an accusing tone by any means, because I'm well aware that the likelihood of the girl I was speaking to having made this mistake was slim, so why yell at the messenger?  She immediately responded in a defensive tone, saying there is no way that error could have occurred, and it was my fault for not giving them the new information.  I tried to explain again the course of events, and she would not have it.  She updated my credit card information, now for the second time, so let's see if it goes through for May.\n\nOverall, here is how I feel:\n\n+Tremendous amount of parking options offered in Uptown\n-Poor customer service\n-Poor user experience\n-Overpriced\n\nIf you're going to take hundreds of dollars for me every year, at least give me decent people.  And if you don't give me decent people, then give me a way to do what I need to do online so I don't have to deal with them."
0,"HORRIBLE......price, service, food, experience.  WILL NEVER RETURN.  \nThe doors were unlocked and there were people in there eating.  Then the owner came out of the back and said we are closed until 5 pm.  It was 4:30.  I guess proof that the service is horrible and slow was that lunch ends at 2 and they are closed from 2-5 but the couple at the table was still there eating.  Anyways they did let us come in and they offered us a glass of water...that took 15 minutes to get to the table.  When a server finally arrived through the front door all sweaty, he came to bring us menus.  Now it is 5:15. He brought us water and then started to take it away because we already had some, we asked him if we could keep it and it was a good thing we did as he never came back to refill glasses.  He never asked if we wanted anything else to drink and we were going to order a new kind of beer.  We ordered.  It was. 40 minutes before the first plate came and we had no silverware....when we asked the server said, no I gave you flatware already, really? do you see any here? another 10 minutes before the second plate came out and it was cold and was sent back.  There was a bone chip in the sausage.  At each table you could here the servers saying they were out of pierogies and then they were out of baklava, then they were out of......the owner lady started chatting at tables and told everyone she was out of pierogies because she only makes them on Tuesday her prep day..it was Friday.   So all the food must be leftover if she only preps on Tuesday.  VERY DISAPPOINTED, WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.  my one star rating is one star too much, but the lowest score you can give.."
1,Wanted to try something new for lunch in Old Town Scottsdale last Friday. With a recommendation from a friend we decided on Cornish Pasty. There was such a selection of different combinations wrapped in a pastry shell. I chose the Pilgrim. It was so good. It was Thanksgiving in a shell. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it took quite a while to get our food. It wasn't very busy and we only had an hour for lunch. We ended up having to take most out food to go. I wouldn't have minded the wait if we had more time. It looks like a cool hangout.
1,"This is my new go-to place for bubble tea. I think that the value for the price and quality is better than most places here in Vegas. I've been here a few times and while it hasn't been consistent most of the time, this is the place where I would frequently visit for my boba needs.\n\nIt's a fairly new spot that's been open for a few months. I've gotten turned in this place by the recommendation of some yelper buddies. It's located on spring mountain next to lees sandwiches.\n\nPopcorn chicken - a Taiwanese speciality, the one at fat dumpling is nice and crispy on the outside, and moist and juicy in the center with an interesting seasoning. They give you an OK amount for the price, but I think they should give more.\n\nSmoothies - order the jumbo size. It's the best deal in town. It's the Big Gulp of bubble teas. All of the fruit they use are real. The tea also has good flavor as well. I've never found boba quality as high as Half & Half tea house in LA, but... It's good here. Sometimes a lil bit too soft, but better than a lot of places in Vegas. My total for a jumbo smoothie with boba was 5.14, not too sha-bay!\n\nWhat's also great is that they are open later than most places. While most of them close between 8:30 to 10pm on the weekdays, this place closes at midnight. The same time the werewolves come out..."
1,My friends and I have played at this course for two straight years during our annual labor day golf trip. I love way the course uses the natural dessert. There is fine wildlife that may walk through the course. My friends and I saw a fox in the front 9. Im also a fan of the flavored towels they have. They definitely make those hot days bearable.
1,"One of the, if not, THE BEST video game store in town.  Definitely worth the drive coming from Scottsdale.\n\nThe Gaming Zone is exactly what their name is.  Very real and unbiased employees, a good selection of used retro titles, and a very clean place that holds tournaments and just plain fun.  Wide selection of video games to play on the spot.\n\nTrading in games for either cash and/or credit is very fair and down to earth.  Unlike other re-sellers or video game stores, The Gaming Zone will give you fair deals for the games you want to sell.  Never had to return a used item from these guys.\n\nOverall, this place is a solid store with solid service and a solid selection.  Did I mention there is an arcade section full of some child hood memories?"
0,"I've heard good food and decent location - service reminds me of visiting Germany. Mean, direct and no interest in having you there. Bartender/manager needs to go back to Berlin.   Totally happy to visit and within 5 minutes I was asking what  I did to offend??  We have amazing Scotttsdale bars and hangouts- this is NOT one of them."
0,"Live in Phoenix and heard of this place. Happened to be in the area and so we stopped in for a piece of pie. Have to admit that from the outside I was impressed\nUnfortunately the pie was a disappointment. It cost $6 dollars a slice and was not freshly made. They did not have any two crust pies, everything was a crumble and refridgerated\nIf you want good pie go to Alpine California, that is the bench mark"
1,"I recently stayed at South Point and it was awesome! They gave us a 2 for 1 coupon for the lunch buffet and the service was awesome. The food was so so, BUT THE PEOPLE ARE REALLY NICE. They refilled our drinks constantly and were polite. The food I would give 2-3 stars, but the service and deal made the experience even better."
0,"stayed here for the first time & was disappointed tho I gamble & frequent the buffet here often...accommodations were fair @ best...small room & bathroom...check in was fairly painless though it was almost midnight so no line to deal with...\nmy son's had a basketball tournament out here in Vegas that weekend so the Saturday night Prime Rib buffet was really crowded...went early (5:30pm) to BEAT the crowd & still waited over an hour =(  once we got a table, it was off to the carving station & quite possibly one of the best cuts of PR I have ever had, something you don't usually expect from a \""buffet style\"" restaurant...\n\nno frills (read cheap) casino...need a place to park your bod for the weekend, this is your place..."

1,Three words. Amazing Green Curry. Period.\n\nPolite and homely owners for the place. Good for veggies too :). Lovely little quaint place serving piping hot amazing Thai food. *on nom nom*
1,"Very good homestyle cooking. The Fish and Chips are fresh every Friday and are second to none in Phoenix.\n\nPlace has a dive feel to it, but that is the charm of it. Anyone who expects classic dining should not eat here. You get a good meal at a decent price. Servers always polite, and meals come very quickly."
0,"I have been to other GBK locations (London) and was in the mood for a great burger but I was so disappointed! I typically would have given the other location I visited 4 stars so I had expectations. I ordered a buffalo burger. \""Sorry, no buffalo today.\"" So I said I'll take a regular burger with cheddar. Plain. No sauces. No salad. No toppings. And an order of sweet potato fries. \""Sorry, no sweet potato  today\"". Ok, onion rings.\n\nSo I wait for what seems like an eternity for my burger (and the place only has about 4 tables with customers...mid afternoon) and the burger is wrong and the onion rings are burnt. The burger has lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, mayo and salsa. I send it back and it returns less than a minute later. I asked the waitress if they just scraped off the toppings, to which she answered no but when I lifted the bun, I showed her the remains of the salsa. Walked out without eating lunch. Won't be back to this location."
0,"Service has become horrible at this place! Todays date..May 31st, 2013 at 8:16pm. I usually go about 5-6 times a month to this location in particular and have noticed it going downhill. Finally this last experience inspired me to write my first Yelp review. Two people in front of me and it took twenty minutes to get through the line. They only ordered one dish each so it's not like I was behind a football team or something. \n\nKid behind the counter was as inefficient as I've ever seen plus looked stoned. Eyes half shut and glazed over. He struggled to put together each meal. African American kid.. All smiles and chatty but to the staff talking and talking to the girl sweeping the floor while the lines just stacking up behind me. \n\nManagement didn't do a thing.. Most of the people were in back slicing and dicing oblivious to the front. Finally I get my time consuming order 3 tacos. Lol. It's been carried around the kitchen, half forgotten on the grill. \n\nNow it's time for checkout. Standing at the register for 5-10 min.. What appears to be a manager rolls past me to grab a drink at the soda machine. Starts chatting up the girl restocking the lids at the soda fountain who I later find out is my cashier.. After they joke around for awhile he rolls back past me and heads back to slicing and dicing in back. \n\nCashier finally comes up.. No sorry for waiting nothing.. Asks me what I had, I reply chicken tacos and ask for a drink. She runs my card, bags the food and walks away.. No have a nice day not a word. \n\nI'm home now.. Live less than a mile away started writing after finishing 3 luke warm bland tacos.  Probably not going back. Until they upgrade their staff.  \n\nOne more thing... Get rid of the singing.. It's demeaning to your staff. I'm sure they don't make a ton of money and to have them drone out some half hearted song about cheese or a new customer is revolting.  And really...after waiting for the length of time it would take to wrap up a meal at a fine dining restaurant.... Do you think my moods going to improve with the staff taking time out to sing?? It only perpetuates the situation. Putting a little more feeling behind the droning isn't going to be the solution either.\n\nDefinitely need to train your current staff to kick in when there's a wait or higher some new people. I'd get rid of whomever the manager was... Ridiculous!"
0,"My girlfriend and I saw this place at the Vegas StrEAT in Fremont and decided to give it a shot.  We ordered the Korean french fries topped with Bulgogi, fried egg, kimchi and sweet potato.  It was $9 and came in a small box.  There were very little Bulgogi meat.  The whole thing was drenched in siracha sauce.  Very disappointing for a $9 french fries.  I wish I have gotten the red pepper garlic fries from the Fuku Burger for $2 instead."
1,"I love it here! Every time I'm in Vegas I always end up eating here for several reasons 1) it's open 24 hours 2) great selection of food; from breakfast to late night dinner menus 3) prices are reasonable 4) portions are quite large, 5) great ambiance and 6) of course the food is good!\n\nIf I had to choose I'd prefer this place over Cheesecake factory. They also have a Grand Lux at the Palazzo but I don't think they are open 24 hours. The place is pretty large. You hardly ever have to wait long to get seated. And service has never been a problem."
1,Great menu. Pasta was delicious. Pizza flavor was excellent but unfortunately crust became very soggy fast. Will definitely be back.
1,"My favorite happy hour spot... And my cousin agrees!\nWe have come here several times for their fabulous kettle chilli verde pork and martinis. Both of these items are on the happy hour menu. Other favorites are the flatbread, big ass burger (yes it's ginormous), and their amazing fish tacos. \nMy best friend loves their huckleberry margaritas.\nI've been coming to this place for happy hour for the past 7 years and will be a continuing customer because of their delectable and affordable bites. Thank you RF!"
1,"Very good buffet but it doesn't quite measure up  to Wynn's.   Main gripe, the king crab legs were water logged and a little bit too salty.  The best, try the rack of lamb w/ the mint jelly.  Very fabulous.  \n\nWhat also sets the Wynn buffet apart is the decor/ambiance.  At Wynn, it's trendy, modern, hip.  At Bellagio, it's old school.  It actually makes a difference in the overall experience for me."
0,I think that if it we less expensive this would be a just fine low-cost charlotte diner. But alas a tuna melt costs almost ten bucks and is mediocre. It seems a diner cannot be both over priced and plain. Charlotte cafe is both. Why go here when there are much better alteratives that taste better and cost less? I won't be returning.
0,"Nothing special about this place other than delivering all the food either overcooked, undercooked, or the wrong version.\n\nMy wife ordered the half and half. The pancakes were doughy but sin e our waitress had better things to do she ate the outer sections. Her egg thing with ham bacon cheese ect. Some how came out with chicken instead. My wife eventually got it changed and they were none to happy. She gave her food a 3 star.\n\nMy patty melt was ordered medium to MR came out shoe leather super well done. Once again no waitress to complain to. I had also ordered the .95 cent add on bacon to the burger. She instead ordered me a side of bacon for $3.50. She got to pay for that out of her tip money since she would not fix it on the ticket. \n\nNeedless to say my dogs ate well. Except for the burger there might have been something wrong with it. I have two hounds who eat most anything but would not finish the awful patty melt for me.\n\nIt gets 2 stars for the pancake edges my wife ate and I tried. very good. Would have been nice to have had it all to eat."
1,"We went back to\nCowbell and had exceptional\nService. The food was quick, tasty and everything we were craving. Much happier with our experience this time around and will keep it in our rotation of restaurants. Kudos to the management for taking complaints seriously and making major improvements in service."
0,"**Disclaimer: I absolutely hate leaving a bad review but this one deserved it...we've dined here once before.\n\nFood (& ratings):\n- Beef chow fun (2):  I'm giving this dish a 2 though the previous year's experience merited a 4.5.  The beef dish is the only one I am rating b/c it is the only one that all other facets of this bad dining experience stemmed from.   \n\nWe were about 1/3 through this dish when I noticed that several slices of the beef was RED amidst the noodles.  Ok I enjoy my steak medium rare but not when it comes to something that is supposed to be a stir-fried dish!  Asked waiter, Jimmy (who had an EH attitude all night) to take a look.  Without one word (no apologies on behalf of restaurant) he walked away with dish.  \n\nTen minutes later, he dropped a new dish somewhat resembling beef chow fun onto the table:  beef was in fact cooked but the noodles blended together in a soggy mess.  Most noodles were still stuck together.  Disaster.  \n\nWorst part of night?  Besides the terrible attitude, Jimmy charged an EXTRA dish that was not ordered.   Had to send the bill back also.  Inept AND careless?  Oh my, what a horrible dinner.\n\nWhen:\n- Christmas 2011\n\nCrowd:\n- Any within Caesar's hungry enough to venture forth\n\nInteriors & Service:\n- Interiors (4.5): always liked it - double layered walls & ceiling designed in such a way as to instill underwater feel.  Full goldfish tanks link the entry.\n- Service (0):  yes, a zero.  Jimmy was terrible, terrible, terrible.  \n\nOverall:\n- Not ever going back"
1,"I have been here 4 times and never had a major issue. \nLunch is only $5.99. If at $5.99 you expect high end, then go somewhere else. \nHave realistic expectations and you'll like it just fine."
0,Over priced! Terrible service! Not worth the trip- go somewhere else...
0,"I did not have a good experience AT ALL. There were was a very limited color selection, which was the first disappointment. The girl that did my manicure was playing with her phone the entire time and distracted. When she was working on my cuticles she hacked at them haphazardly and, what do you know, cut me. TWICE. As I was bleeding all over she just looked at me sheepishly and said, \""Sorry.\"" \n\nShe did a rushed job on the polish and it looked terrible. Not impressed. AT ALL. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. My friend had a pedicure at the same time and her experience was not a positive one, either.\n\nStay away."
0,"I am so confused. Rave reviews for this place...how is this possible? The food is decent...i have had far better in less pretty places. The service is strange. We were sat before another couple who came in before us. When I asked for a bar menu, I was looked at with disdain and told they have liquor. The busboy tried to take my plate as I was still eating our appetizer. We had to ask 4 different people to get serving spoons. They serve curry in a GIANT bowl...I do not know why anyone looked so shocked we would ask for a spoon. We got 4 different spoons, ranging from ladel to sugar spoon.There was a whopping 4 shrimp in pur phucket shrimp and the veggies in the curry were closer to raw than cooked. The flavor in the phucket shrimp was salt and more salt. Our pork appetizer came with a dipping sauce of....Siracha. That is it. A bowl of Siracha. The meat was not tender and hard to eat. Maybe because this is Peoria, people do not have a clue? You would be better served at the very unglamorous Line Thai down the street. I won't come back. Even if it is free."
0,"I've seen three Cirque shows.  Mystere which was very entertaining, wall to wall acrobatics, non-stop exciting, Ka which was very disappointing - forcing the acrobatics into a silly storyline, and now Zarkana which was pretty boring.  Too much childish filler between acts and too few really good acrobatic acts.   Even with the Las Vegas local discount it was $186 for two in the way back.  Can't imagine what tourists who paid $400  for 2 tickets up close felt about this waste of money.  Maybe if I'd had a few beers before and during I would have felt differently."
0,I ate here a couple times cause its close to homr but I rather drive farther for better service. Drive thru take a long time and for what u get lousy food. This place is not what it use to be. I rather go to the ine on 67 and Thomas or mr leno any other filibertos just nit this one
0,"Do NOT bring your satchel to this place!\n\nI decided (poorly) to bring my Harrah's play to this hotel. I am a rated Harrah's member, so get the standard RFB comps. After staying at their \""Flagship\"" I am honestly thinking about switching to the competition. If this is the best they can do, I need to move to MGM or someplace else that will respect our play better.\n\nI understand I'm not a 7 star rated player... but you never know, I could be one in a few years... I booked a room in the forum tower, smaller and modern decor. When I got in, I was moved to the Roman tower, 3rd floor. My view was of the pipes, outside access staircases and the side of a building. At 2:30 I discovered that the shower was not working, neither was the drain. I called and asked to move. They told me they would send an engineer up to fix it and they were completely booked.\n\nAnyway, after about an hour or so of waiting, and the engineer telling me that he was going to need another 45 minutes to fix it, I asked again to move. All of a sudden they were NOT fully booked and I was moved to an equally old, not renovated mess. \n\nThe only reason I am complaining about a free room here is because of the LYING, the BROKEN SHOWER, and the SHOVING ME IN A FAR WORSE ROOM THAN I CHOSE online. If I knew that was going to happen, I would have stayed at PH like normal.\n\nMy host will hear about it, or not, as I may not be back to Harrah's at all."
1,"This was a last minute trip to Vegas. This time I wanted to stay away from the strip. Its a great hotel, very clean, all the workers there nice that we ran in to. Room was big. my wife loved the restroom/shower area. The price was right. (off season) its only about a 15 minute ride to the strip. I would stay there again for sure in the off season."
1,"I would eat here every weekend, if possible. I love Good Food on Montford. Love.\n\nLooks are deceiving, but I think that is what they were going for when they picked this location. From the outside, it's nothing flashy but a solid frame with floor to ceiling glass front windows. The interior is modern, contemporary and very tasteful. They nailed the minimalist and cozy ambiance. They have each table set and ready for your arrival.\n\nI really like the small tapas plate concept. You can pick and choose various dishes to share with your partner. Awww, romantic. Tip: Get 2 steamed buns so you won't end up fighting over it; it is that delicious you each want your own. I'm going to make it my mission to try each item...the quail wraps and Korean beef were very flavorful. They focus on seasonal dishes using local and/or organic options. Fab. The wine selection was very good and the servers make great recommendations. Last, but not least was the dessert. They had the most fantastic blackberry ice cream (yes, it was a few seasons ago) paired with a cake or cobbler dish. Mmmm.\n\nThe service was fantastic! Just the perfect amount of attention balanced with privacy. The most perfect dining experiences are when you lose track of time, deep in conversation, eating fantastically prepared food, and dishes are each a work of art. You will get all of that at Good Food. \n\nMy favorite. Just wish they would accept reservations."
0,"We were looking forward to some bar b que ribs tonight. However, after seating us and ordering drinks, they tell us there are no ribs tonight. What kind of bbq place doesn't have ribs? \nNext, we order fries- oops! Sorry, they don't have those tonight either.  Really?! \nWe ordered the bbq sampler, which included 2 ribs and so we asked how would that order be handled. We were told the chef would substitute the ribs to his preference. Really?! How about our preference or giving us some options? I had to point that out before we were offered some options. \nFinally, the two stars are for the food, which turned out to be pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but still good."
0,"I purchased carpeting for my nursery from furniture plus. I walked into the store and loved it, it was like a little ma and pa shop and i always like doing business with the underdogs. I worked with a man named CJ, who at the time was very helpful and made me want to do business with him. I left there after receiving a reasonable quote and went to home depot to see what they could do. They price matched me, i went home, thought about it and decided i would rather do business with the smaller company who had offered to install it the very next day\n    I called cj back and paid down the deposit of half the amount due. He then told me he was unable to come the next day due to another job. Well we decided the following wed would work. So i made sure we were home wed bc they were coming between 8-10 am. No call, no nothing. Finally at 11, i called store and they said he was out at another job and he would call me. Finally he got a hold of us and he said the carpet wasnt even in arizona like he sold it to me thinking it was. So we rescheduled for friday between 8-10. Again, no call, no nothing. I once again contacted store and to my surprise, he was at lunch and i spoke with his very polite mother. He returned my call and said, oh it wasnt on the truck again. Lets shoot for the next wed. I will know by tues night for sure if load comes in. Another lovely wed comes and goes and he actually calls me to tell me the carpets not here. Finally the next week, 2 hispanic gentleman show up at my door and say \""carpet install?\"" after i received no forewarning that the carpet was actually here. The workers were very efficient and did a good job, as for cj's customer service, if u are not spending a lot of money, dont expect good communication. But i will say he will be sure to follow up on making certain he gets paid!\n   I hope on the furniture end, their customer service is a lot better than his was. \n\nFrom a disappointed mommy to be"
1,My stylist is FANTASTIC. been coming here for years. Would follow her anywhere. The salon is pretty. They always have little yummies to nosh on. Staff is quite pleasant too.
1,"This place has perhaps the best Sushi in AZ.  The Maki Rolls are a little outlandish at times, but good.  The Nigiri and Sashimi is where the place shines.  Fish is very Fresh and very high quality, and well served.  It comes at the right temperature, not  too cold as at many places.  And the Deep fried ice cream is too die for, comes with deep fried Bananas & Strawberries!.  Staff is Friendly, makes good suggestions and allows you to order as you go, unlike a lot of Sushi places.  The Sushi Chefs here are nice and attentive, but definitely are kept busy."
1,"My husband got me a gift certificate for a one-hour massage with Glenn.  I have to say, this was probably the BEST one-hour massage I've ever had.  When you go in, you fill out a sheet describing any problems you might be having, the amount of pressure you desire, etc.  If you're a first-time client, he'll have you fill out a questionnaire afterwards so you can offer any suggestions.  I'll definitely be referring Glenn to my friends and look forward to setting up my next appointment with him.  His prices are also VERY reasonable.  Also, he is located in Suite 501, not 518."
0,I was there for couple of drinks with my friend who was stay a night at the hotel. \nIt was the worst experience i have ever had in a bar in Pittsburgh. When i got there my friend was having dinner at the table and i joined we. I was there only for drinks so i asked the server if i could have a drink but she suggested re restaurant is closed so i will have to get a drink at the bar area. Shortly after that i see her serving other ppl around me in the dinning area and when i asked her about it she told me it was last call and they were also having a drink so it was ok. Honesty it was a weird experience and i wish i could complain to somebody about it being it's such a big chain of hotels. I asked the server If I could talk to the restaurant manager she said sure but the manager never showed up.
0,Was expecting a lot more for the price. Their focus is on seafood and I was expecting at least average is not better but it really missed the mark for me. Portions small and seafood not its freshest. Ambiance was nice but a little dated in the lighting and furniture.
0,"This place really isn't worth one star but since that's the lowest option I have...\n\nI have been here twice and really didn't enjoy the first trip.  I enjoyed tonight's visit even less.  We only came here to eat because our favorite restaurant was so packed we couldn't even find a parking spot.  I ordered a cheese crisp with chicken on it.  It took over a half hour to get our food.  We sat there and waited and waited.  Our waitress at one point said our food should be up soon and then we didn't see her for another 15 minutes.  When my food arrived it was cold.  Not wanting to wait another half hour for a replacement meal I scraped all the cold chicken (half of which looked disgusting, btw) off the cheese crisp and just ate the cold cheese/tortilla.  My mom's cheese enchilada wasn't cooked either.  The cheese wasn't even remotely melted.\n\nOur waitress took another 15 minutes to bring our bill and asked if we needed boxes.  We said no.  Another 5 minutes went by and she came back to get the card.  By this time I was irritated.  She obviously had too many tables and couldn't keep up with her workload.  When she finally came back with our card she asked again if we wanted boxes.  I finally told her that she should tell the people in the kitchen our food had come out cold.  She apologized but after the excessive delays and the cold food, it's just not enough to make me want to eat here again.  The only good thing I can say is the chips were good."
1,"It's a small place with a large amount of flavor.  I've eaten here twice and loved it both times.  The soups are great and full of flavor.  Be careful when saying how hot you want it, I tried medium and it had some kick."
1,I go here at least once a week for the lunch buffet. They always have a good variety of meat and veggie dishes. Some rotate and some classics are always there. It's my favorite place to eat.
0,"I will never get food from here again. I placed an online order for delivery and was given a delivery time of an hour. About 40 minutes later I got a call from the store saying there was a problem with the online order and they took the order again over the phone as well as my credit card number. Turns out that they double charged me, got the order wrong, and I had to wait another hour to boot. I tried to call to get a credit, and after a few days got a text that an amount not matching mine had been credited to a card ending with 4 digits not matching mine.  This was a month and a half ago. The owner won't return calls and the staff won't help. I disputed with the bank and he won't call them back so now I have to cancel my debit card to get my credit. \n\nStreets of New York you've seen the last of me."

0,"I really loved this place at first. Started with a complementary Belly Dance class, Sheri is an awesome gal. Then I moved into having my yearlys with Mary Anne. She was attentive to my life and she had a great presence about her. Spent time talking to me and keeping notes. I met Dr Jones once in that time and was less than impressed with her bedside mannor but hey, I had the choice to see Mary Anne instead, so I did.  \n\nMy biggest issues were the front desk staff had VERY poor customer skills. Very much like a typical Drs office which isn't what this place is supposed to be about. \n\nWhen I became pregnant eveything started off great, supportive etc with Mary Anne. Then once I told them that I wanted a home birth but had not found the right midwife for me yet, everything changed. I never felt welcome again. They did my appointments but not with the same warmth I felt prior. My last appointment spured my midwife search faster than anything before. I met with Dr Jones. She began stating were I would be delivering the baby and I reminded her my chart said I was doing home birth to which she bluntly said \""Then why am I seeing you?\"" Maybe blunt is her style, maybe she had a valid point..I don't really care, because it was extremely unprofessional.  I can't vouch for her skills as an OB but her demenor is less than desirable. I would expect a person truely passionate about babies and women would gladly assist their paying clients in their quest for the best care available when they themselves don't offer the serivce...Networking with other providers...maybe I'm wrong. \n\nAfter my birth I did go back with a breast issue my lactation consultant couldn't address. I was in tremendous constant pain. They gave my breast a glance with me just pulling my shirt aside, misdiagnosed me as having mastitis. I returned again in more pain. I could barely function with out crying. Dr Jones saw me and pressed directly on the intensly inflamed area on my chest and I burst into tears. Unbelievable. At least I got an amazing Breast Surgeon referal out of the deal but that was my last straw with them. I have never returned, not even for my follow ups. \n\nBecause they were so cold to me during my pregnancy and after, they lost my business and my referals for everything else."
0,"I'd give this place 3 stars if I was only reviewing the Bar...but on occasion, I take my family here for dinner...and as usual, we were very disappointed with the food quality and taste.  This is one of the last standing local joints in the Copa, so they know that they do not need to raise the bar on themselves due to a captive audience.  The quality if what leaves the kitchen is un professional and bland.  Boneless BBq wings - my daughter was nauseated while eating these, her normal fav dish.  Chicken Pot Pie - RAW dough at the bottom;  soupy mess in between...Asian Chicken Salad with their special ginger sesame dressing???  This was tasteless and the chicken was in long strips and also without taste.  Lettuce was in 6\"" strips and a very miss matched sort of greens...\n\nMy son ordered the Traditional Wings medium w/ hot on the side...these were as always very tasty.  See, not all bad, but if you want a meal and not bar food, go to KFC."
0,"I decided to check this place out to see what all the fuss was about.  Four reasons to not bother:\n\n1. Despite being in a strip mall at the intersection of two major roads and close by several upscale neighborhoods, the \""Palace\"" was completely empty at 12:30 on a weekday.  Never a good sign.  Guess this place doesn't do a lot of lunch business. \n\n2. I had the lamb kabobs which were dry and gamey like overcooked deer meat.  Meh.\n\n3. The decor leaves much to be desired, the food leaves much to be desired, and the service was slow and grumpy.  Did I wake them from their midafternoon siesta?  \n\n4. Even Olive Garden has more variety, more consistency, a more pleasant atmosphere and better value.  \n\nWith so many better options in Vegas, why would you come here?  Oh that's right.  No one does."
1,"As experienced Segway riders, we are always looking for something more than the usual \""introductory tour\"". We saw the 2.5-hour \""Advanced\"" tour, and signed up. Due to weather, we ended up changing days at the last minute, and Dianna was very accomodating. As it turns out, we were the only ones on that tour, so we ended up with a \""private\"" one! \n\nTremaine (sorry if I've mispelled it!), our tour guide, was AWESOME!!! After a quick test to see that we really did know how to ride, we took off. He took us all over the place, visiting neighborhoods and areas that we never would have tripped upon ourselves. He obviously has a passion for Charlotte, having grown up there, and it showed. \n\nWe got our full 2.5 hours (and then some), and think that this is probably the best tour we have taken so far on Segways. If you are an experienced rider, I would definitely recommend taking one of the advanced tours. And, ask for Tremaine!!!"
0,"Just another nuevo-trendy place with average food at best.  Six bucks for \""made-to-order\"" potato chips which, after quizzing the waitress, we came to find out are just potato slices that they fry when you order them and not before.  Even more comical were the $6 deviled eggs.  Yep, you read that right - this joint has managed to make that old picnic staple into an \""in\"" entre.  Nothing spectacular about them at all - just 6 deviled eggs in a little wooden tray.  At least we only had to pay $5 for ten ounces of a mediocre beer (Stella) to wash it down.\n\nNot that it was all bad.  It's a comfortable place with a decent decor.  But in short, if you are concerned more about buzz than quality or value, this may be the place for you."
1,Amazing Italian. Very pretty place hidden from tourists. A local spot and hidden gem.
1,The reviews pretty much say it all. The food here was very very good. I ordered the chicken and mushroom crepe. It was hard to make a decision on the menu because all the food sounded so delicious. The crepe was the best I've ever had. The presentation on the plate was amazing and the flavor didn't disappoint. The service here was very good and the servers knew who ordered what without asking. The restaurant is very busy so expect to wait at least 30 minutes for a table. I would have given this place five stars but they had accidentally seated another party at our table which caused quite a bit of confusion and frustration. The food and service after that made up for it and my group had all forgotten the drama after enjoying the delicious food and wonderful ambiance.
0,"Wow, we got absolutely terrible service. The only reason that this place is getting more than one star is that the good was great. \n\nWhen we first sat down, I asked about the happy hour specials and was told what they were but that we couldn't get them and would have to pay full price because we were seated inside. I told the hostess three times that I wanted outside as he was bringing us in, but I didn't want to make a fuss about it. We asked to be moved and the girl said that would not be possible, but what we could do is go to the bar. My friend and I went up to the bar to get our happy hour specials while our third friend who doesn't drink waited at the table. While we were getting out drinks three different people came up to my friend who was still at the table asking what the problem was and where we were and what we were doing. They were so rude to her she wanted to leave.\n\nPro-tip: if you offer different prices at different spots in your restaurant people will go for the cheapest.\n\nThe rest of the time the waitress was very rude to us and even ignored me several times when I asked for our check. I don't want to come back here if I can help it."
0,"I'm a middle of the road fan of Mad Mex (see my review of the Robinson location if you'd like for more details), but wanted to provide a review based on the location and ambiance of this branch of the restaurant.\n\nShort answer, it may be the worst Mad Mex location and here's why:\n\nThe restaurant is consistently too cold, winter or summer\n\nDim lighting through the restaurant (not in the good ambiance sort of way) or blindingly bright where the only window is located\n\nSuper awkward seating (first you get to brush your butt past your table-neighbor's face when you sit down, then it is your turn to show you theirs when they leave!) that is too close together\n\nDifficult to get a parking spot in the neighborhood\n\nI hate to sound picky, but it is true that when you can't feel comfortable in an environment it is likely that you won't enjoy yourself, and that is exactly what happens to me every time I have no choice but to eat at this location. Try one of the many other locations for a better experience if you can!"
0,"Wow. I thought PIZZAM was really subpar. So much that I wouldn't go back. I gave it one star for the service - the people working there were quite nice, and the process was quick, too. The food however - ew! We ordered 2 pizzas, salad and a meatball sandwich. The salad was really basic, dressing out of a bottle. We didnt care for the \""crust\"" that was like cardboard, or the toppings - ie, the sausage tasted like what I might find on a frozen Tony's pizza!  I was really hopeful, as I live close enough to walk, but it just didnt work for us.  If you are in the area and really want pizza, try down the street at Picazzo's - much better food and atmosphere."
1,"Whoever came up with the esthetic concept of this restaurant needs to take it down a notch or twelve.  I can't imagine that Gordon Ramsay REALLY wanted his name and face on literally every printable surface.  Sure, the guy has a reputation in the business for having kind of an ego, but this is a little much, even for Vegas.  \n\nDude does a good burger, even if my medium-rare order came out medium (hence, minus 1 star).  Kelp Caesar salad was also very good.  The fries were so crispy that a few were actually kind of hard to chew, and the portions are definitely generous here.  \n\nGood service, uuuuuugly uniforms.  Ramsay, if you're reading this, fire the design team."
0,"Where do I start?? We just got married on October 12, 2014. My husband and I are locals and we wanted a nice wedding but also keep it small at the same time. We had a lot of people coming from out of town so we wanted to make it special. I didn't have any reason to think that it wasn't going to be nice. Danielle Meyer was very sweet and very helpful so I thought everything would be perfect as everyone's wedding day should be! I believe we got the dream package and it cost $544 we were unaware that the pictures included in the package of only the ACTUAL ceremony. They started shooting pictures from the time I was in my dressing room until after the ceremony. We thought we would be able to choose 18 pictures out of all of the pictures that they took. We felt like this should've been made very clear, but it wasn't. They also knew my daughter was going to be the flower girl and we assumed everything was okay because they never said  that the flowers were not included in our package. Come to find out at the very last minute right before I'm getting ready to walk down the aisle I ask where my daughters flower basket is? The coordinator looked at me like I was crazy and said we never said that we wanted one and that it wasn't in our package. I couldn't believe it what kind of flower girl doesn't have a basket of flowers to throw down the aisle!?!? She said it was going to cost an additional $35 I believe it was. I had somebody go let my husband know what was going on and thankfully we had the money on us. We just felt like this was very unorganized and just another way to squeeze more money out of you. So two days later when it's time to go view our pictures we start looking and that's when they tell us we can only choose 18 from the time the ceremony started until it ended. My husband immediately got upset because nobody told us this. And then the lady came in rude and looking at us like it was our fault saying you should of read your contract. I looked at her in disbelief on how she could be so careless about the whole situation. Sorry that we have a million other things going on because we're getting ready to get married and we didn't read your small print contract. There was a total of 140 pictures and I believe they wanted $595 for all of them or 40 bucks a piece. In every single one of our ceremony pictures the candle is in front of us ruining the picture completely. The background is blurry, people are blurry. The pictures were downright terrible! I could understand if the pictures were flawless like the ones that are hanging up in their buildings but they weren't. Not even close!  What was worst about this whole situation was how they handled their upset customers. Like it was our fault. Just rude and nasty! Of course we were upset  but for them to be so hostile towards us was not right. The supervisor in the photo department offered us 3 pictures to make it right but honestly I don't know if it can be made right since this day only comes once in a lifetime. Word of mouth is the best advertising and my husband being a bartender at the Golden Nugget gets asked all the time where they should get married and he will make it very clear to not come here. They don't care that it's your special day all they want is your money and a lot of it!! RUDE! RUDE! RUDE!"
1,"I rescued my ball of canine fluff (Harley) from the Humane Society two years ago. What I didn't know was that when I adopted him, they decided to neuter him before I took him home. When I went to pick him up Harley had a brand spanking new cone around his neck. So came the search for a veterinarian stat and I needed one who could be trusted to take top notch care of this mischievous dog. \n\nI learned quickly that a dog is expensive and especially with medical bills, shots, office visits...and that's just hitting on the basics. As I was visiting the Petsmart one day, I came across the Bandfield Pet Hospital conveniently located inside the store. I decided to begin chatting with them to see about pricing and they told me about their amazing deal. For between $25 and $35 a month, they offer a service where you get unlimited office visits, several shots, an annual dental cleaning and many more benefits for your animal. I cannot tell you how many times this service has come to the rescue for me. \n\nI absolutely love the Bandfield staff. Harley has spent his fair share of time in the doctor's office and every time he visits, the staff is extremely friendly and nice. They always get Harley in and out quickly. The vets know what they're doing and they take great care of the animals. After a visit, Harley always leaves happy and refreshed and normally with a clean bill of health. \n\nThe greatest part about Bandfield is that they are conscious of the economy and know they don't push unnecessary medications or products just to make money. They really do look out for the customer, both canine and human, so for that I am a forever fan of Bandfield! I think I can speak for Harley as well."
1,"1st of all we chose to stay at Hilton Grand Vacations for a night before staying at Bellagio for the week. The choices at Hilton GV were sparse so they recommended Griddle Cafe at SLS. What a fabulous recommendation!\nThe cafe is located inside SLS, which is a very short walk from monorail stop. The place is usually busy, but wait times are usually less than 5min. \n\nWe were seated right away. The service was quick in getting our orders and drinks to us, despite the large parties around  us. The ambience was casual and relaxed. There is a bar area for the single diners or people that want to sit near the kitchen area.\n\nThe food: we ordered Senior Juan's Steak tacos, 2 Eggs over medium with potatoes, multigrain toast, and the Fiesta Scramble with chile-cheese bread. We didn't order pancakes - should of, they were the size of pizzas!! Everyone around us had them and they looked delicious! They are supposedly known for them.\nThe prices are phenomenal for Vegas!\nSe\u00f1or Juan's Tacos - 13.95\n2 eggs any style, with fruit, griddle potatoes and toast - 9.95\nFiesta Scramble - 13.95\n\nThe portions are incredibly large as we didn't been come close to finishing. The waitress told us we should share the scramble next time! All in all a good choice if your in the area or have monorail access."
1,"Being from Kentucky, I have a deep dark desire for biscuits and gravy.  So when I ordered it here in Vegas, I was expecting a pale, underseasoned paste that someone called gravy.  I could not have been more wrong!  These people know what they are doing.  The roux was browned perfectly and the mix of seasonings made this the best gravy I have had IN MY LIFE!!  Gigantic portions that I could not finish made this a place I'd come back to town for!\n\nWhen you go (and you know you want to), ask for Natasha.  Great service with a warm smile."
0,"I went here for a 'nice' steak dinner. however, i think 'nice' is actually 'bleh'.\n\nAll I wanted was a big, fat hunk of delicious meat and some healthy vegetables. Apparently they have vegetables but I wouldn't call them healthy. They have green beans, and I'm sure they are delicious with all the butter and bacon they are cooked in but I am 100% sticking to my New Years resolution. I asked instead if I could have fresh green beans cooked by themselves. My waitress said NO.\n\nNO?! you mean you don't have fresh vegetables?\n\nEverything they have is already premade and nothing is fresh. GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe steak was bland and I pretty much used an entire mound of salt for flavor. It ended up being like $20 bucks after tip. Totally ridiculous. \n\nI don't understand restaurants that don't use fresh vegetables and nothing can be cooked to order. that totally grosses me out. I will not be back. If I was by myself I would have left when I found out nothing was fresh, but I was with people and didn't want to insult them because one of them chose this place?"
0,"Yelp, u embarrassed me. from all the spectacular reviews, I thought this place would be a great place to bring my wife for a treat. We were put into a room and the only thing a lady asked us was how long of a massage we wanted. My wife was never given an option for a female masseuse. Another thing, we were never asked if we had any problem areas or areas to focus on. The communication barrier at the place was terrible. That should have been a sign for us to leave, but we stuck through it since Yelp said this place was so awesome. \n\nI had a fantastic lady with halitosis although she attempted to mask it with mint gum. I got super relaxed at one point but her phone went off; all downhill from that point on. She took some more calls through the whole session. Annoying! Another problem were the coworkers talking to each other in Mandarin. They said some words that were insulting to my wife and I. My wife bit her tongue and didn't say anything because she wanted to snap at them!\n\nAt the end, it was awkward paying the bill because our massage people hung around the front counter till they heard what they got for a tip. \n\none generous star for the value \none generous star for the cashier - the only person we understood at the place\n\nwhat about the massage review? I'm fat and my masseuse crushed me like I was skin and bones. She had a strong, but not so soothing touch and the same goes for my wife's masseur."
0,"So, their IMAX is not a full IMAX screen, yet they charge the full IMAX price.  We just saw Interstellar. If you go, bring a blanket. The movie was 2:45 minutes. We froze the whole time making the experience miserable. \n\nGo to Harkin."
1,"Good place for a pretheater meal. Very crowded even at 5:30.  Make reservations. Well dressed crowd for the most part, with a big bar scene\n\nHad the bone marrow. Three huge bones. Felt like Fred Flintstone. A very good version (very reasonably priced). Was saturated (at least fat-saturated) after that, but still managed to have the hangar steak (very good, and fortunately very lean). In my fat-induced haze couldn't remember what my wife and daughter ordered. Something healthy no doubt. They seemed to enjoy it. Had the Aviation and Sazerac cocktails which were quite nice."
0,"UPDATE: I previously gave this place 4 stars (see original post below from when the restaurant was called Zaytoon) but there now seems to be new ownership, new name, new menu and a new indifference to the quality and flavor of food being served. What happened to this place???\n\nORIGINAL POST: Bravo for any and all authentic, independent Middle Eastern / Mediterranean restaurants in this area! This one just happens to be delicious, use high quality ingredients, be family owned and operated, and reasonably priced. There is a common theme (maybe the saffron or another spice) that makes the dishes distinctive and consistent... but also a tad uniform. Still well worth a try!"
1,"My server Alyssa was amazing. Very kind, always had a smile on her face and made sure everything was good with us. Also her manager Marc was amazing and making sure we enjoyed our service. I will definitely be returning and telling my friends about the wonderful service and food."
1,"Moved back to the east coast and am sorely missing my 24 hour fitness membership - especially the cost and the classes.  I've been a member of various gyms over the last decade, and 24 hour fitness seems to go the farthest in making sure its members are happy, are not restrained by high costs or contracts, and have choices in equipment and classes.  If they open one in DC, I'm sure they'll snatch away business from the other fitness centers here in no time!  Reason for 4:  pay for towels, not completely nationwide yet, and the machines aren't as nice as some of the fancier gyms."
1,"Review is for Restaurant Week Fall 2012 menu:\n\nThis was a four course meal with no choice for each of the courses.   \n\nCourse 1:  Carpaccio Of Mediterranean Caught Fish With Fresh Herbs, Citrus, Afrala Sea Salt And Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  The fish was so delicate and so tasty.  The olive oil and the salt made the dish.  It was very good.\n\nCourse 2:  Grilled octopus with roasted peppers and assorted grilled mushrooms.  Another winner of a dish.  The octopus was so tasty and the mushrooms were very good. \n\nCourse 3:  Grilled Mediterranean sea bass.  It was the whole fish with the head cut off and placed to the left of the opened fish.  The server cautioned me about avoiding the collar bones which were attached to the meat.  A very tasty fish, perfectly cooked to preserve its moistness.\n\nCourse 4:  Greek walnut cake with Kaimaki ice cream.  Very tasty cake and flavorful ice cream.  \n\nThe meal came with a basked of bread--2 slices in my case--I was dining alone.  There was a small dish into which the server poured olive oil for dipping the bread.\n\nI really like the room.  The decor is very nice that I'd like to call modern rustic.  The lights have small filaments in a twist formation that give off a pleasant glow.  The furniture is modern.\n\nService was quite good given that there was a party of about 20 people that came about 10 minutes after me and they took a lot of time.\n\nA few things keep this from getting 5 stars.  Between the second and third course, the waiter removed my bread and olive oil.  As he was doing it he said, \""You're done with the bread, right?\""  I was so surprised by his question and his taking that I just shook my head in agreement.  Maybe he thought I had eaten the main course and would soon have dessert.  Maybe I should have jammed a fork into his hand if I had one.  He'd already taken that.  \n\nThere were several small bones in the main part of the fish.  I could just imagine being a judge on Chopped and having my say about that.  Very surprising.\n\nLast, I wish they'd shut the door to the outside.  It was Saturday night and not too far from the entrance are some table games at the Cosmopolitan.  There's also a lot of foot traffic out there of 20 somethings who'd spent part of the day at the pool--not just swimming and ogling the ladies--but also indulging in the spirits of their choice.  They were loud and it carried into the restaurant.  Close the door.\n\nI am a fan of Milos.  I will return, and I think I'll do so for their lunch special.   it should be quieter, too!"
0,"With the superfluity of fro-yo places in town, U-Swirl just doesn't hit the mark.  They offer a variety of self-serve flavors but only two of them were tart!  Their original flavor just tasted... well... OFF.  Good quality fro-yo is flavorful and creamy; at U-Swirl, I would have no clue what flavor I was eating if I didn't read the label and the consistency was icy.  \n\nAnd my biggest gripe of all was there was no mochi!!\n\nI'd give it 1.5 stars but I guess I'll up it an extra 0.5 for it's modern decor."
1,The best place in Charlotte. They are consistent with there service and quality of food. Me and my fianc\u00e9 dine here weekly. Never had a bad experience.
1,"Nothing like a quick fix when you're having an insane wing craving, which tends to happen to me at least once a month or so, although there was a time that I will unabashedly admit that I ate at BWW's at least 4x a week.  Don't judge!\n\nAnyway, my friend and I came in here the other night around 1am with a wing-craving so strong it ached in our bellies.  The bar area was open and it wasn't super busy.  Our server was great so we got beers right away.  We ordered 18 wings and did half spicy garlic, which is the only sauce I've ever had there, and also medium.  I couldn't really tell the difference between the two sauces, to be honest.  \n\nIt's true that they are not the best wings as they are quite a bit on the scrawny side, but they hit the spot all the same, as they always do.  They are also SUPER salty and it can get to be way too much, but wash it down with some beer to cancel out the high salt content and you're golden."
1,I've been going to Sushi in Summerlin for almost 11 years.  I'm there once a week and they know me by name and what I like.  The sushi is fresh and they are always testing new rolls.  I prefer Sushi in Summerlin to Sushi Mon and Yama Sushi.
0,Robert the owner is a scam artist.  He took the trade in and gave a suv and for 4 months he doesn't get a loan for the SUV he just keeps giving out those 30 day dmv passes. And also for the 4 months he never paid off the trade in so the loan defaulted and went in to repo. So I say to you all don't allow this man to mess your credit up.
0,I have to agree with Herbie H. Review. I love the Aria but they have to take their buffet up another notch. The selection was so so and the taste was lacking. It also gave me a school cafeteria feel that I hated so much back  in highschool. So that's why I give this place a sorry 2 star.
1,"When we first moved here, we stayed at the M resort and took advantage of their spa.  The staff is great- incredibly friendly and the spa itself is wonderfully relaxing. \n\nBut the 5 stars is really based on Anthony in the salon.  \n\nHe is not only a superb stylist, he totally understands what we want and explains what he's doing and why.\nPlus, he blew us away by remembering who we were, with details, the second time we came in.  Anthony has long term clients in us- and I highly recommend him to anyone looking for an excellent stylist."
1,"Convenience is the word. It's close to the freeway, Chevron gas fair prices but not the low price guys, really good variety of last moment stuff and pretty good car wash with varied levels of service.\nStore is clean and well lit in and outside. Feels safe even middle of the night. Been here many times and I recommend for variety and safety reasons I pretty much use this store when out late.\nGood store."
1,"A prominent \""bridge\"" from Bellagio to Aria Hotel and Casino. It's my favorite spot in whole City Center now.\nHowever I checked web site and found out that The Cosmopolitan is not a part of City Center at all. In my opinion, it's organically synced with the rest of buildings and is an enticing addition to them. \nI'm staying there next time!\nAnd one more thing, check their packages on web. One I really suggest all my single but cooperative peers is \""Three adults for the price of two\"" night stay."
1,"Earl of Sandwich is a great place not only because of the food, but because of the people that work there too.  \n\nAfter my not so stellar experience at Earl of Sandwich, they contacted me to apologize and encouraged me to come back. \n\nI did, and ordered the exact same sandwich - the Original. This time, you could see their assembly line running like a well oiled machine producing my order quickly, and efficiently. When I unwrapped the sandwich, steam rose out and cheese oozed from the sides. The ratio of roast beef to bread was perfect and the horseradish was generous. This is the sandwich of my memory. \n\nThank you Earl of Sandwich for doing such a great job!"
0,"So after driving by this place everyday I decided to give it a shot. I originally went there on a lunchdate thinking it was a sit down and order establishment. Well I was wrong so at that point we went elsewhere. So I went back for carryout tonight. In a nutshell I'm not impressed by it all, but there are some silver linings.\n\nService - Meh, middle of the road. Not bad, not good. The employees looked annoyed and didn't want to be there. But I was asked about sides and options and got a \""thank you\"" after transaction so I can't burn them too bad for not whistling while they work. \n6/10\n\nFood Quality - I ordered the steak quesadilla cause I love fried tortillas and lots of cheese inside. Well, I was very disapointed. Granted they press the tortillas there and fry it up in front of you, mine was not very fried. I worked at restaurants and cooked quesadillas on \""mexi night\"" and mine were always crispy and hot. This one was merely warmed up and retained little heat during the 1 mile drive home. While the quesadilla wasn't much better than taco bells version, the chips and queso and guacamole were excellent. Very good guac!! It was rich and chunky unlike canned stuff. Maybe I'll just stick to burritos if I go there cause the steak was tasty. \n5/10 only because of the guac, 3/10 without it.\n\nPrice - $5 for that undercooked quesadilla is a sham. $3 tops. The chips and queso were also a bit pricey at $3. I spent $8.50 on the quesadilla, chips, queso and guacamole. I felt like it was a $5 meal in the end.\n3/10\n\nExperience/Vibe - Very plain much like other tex mex joints like Qdoba and Chipotle, only a little worse. The dining setup is awkward and weirdly lit. \n5/10\n\nOverall - 19/40. \n\nWhen the sides impress me more than the main dish I can only give two stars tops. Im sure it would be closer to 3 if I ordered the burrito since thats just easier than a quesadilla but I don't really like burritos that much, so guys lets work on that tortilla frying and better portions!"
0,"Went there for dinner at 6pm. Got crowded at about 8pm. Full house.  \n\nBuilding was nice on the outside, but did not expect the dumpy location around it. Thinking Diamond in the rough? Not quite. \n\nService was good until it got busy then it was Ok. I had to go up to the bar to cash the check cause I didn't see waiter for a while.  \n\nFood was neutral.  Not really bad but not great. Garlic Naan was really the best thing.  I was expecting more flavors but it was ok. They got my order wrong (chicken instead of shrimp) & shrimp came out rubbery (they take tail off). Small shrimp. Chicken tica tamdoori was good but they brought that out like it was an appetizer?  It was my husband's main entr\u00e9e. I'm not sure what happened with that,  but we weren't going to complain in front of friends. Plus the onions & such were not cooked all the way. I don't eat raw onions (they barely cooked them). \n\nSmall portions for price.  \n\nDon't know we would go back unless friends  absolutely wanted to go there.  Too bad because I thought we found the best Indian place in town :("
0,"It was obvious when we walked in the door that they didn't want to service us.  They told us to come back in an hour, so we did.  A young boy was playing with a blown up disposable glove and my daughters thought it was cool. My 6 and 8 year old daughters were very well behaved while they got their toes painted and only the older one talked to me quietly about what was on the tv.  My younger daughter asked for a pair of gloves to play with and when they didn't hear/understand her, I took a pair and gave them to her. The technician became enraged about the \""stolen\"" gloves. She refused to give the other daughter a pair, even though she was asking nicely, because I didn't ask for the first pair. I told her I was happy to pay for them and she still refused. Seriously? We're great customers and I'm a really good tipper!! Finally, another technician handed over a pair and shouted \""Your kids are annoying!\"" Who says that in front of a kid????"
1,Great food. Attentive waiters. And they let us just sit and chat for 2 hours after we finished our meal. Didn't bother us till we actually asked for a bill. Great atmosphere too! Highly recommend the place.
0,"The lunch here is mediocre at best.  Bland and unhealthy, the ambiance is nothing special.  The best I could say is that it's not very expensive (though you can walk around the corner north on Clark and get the same food for half the price)."
0,"I almost went here.\n\nMe and my group sat here for 20 minutes or so and didn't even get a glance from a waiter.\n\nWe were drawn by the lure of $1 rita's and tacos but that deal doesn't start til midnight.\n\nWe were there at 1130p and decided to bail after we had a near miss\nwith a member of the wait staff who cruised by our table, smiled and walked on by."
0,"Boy I gotta tell ya - what a HUGE disappointment this place was. I've been dieting for the last 5 months and have finally reached my goal - and then some, so I decided to treat myself (good behavior) and have some fast food. At first I thought Wendy's until I saw that famous In-N-Out sign and pulled right in. The service was impeccable, the food? Not so much. I ordered the single cheeseburger with fries and a root beer. The bun on my burger was greasier than the burger itself - I could barely hold on to it! The fries  -  although hot  -  we're as dry as cardboard and actually tasted like cardboard...even my root beer was weak - how the heck can you screw up a root beer?!?! Five months of hard work and my reward completely and totally sucked. Thanks...I really should have gone to Wendy's - well, next time!"
0,"I am so sorry for the low rating , but my experience just fell short. Maybe it's because I was there before most of the workers, stalking the parking lot with great anticipation. I knew this was going to be an EPIC lunch! It was an EPIC fail.... My feelings were hurt :( I wanted the panang in the reviews. I wanted the pad thai gasm! I waited about 40 mins after placing the order for two lunch specials and that was fine.. Given I was extra early! But when I made it home, that's when the devastation hit! I wasn't given a delisicious velvety panang it was a grease bowl.  Man, it was just really greasy and seperated. No spice no flair. The pad thai had no flavor in fact it didn't even have one lick of flavor. Flavorlessnesss....hmmmmm... Oh that's it! The sever never asked me a spice level!!!! My earliness must have frazzled him! \n\n\nOn a high note the peanut butter dressing on the salad was very good as was the soup!! That let's me know this place has great potential! \n\nMoral of the dramatic story! Give people a chance to warm up before going! I don't think I'd given them a ompletely fair shot, so I will return one day to try again."
0,The staff seems knowledgeable and courteous but the hours of operation are very random.I've been here twice to buy ammo and the store was closed when the sign says they are supposed to be open. My advice would be to call first to make sure someone is there before you make the trip.
1,"**** My 200th Review! ****\n\nFogo de Chao I believe loosely translates to \""Meat Tornado\"". I was warned by a friend not to fill up on the salad bar and starchy side dishes before the carnivorous category F5 engulfed the table in a dizzying barrage of beef, lamb, chicken, and pork.  \n\nThere are 16 different types of meat brought to your plate. You can control the flow of the meat parade by using a little stop-n-go coaster, but who wants to stop the meat parade?\n\nHighlights for me were: anything lamb, bacon wrapped chicken, the garlic beef, and the mashed potato side dish (seriously good). \n\nLowlights for me were: the sirloins, the pork sausage, the corn fritter things, and the emptiness of salad-type salad bar options. \n\nThe staff were top notch, even for a bunch of younger dudes, they communicated well and were very professional. Well done sirs. We had an excellent wine pairing. They brought out a nice desert for our birthday girl and everyone left a little more swollen than when they came in. On a side note, go to the salad bar last, what my friend called \""the pusher\"" and steer clear of their bathrooms unless you want to hear guttural sounds the likes of which you can never un-hear."
0,"I lived in Charlotte for a few months and joined this gym primarily to take some group fitness classes. It was cheap, and I enjoyed the classes, but the facilities are just OK. I might have been spoiled from my previous gym with personal TVs attached to each cardio machine, but something that really bothered me about this place is that they don't have towels! I found this kind of odd and disgusting since it didn't exactly seem sanitary! I'm not a germaphobe, but watching people lift and then leave sweat marks on equipment didn't exactly motivate me to follow their lead. I'm used to putting a towel down while using machines and then wiping them off afterward. The club does have paper towels and spray cleaner, but people pretty much only use them on the cardio machines. I ended up bringing my own towel, but it was inconvenient and created more dirty laundry for me!\n\nIn terms of membership, it was easy to sign up, but it has been a headache to cancel. I moved back to CA for work at the end of January and in order to cancel I had to prove that I was moving more than 30 miles away. Before I moved, I provided them with copies of my employment letter, intent to vacate from my Charlotte apartment, and a copy of my plane ticket. However these documents were apparently not enough to \""prove\"" to them that I was moving out of the area. What's worse is that the girl at the front desk told me it was sufficient, and nobody from Sports & Fitness or ABC Financial (the company that deals with all their billing) contacted me to let me know. \n\nSo after not getting a cancellation confirmation, I called them in February to only find out that those documents were not valid. I had to fax over a copy of my bank statement showing my address change. I finally got a letter from ABC last week saying that they will cancel my membership, but it will not go into effect until the end of March. I tried calling ABC, reasoning that I sent in my intent to cancel in January, and with their 30 day cancellation notice policy I should only have to pay for February because it was THEIR communication failure. Nonetheless they refused to budge and were completely unhelpful, even after speaking to a manager. Seriously poor customer service! They claim they sent me an email notifying me that I needed to submit another form of proof, but I checked my trash, spam, inbox, everywhere and there's nothing! I even asked the supervisor if she could forward the original email to prove to me that they sent it and she said that was not possible! So now I have no choice but to pay for 2 months of gym membership while I'm thousands of miles away."
0,"Love the food and the happy hour where you can experiment and try several dishes, sort of a Spanish tapa restaurant. Chicken lettuce wraps are always a winner!\n\nGreat decor, cozy, reasonable prices ... BUT a consistently uncaring, careless almost arrogant service all three times I've been here. And the wait staff isn't young and inexperience so I'm at a loss why they can't be more customer-service oriented.\n\nShucks. Love the food, so maybe take-out is the way to go or just avoid this location."
0,"$150 for an old tv, $90 for a bike with a rusty chain, frayed brake lines, ripped seat, missing chain guard, and flat tires? What??!?\n\nYou can buy a brand new bike at Walmart for $80. They also had no clothing for kids under 2 that wasn't ripped, badly stained, and overpriced. They had a very nice electric coffee carafe, yeah I opened it and it was encrusted in old coffee grounds (at least I hope that's what it was). \n\nPerhaps I was spoiled by the Salvation Army back in Ohio but even in the ghetto one there you could still find used items fairly priced and with life left in them. I guess I thought in a nice town like Tempe, they wouldn't put out overpriced crap for sale."
1,"Friendly and caring service. Great prices, delicious house sharer. Sweet port wine and cheap beers. :)\nLove the warm and relaxing atmosphere."
1,"I am just another person confirming what was already said... I must secretly admit that I am relieved our service issues didn't just happen to me because I'm American and needed to get with the program....\n\nWe walked in and there were people at two tables and one patron standing at the counter by the cash register.  The rest was empty. We weren't sure if we were supposed to seat ourselves or wait to be seated. After standing there for a while, we sat down.  We were sitting a while when I approached the waitress and asked quietly, \""are we supposed to order at register first?\"" She snapped, \""I am the only waitress for the whole restaurant. Could you give me a minute?\"" So I figured out that meant that it is indeed waitress service...\n\nWhen she finally got to the table, the service was fine. They were out of all varieties with courgette (zucchini).  I didn't comment but think it is a little strange because summer is in season... Nonetheless, the food we were able to get was delicious! \n\nMy boys ate 2 baskets (15 pieces each!) of the tofu veg dumplings...\n\nCash only but they have an ATM inside.."

If you follow them on Twitter, you'll see all the specials (they were awesome during the Pirates season). \n\nI haven't had a chance to eat here yet, so I'll update my review once I do.  I've heard from trustworthy friends that the food is also excellent, so be sure to try James St!"
0,Not enough valets and it isn't even busy. The front desk people very professional and friendly. The room is like a small room in Manhattan the spread has dirty on it.  One of the managers was kind enough to move me to a new room which was 100% worst than my previous room. I come to Vegas alot I'd never  stay here again.
1,"Hello Zink, sorry for forgetting about you for so long, that's embarrassing considering I live nearby! My first thought walking in here was, what wonderful ambiance and decor! The lighting is warm and inviting and the modern look translates well to the creative twists on traditional american cuisine offered here.\n\nThe service here is excellent, friendly and charming without being too intrusive. Water refills were right on the dot, every time my water glass was close to being empty it was refilled posthaste. That was quite a feat considering they weren't very large glasses and I go through water pretty fast. The soft pretzels that come out while you're waiting are delicious and the mustard dipping sauce was pretty good as well. I ordered the herb encrusted trout with a bean and rock shrimp succotash. It was sooo good! The presentation was whimsical with succotash served in a miniature iron skillet, I couldn't really detect too much flavor in my herb encrusted trout but the basil oil reduction that came with it proved very flavorful and aromatic. The succotash was probably one of my favorite parts of the meal. It was flavorful and well seasoned, perfectly cooked, and the rock shrimp incorporated into it were succulent and added a nice dimension to the textures present in the succotash. Excellent!\n\nThis place definitely was much better than I expected. Now keep in mind that it won't be an eat here every night type place due to the prices, but on the next occasion I'm feeling like a nice night out I'll keep you in my mind Zink."
0,"The food was 3 out of 5 stars but the price was right. Lots of flat screens which was nice. Our food came out fast except we had to wait nearly 25 minutes for the cookie skillet desert. If that's usual then it would of been nice to have been told it would take that long. That's excessively long in my opinion and the reason why I won't be taking my family back. Also, it says it's kid friendly but there were no kids meals listed in the menu. The waitress apologized and read them aloud to us. It would of been nice to have it on the menu."
1,"Perfect Barbers! My sons have been to various shops in town over the years then we found an amazing barber we loved. Then he just got to busy and was impossible to book with. That's when I found this amazing Spanish barber shop in the heart of the city! Mesa is the best! Appointments are not required but if you have your head set on a certain barber I recommend it. If you want a certain style and you don't speak Spanish just bring a pic. They will get it every time. They have seen 5 different guys here always great! I AM PICKY too! Fades, tapers, etc Cuts are 15$ and fast without all of the barbershop ego! Doesn't matter what color you are they got ya! Tip em' I give them an extra 5$ on every cut because looking great makes my guys feel great!  Gracias al duro trabajo de estos chicos no amo esta tienda! no hablo espa\u00f1ol, as\u00ed ;-)"
0,"What used to be a great fun hotel and party place to stay, hang out, get great food and gamble (and even win sometimes), is now like a senior citizen, creaking at the seams and very tired. Room appointments were old. High school style featureless showers and bath, with shower head straight out of the YMCA. Lumpy mattress and a bed that sinks in the middle. Lighting insufficient to make the room comfortable at evening and WIFI that doesn't go beyond 2 bars - insufficient to stream or really have 3-4 windows open. One of the sinks didn't drain and a grumpy plumber arrived who drilled for 30 minutes to get it working. Noisy refridgerator.\n\nThe casino itself is equally aged and featureless. Gone are the stunning hostesses in green outfits... replaced by haggard irritated staff who run around but never someone a drink. Grumpy valets outside want you to pull right up to the bumper of the car in the front of the queue though there is only the two cars in the entire valet section. Front desk check in took 30 minutes. Buffet choices were full of dry meat, oily pastas and potatoes, over sweetened desserts without finesse.\n\nNeedless to say, for the same money (room of $100 a night), right on the Strip, there are now many choices and we won't be back.\n\nRoom Tip: Best tip - don't come to the Rio."
0,"This bar transport from Iowa City is all over the valley, but unlike the Iowa version I feel it has no redeeming qualities. Bad food and funny tasting tap brews. Girlfriend's fake ID got stolen there, man, having a girlfriend under the drinking age sucks, I'm glad that's over."
1,"Awesome thai food find in Gilbert! We loved the duck curry, mango curry and coconut ice cream. Service was awesome and everyone was so friendly!! Will definitely be back."
0,Excellent and fast service during lunch hours. Over priced Mediocre food.
1,"The BEST rice I've ever eaten. Ever. If I was on the show the best thing I ever ate, that might just be the dish I'd highlight. It tastes like its made with sweet cream butter. It's interesting and addicting. Great specialty drinks. The layered enchiladas were very good."
1,"Love this truck! The pork slider is a no brainer. Great tasting, flavorful, yummy. Hubby had the combo beef, pork and chicken plate and he enjoyed it thoroughly.  I like that they keep their calendar up to date on their website so I can find them when desired. \n\nDefinitely give them a try. The plates are huge and will feed you for several days - bonus!"
1,"Great breakfast, and it's very convenient being in the THEhotel if you are staying there. I ate here when THEhotel first opened, it was great then and seems to have maintained its consistency even many years later. I had the french toast which was a lot of food, my mom had just the fruit and some toast but everything really was quality ingredients. I will absolutely be back next time I stay at the THEhotel."
0,"I had bad service here today- besides the nice man who helped me find my books. But other than that, the cashier and Starbucks cashier were both in a huge rush, bad mood... Once someone has an attitude, they give YOU an attitude. And hmmm... I have quite an attitude now."
0,closed - this is now la canasta.
1,"Staff is hysterical, entertaining, knowledgeable and kind. Michael and Jackie are the best! So impressed. Be prepared to laugh, great chemistry!"
1,"Had a great lunch today at FEZ (thanks Yelp!).  I had the Casablanca Chicken Sandwich with the sweet potato fries.  Yummy!  This place has multiple kinds of fries you can pick, how cool is that?  \n\nVery trendy decor, not overly busy (didn't have to wait for a table), good service.  \n\nSee ya soon!"
0,"Came in for a quick to go order the staff was talking amongst them selves and yelling across the restaurant jokingly. \n\nI tried to order the a bread bowl but they were out of the bowls. The girl offered to comp me extra prices of bread to go with it so it so I ordered. I get my order and \""the entire store is out of bread\"". It was kind of like oh well we are out. I came later so I kind of understand the lack of bowls but they offered something they couldn't follow through with which was annoying. The store overall just had a very unprofessional atmosphere which was irritating. I feel like I paid $6 for a small cup of soup from a bunch of kids which wasn't the experience I anticipated. Will probably continue to go to the boca park location from now on."
0,"Came here to watch a game between DENVER Nuggets and LA Clippers. Traffic going to the parking garage was barely moving. It's kind of expected for big sporting events but when we finally got to the parking garage there were no spots anywhere. People were just driving around with nowhere to go. We were there for almost 25 minutes before we could get out. There was no overflow parking, security were just waving people out. Overall it was very disorganized. People who could not find a spot were heading over to Luxor so we had to park at Excalibur just to get away from the traffic that was hardly moving. We ended up missing the first quarter of the game. Two weeks ago we were at MGM for the hockey game and it was nothing like this. We were very impressed at how smooth the flow of traffic was and going to the parking garage was very easy. Mandalay Bay should take lessons from MGM."
1,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet:  I feel like I always want to eat here every time I'm in Vegas!!!  \n\nWhat I love about this place:\n- French onion soup is delicious! \n- Outdoor seating offers a perfect view of the Strip and the Bellagio Fountain show\n- Service was attentive and prompt\n\nThere's always a ton of people here, so make sure you make reservations - if not, expect to wait about 45 min - 1 hour."
1,"everytime i go to vegas, this is THE place i go to get quiche. I think you can only get it for brunch so come early! it is so so soo good.!!   the crust is crispy  and the inside of the quiche is different from a lot of other quiches i've had.  Other places make the egg overcooked and the crust dry, and either too salty or not salty enough.  Bouchon 's quiche is just perfect and delictable!  the inside is not to firm and has the consistency of a flan.   the only negative thing i have about this is that they dont give you enough.  the slice is pretty small and the mixed baby greens they give you on the side is so pitiful!  But... thats okay. im still willing to eat you up my yummy quiche!  \n     i also really love their corned beef hash! its actually real cubed corn beef hash and potatoes...  you may be used to eating the mushy corn beef with oil oozing out from all over! yuck!  Bouchon does it best!\n     Their croque mademoiselle is probably a 3.5-4*.  I didn't think it was that great. The flavor combination wasn't anything new.  It looks really good, but didn't wow my tastebuds.  However...My friend ordered the special of the day: steak and eggs.  so cliche for brunch but...omg it was delicious! it came with caramelized onions and herbed potatoes in a cast iron skillet... the steak was cooked just right and was very flavorful, but still had the meatiness to it! \n    The environment is really nice.  its an open French restaurant nestled in the back of Venetian and away from the hustle and bustle of the loud casino atmosphere.  It has a gorgeous garden pool view and large windows that let in the bright desert sun! love it! \n\n\n\nEDIT** THEY ARE OPENING ONE IN BEV HILLS! WOOOOOT!"
0,Rice tasted like plastic. Service sucked. It was my first and last time going there. If I didn't have a $20 gift card I don't think I would went in the first place. Not a good experience at all. :(
0,"When they mean sugar and ice they are not kidding! In preparation for my upcoming Vegas trip, I thought it was time for me to catch up on my Vegas reviews since I am looking for advice on where to go as well.  \n\nAvoid this place! Tourist trap...sure it may LOOK pretty and enticing but it is fail! This is not gelato... I have been all over Europe last year ...11 countries... and this place is a joke and the price is pretty high\n\nMy new goal of late is to try as many new places as possible and to let people know what to expect.  The reviews were deceiving and I was expecting some delicious gelato but found myself standing there with 2 scoops and a chocolate waffle cone for $10 are you kidding me! For that price I could get 10 Virgin Pina Coladas in any hotel just by tipping the server.  The cone was too sugary.  Their chocolate coating didn't even taste like real chocolate but waxy sweetness that was not worth the money or calories.  I have yet to find a good gelato place in Vegas.  Don't fall for the pretty cases! lol"
1,"Upon walking in I was excited. Just like a kid in a candy store. Displays of delicious treats lined up and frosted to perfection is my idea of a good time. I tend to go crazy in bakeries like this and buy a little more than I need but it was worth it. The customer service here is amazing, they answered numerous questions from my friend and I about their products and seemed eager to please. I typically don't tip those in a bakery but the woman who helped us deserved it. She went above and beyond the call of duty and really helped us find what we were looking for. \nI will be back!"
1,"Best East Coast pizza this side of the Mississippi! Even though our order is a tad complicated, they always get it right. We appreciate that they have Raspberry Cider and the garlic knots are an excellent excuse for warding off unwanted male suitors."
1,I had a great lunch experience .  Professional service. Food was absolutely amazing.\nI am giving 5 stars for the pricing . \nI couldn't believe it you still can get something so delicious with a high class    under 10 dollars .\nThank you.\n(I have submitted to pictures of Slow Raoasted Beef Brisket and Sea Scallops )
1,"For being on the strip, this place is cheap! Especially for the quality of food they have.\n\nThe Full Montagu: Good. A little heavy on the mustard sauce, but tasty nonetheless.\nThe Scudetto: My fave so far.\n\nI wouldn't go to Vegas just for a sandwich, but if I'm ever in the area, or if I'm by the one in Socal, I'll probably have to drop by and try their other sandwiches."
1,This was my first time to ever dine in the restaurant I live in there delivery area so I normally just order for delivery as always I was very pleased with their food their shredded beef and Chicken is delicious first time to try their chili Riano nice large chili great filling and very good sauce the Salsa bar is a nice touch
0,The worst service I have ever had in my life. You need different servers that actually care about your customers. I will not ever be coming back to this bar.
0,"I've been to this restaurant over the years.  Back in the days, it was rated as the best mexican (tex-mex) restaurant in all of montreal.\nToday - I dont know what happened, but it was no where close to what it was like years ago.  The menu might be the same, but the food was just wrong.\n\nOrdered:\n1. Cactus App - Was soggy, and out of a can..  I didnt even know that Cactus came in a can!!.  I've had it before at other restaurants, fresh, but why???  Why do you have to make it taste like the brine in a can?\n\n2. Pasta with Avacado - Soggy pasta, lots of water on the plate, not tasty sauce, and the only good fresh thing in the meal was the actual avocado.\n\nI do hope and pray that you guys really change your menu, reduce the number of items, and specialize in a smaller number of dishes.. So that your food tastes a lot better in the future."
1,"This gym is amazing. The workouts focus on High Intensity Interval Training, which is designed to give you the maximum calorie burn. Each work out is different and they are never boring. (They are also never easy!) I have been a member for almost a year and every workout comes with variations. There are modifications for easier and more difficult moves. When my lower back bothers me, I have always been given another modification or another exercise. But what really sets this place apart are the people. Both the trainers and the clients here are great. Everyone works together to motivate each other. If I miss a class I usually attend, people notice! There are family workouts on Sundays, and they often have events ranging from kickball to running club. They encourage the whole family to be active together."
0,"Stayed at MGM grand for two nights during a business trip this week, and I'm glad I know never to stay at this hotel again.  There was nothing but mishaps and poor service all around.\n\nI checked in around 6pm and was told they had given away the Bungalow Suite I reserved (although I wonder if this is true now that I read some of the other reviews here?) and instead of offering an upgrade they decided to downgrade me instead to a standard room (and it wasn't just me, at least 2 other people had the same problem; front desk said they oversold for Valentines day...why is it so hard to only sell the amount of suites they actually have?).  To make matters worse they didn't even offer me anything to make up the difference (the suite I paid for was $20 more than a standard room), so I had to ask if I would be refunded the difference and the front desk said \""well you already have the $65 dining credit\"" ....which was part of their current promo that everyone gets, whether they purchase a suite or not.  They did eventually offer to waive my resort fees and they gave me a mini fridge for free as well (which was old and came on this ugly cart, it was such an eye sore), but the fact that they didn't offer it up front shows how little they value their customers.\n\nThe room was newly renovated and I did like the decor and colors in the room; they at least attempted to make it look a bit more \""swanky\"" than your average hotel decor. But when I go there was no remote for the TV, so they brought one up and that didn't work, so they brought up another one and that one didn't work either...and it turned out that the TV just didn't work at all, even though it was a brand new flat screen (the rooms were only renovated 3 weeks ago).  They said 3 other TVs had done the same that day offered to send up an engineer, but it was almost 9:00 and my show was ending anyways, so I didn't want someone in my room that late.\n\nThe second day of my stay I was set to move to the suite I paid for, they told me it would be ready between 11 and 3, which of course turned into a \""wait until 3\"".  So I wait until 3, go to the front desk to get my key, they already KNOW that I've left my things in the room and will be moving them over, so what do they do?  They lock the room.  So I call security (twice) and it takes them 20ish minutes to come up and unlock the room for me so I can get my stuff out.\n\nAnd there was no apology from security, or anyone else that I spoke with except the guy at the front desk when  I checked out.  In general, most of the staff I spoke with on the phone (security, operator, in room dining, etc) had bad attitudes and just sounded bored.\n\nThe suite was nice enough, it didn't have a kitchenette unfortunately, and the decor was blah (it didn't even have a flat screen tv), but at least it was spacious and came with a robe and slippers.  \n\nThings I did like -- the easy access to the monorail and the food court.  Their rates are great too; but it's not worth the hassle."
1,"I'm at an Officemax at least twice a month.  I even have a couple near my home but find myself driving an extra mile or two to come here.  Why?? Well, it's the combination between their customer service, full service printing, and because it's located next to a Barnes & Nobles.  \n\nMain reason I hit up an Officemax is to have copies made.  I rather not spend the next 15+ minutes doing it myself, so I get the full service.  Price to get this done is far cheaper for me here than a FedEx, Office Depot, or Staples.  Besides, at this location I can drop off my originals, give them my request (i.e. hole punched paper, stapled, binded, etc), then head next door to the Barnes & Noble.  \n\nThe service at the actual store is pretty good too.  There's always an associate that greets you in and out.  Some of the best customer service.  I usually have a list and they have no problems directing me to each item.  \n\nBottom line, I prefer this Officemax over others just out of pure convenience.  Easy parking because it's usually empty, near a freeway, close to a Starbucks, close to a book store, and super service."
0,"Ok so update.... Last time we where here we had table reservations. Had the table reservations confirmed with a special request for a particular table on the dance floor. Where told it shouldn't be a problem and then showed up there only to find out that (1) they were OVERBOOKED with table reservations and (2) we DEFINITELY would not be getting the table we had asked for.  Granted we had connections and where getting buy one get ones for the bottles but they initally had to  sit us in the stupid room thats right at the front entrance of the club until something else opened up. NO THANKYOU. We thankfully met these people who understood our situation and where kind enough to invite us and our bottles to there table by the dance floor.  Had a pretty decent time but the security guard who was watching the table was a complete DICK. He tried to kick my friend out repeatedly and did a HORRIBLE job of keeping this one drunk bitch out who was stalking my friend. No joke... she was hiding behind the wall until he wasnt looking and tried to sneak back in!!! Anyways, I feel that the Bank could have definitely handled things better and unfortunatly I highly doubt I will be back.... Definitely never again for bottle service."
0,It's interested concept but the sushi is not great at all. Most of them has crab mix. A lot of fried and I think they place coloring die on the fish. I will not go back here
0,"Visited during lunch, so so meal. Chickrn was alittle dry but fresh veggies/rice was perfect. Annoyed with bird flying around inside restaurant as you ate. Please remove has to be sanitary issue."
1,"This is my first time using vape. PSV showed me how to use the products and let me taste majority of the flavor. I bought the voltage tube mod with adjustable volatage, battery, charger, 6ml tank, and the 6 bottle sample set. They also upgraded my cartomizer for free so I dont burn it out. All of this with tax came out to $149. Very great price! They showed me how everything works and are very friendly when doing so. The place is a little far but well worth it. I would say to bring cash if you spend over $50 because you get a free 6ml bottle of your choice. I only tried rip tide so far and it taste amazing. I will be going here from now on for flavors and accessories."
1,"I had a wonderful experience here. Came in for a late breakfast, ordered the breakfast burrito, nothing complicated, but wonderful food. The owners are so kind and the chef/owner is there because of his love of the culinary arts and passion for the joie de vivre that comes with the food culture and the camaraderie. That's what makes all the difference :) go support this wonderful local business!"
0,"I joined Costco in San Jose, CA and liked it there.  In Las Vegas my experience has been awful.  The employees are rude and can get you killed.  http://www.lvrj.com/news/erik-scott-s-family-files-wrongful-death-suit-against-costco-158268755.html?login=y\n\nThey sell off brand products that are adulterated.  Try the Crockett Honey in the large size.  When I first bought it was good quality.  Then I went back for seconds.  The stuff is now adulterated with some sort of dark molasses or high fructose corn syrup.  You can taste it.  I buy my honey at Walmart now based on quality.  Today there was no Yuban coffee.  WTF?  \n\nI liked Costco because they sold quality products in bulk at a decent price.  I bet they also use pink slime in their ground beef.  I can buy gas cheaper if I shop a little or use a gas app.  Walmart gives me easier to manage quantities at the same or better pricing.  Between Walmart and the weekly grocery ads I have not been to Costco in 6 months.  Today I reaffirmed why."
1,The gambler's special is a great deal. The steak & shrimp was one of my favorite meals on our trip as they were both cooked perfectly. Every time I go it's always consistent.
0,"Overcrowded and not even last years styles, more like styles from 2-3 years ago. Every purse here was really basic and not appealing. For me that is. I guess if you like simple and plain coach bags, this might be the place for you. Yes the prices are lower than the actual coach stores, however, they are still 100.00 to 200.00 per purse depending on what you choose. To me, that is not a big enough discount to warrant buying such boring purses. I guess you can call me cheap but I would rather pay less and have a stylish purse that might fall apart within a year or pay about a hundred dollars more (300.00) and go to a normal coach store and get a purse I love that apparently also is of a better quality. Not only that, this outlet store doesnt have nearly enough employees for the amount of people that visit here. If I had even had a question, there is no way I would have had it answered. It was weird because at the Coach store at Ceasars, the sales girl was a little too attentive and came off as fake. Yet, at the outlet store, the sale people could have cared less and seemed almost rude probably from being overworked and stressed out. Honestly, I was initially excited to visit here but walked out disappointed. This outlet store was not only an unpleasant shopping experience but it also didnt seem like a real great deal price wise to me. Yes, I cringe thinking about spending 300.00 at a real Coach store, however, it seems a little more worth it then still paying alot and buying something that I am really not that happy with at the Outlet all for the sake of having a Coach purse."
1,"A shoe lover's paradise! I cannot believe the amount of shoes they have here, even sneakers.  In some sizes the sneakers had to be stacked on top of each other!  Lots of boots on clearance since the summer is coming.  I liked the setup of the store and that there weren't many people there.  I didn't get a chance to look at the clothes because I was there strictly for shoes, but I'll definitely be back!"
1,"Generally when I'm craving BBQ I think of Toms right away- always been a fave of mine. I had the pulled pork sandwich, which comes topped with a bit of their house coleslaw; I'm not a fan of coleslaw whatsoever but makes a good touch to the sandwich. \n\nLike Amy said below they have big bottles of their sauce (mild and hot), at the table and tend to get a lil happy with the hot bbq sauce, I have problem lol. Also keep in mind the curly fries are meant to be shared they are a HUGE order but sooo good."
0,"Mixed review, it's ok, I go here...sometimes. Good selection of drat, their own brew and guest taps. I like to drink local and spend my dime on local wares whenever possible. Having said that, last time I was here the place was nasty smoky. Yes, nasty.\n\nIt was a Sunday and the football crowd was still here after the packers game, rooting, gaming, definitely smoking up a storm and drinking their bud. Don't even get me started on going to a brewery and ordering a bud bottle. That might just be the definition of insanity. Anyway, maybe it wasn't the best time for a nonsmoking, beer enthusiast to patronize this establishment. I take some of the blame, but I looked around this bar and I was not part of the majority demographic monopolizing the polluted air space. \n\nI'm much better served coming here in the warmer months. Sitting outside, away from the smoke, maybe bring my dogs along, which are more than welcome. Or earlier in the day, through the week even. But the weekend, during American \""football\"", watching people swill their bud, puff their stinking cigs, all while filling their faces with fatty bar food. No thanks."
1,ONLY FOR THEIR TAKEOUT BREAKFAST:\n\nbest potatoes ever.  yum.
1,"Had dinner there last night.   Fantastic service, so prompt, sincere and personable.  The food was delish.  I had the chicken pesto pasta...yumm.\nLove the interior design...very cool.\n\nHad a live guitarist/vocalist and bassist who were fantastic but just a smidge too loud....was little hard to have a conversation with four of us across the table."
1,"This review is for the nightclub. Came here on a Sunday night for the open bar. It went from 11pm-12, and we met up with our promoter outside the club. There was quite a line outside, but he was able to walk our group of girls in for free. There aren't many clubs open on Sundays in Vegas so LAVO was great for pre-party.\n\nThe club is upstairs and really pretty. The walkway is lined with these water fountain-like things, very classy and chic. Having only gone to Surrender at the time, LAVO seemed amazing and very well-decorated. \n\nCompared to other clubs like XS, LAVO is a bit small, especially the dance floor. It was already packed before 12am. I enjoyed the music though, and the crowd seemed a little younger. The drinks from open bar were pretty watery, but the cocktail waitresses were really hot. \n\nBottom line: come here for the open bar. Maybe dance a little."
0,"I hate to do this, but this is the 2nd time I have ordered online, and almost an hour later they called and told me they 'just saw my faxed in order'  Uhm, sorry, I placed it online on YOUR WEBSITE.  If you can't accept/handle online orders that's fine, but don't pretend you can.  The first time they never 'saw' my order, and when I called in an hour later they told me they couldn't reverse the charges on my card.  So I had to get the Pita's still delivered, even though by the time we got them it was 2 hours after we initially ordered.  The delivery guy let it slip that they never put paper in their printer, so no online orders could print.  That's just crazy.  Also, the Pitas aren't as good as the old University location.  Sad, I guess no more Pita's for our office...  :-("
0,"I was there because the bouncer from Tao gave me & my girls VIP tickets with complementary drinks so it's like why not, lets go check it out. The place is pretty small, & crowded, The crowd mostly 30+ we were there for less than an hour and left. I just wasn't having fun there. =("
0,"Like other reviewers, I really wanted to like Rusconi's. The chef/owner is makes an effort to greet customers. The same can't be said, however, about some of his staff. My husband and I tried the restaurant on several occasions. We want a non-chain restaurant to succeed in this location. We've experienced lapses in service and the food has been unmemorable. A particular visit particularly stands out. We brought our family to Rusconi's for lunch. The bartender acted very disinterested. We sat for 15 minutes without being offered water or drinks. When he did bring our food order, the food must have been sitting for awhile. The fries with the burgers were cold, the bartender/waiter had mixed up two of the orders, and then there was the posole. The posole resembled dirty dishwater. There was literally one piece of posole floating in the broth. When we asked our waiter to split the checks, he sighed and said it was a \""big deal\"" for him to do so. Needless to say, we won't be back nor will any members of our party."
0,Don't use these guys unless you make an appointment with the dispatcher.   Made arrangements with two different drivers and both times I was stood up.\nWould never use them again.
0,March 19 around 9pm...My friend also wrote his review here but i would like to add more.\nWe just ordered SALAD and Sandwich....waiter (Bold guy with beard) never came to us with any updates and we have been waiting for 40 min...are you serious??? \nI went and complain to manager he was very nice to us. I told him that we are not willing to wait more and we are leaving...\nNot going there again!!! \nAwful place!!!
1,"Really glad that me and my best friend decided to visit the garage, we were iffy at first before visiting because were tourists from DC, but Danny & Gabriel were very open and welcoming, its a great place, had a great time. \n\nWe're definitely visiting next time we visit. #werq"
0,"Hit or miss at best.  Last night when I called a male answered the phone and was anything but willing to take my order.  They have delivered to my area several times before but not last night, all sorts of creative excuses came up.  \n\nTHE RUDE EMPLOYEE FROM LAST NIGHT SHOULD BE FIRED!  \n\nNot sure WHO the manager is, but if your employees are making business decisions for you, thats not the kind of place I am going to engage with any further.\n\nGuess what, you just lost a customer who was ordering weekly and giving a generous tip to your driver each time.  \n\nMy recommendation to everyone, STAY AWAY!!!"
0,Extremely rude coworkers!! Prices are overly too much! They don't accept cash AND you have to buy tartar sauce too ? Are you kiddn me? Never AGAIN coming back!!
0,"I'm upset that I have to give this business even 1 star. My bf and I had gone to eat arepas and seeing that this was the first time we ever saw this store open, decided to stop in. At first, the owner/mgr lady was great... friendly and helpful. Then, when I decided to make a purchase (of an item I'm sure I could find much cheaper online), things went south. \n\nI purchased a yelp deal of 50 for 75 and the owner refused to honor it. She kept saying that yelp did not have a connection with her bank account and that yelp doesn't charge me- that my credit card information is only taken so that a redemption code is provided to me so I can receive the deal. Mind you, I've purchased yelp deals before and my card has MOST DEFINITELY been charged. I called my credit card company and had them verbally tell her that it was a purchase I already made and that my card was being charged by yelp. However, because the charge was in a pending status she still kept arguing that I was not being charged and that she would give me the 50 for 75 deal but I would have to pay the 50 to her, when I had already paid it to Yelp.\n\nAlso, throughout the whole time she kept pushing that I had to write a review to get any deal. Needless to say, I will not be purchasing anything from this business now or ever again and have already contacted yelp about her refusal to honor the deal and getting my money back. I will give her one thing though, she got her review."
1,"I love the Wings Over chain. As a PSU alum, I frequently order from Wings Over in State College and would still order from there when visiting as a treat. Opening a location again in Pittsburgh made my day. They offer in bone and boneless wings, fries and ribs. All are amazing. I usually get the Hanger 1, which is a pound of boneless wings with 2 flavors, fries and a drink. They have a large selection of flavors, both sauces and dry rubs. Even though they don't deliver to my apartment, I'm willing to drive over and pick it up. It can also be a little expensive, but the wings are worth it."
0,"I had the worst experience ever at this place!!!!!\nService was horrible and the food was not great to make up for it either.\nI heard soooooo much about bubba gump shrimp and was always really excited to try it, and finally a group of friends and I did. Sadly the server we had was AWFUL!!!!!!!!! I had never in my life seen anyone hate his \""life/job\"" more than our server, he was talking to us like we were \""annoying him\"" for just being there it was ridicules. He would cut us off in the middle of ordering, and talk to the other waiters around him, and when we asked for recommendations he just simply told us \""that it all depends on what you like\"" in the tone of voice saying (just pick darn it!). \nThe food was not great and the portions were SMALLER than expected but the service did not help, it made us just want to get out of there, without even getting a dessert (this pretty much never happens in my book so its serious! lol) \nand when we finally got the bill he asked us to pick up everything off the table put it in the plates and pick it up and hand it to him, (if you ask me, he pretty much made us clear our own table for him! lol and we tipped him after! haha)\noverall horrible experience but gave for conversation at dinner and after! lol"

0,"So, my client in Montreal decided to take a New Yorker to a place called \""Madison's NY Bar & Grill\"". I knew from the beginning that this wasn't going to be a 5 Yelp experience, and it wasn't. I'll keep this one brief:\n\nRestaurant:\n+ & - It's a chain, I loathe chain restaurants but it was large, clean and the staff was friendly.\n\nService:\n+ We had a really quirky waiter whom at first, confused us if he was a man or a woman. His wack-a-doodle hairstyle, his feminine ways of speaking and conducting business had us quite confused...however upon further visual inspection of his chest area, led us to believe he was a male. With that said, he was still a fairly efficient waiter handling our party of 10\n\nFood:\n- I stuck with a grilled chicken salad as everything else on the menu seemed unappealing to this New Yorker. It's not any different than any other chain restaurant and the calorie counts on the dishes they're serving are quite high\n\nOverall, this seems to be a very popular spot for the local professionals and gets quite busy during the lunch hour but I don't think it's worth a re-visit upon my next trip to the beautiful city of Montreal.\n\nTHIS has been a review by Gaurav"
1,"Went to Sticky fingers and had wings. they were 10x better than the Quaker Lube down the street. Ate at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and the bar/eating area was exceptionally clean. If I am back in town and looking for some great wings, great service and a clean restaurant- then I will be here."
1,I meant to leave a review the last time I ate here this place is truly AWESOME!!! I had a great experience and the food I ate was tasty and there was a great variety. Best Buffett I have eaten at in a long time. Highly recommend!!!
0,"Cold French Toast. When mentioned to the waitress she brought back to the kitchen. She came back to tell me that the kitchen was making me a new batch. She came back with the new batch which had the same corner removed that I cut originally to find out that the toast was cold. Ok, it did come back hot (for at least 5 minutes). Toast was dry and tasteless. My daughter who is a IHOP aficionado told me that the French Toast at the IHOP in San Jose, CA is better, but believe me I am not running to find out."
0,"Although I also REALLY enjoy Mi Familia (just down the road, literally), I really hope BOTH restaurants succeed. This Roberto's have a drive thru and is open 24hrs which is always nice when looking for something at any hour.\n\nService here was good, food was yummy as always!\nRestaurant was clean inside and out (always a big deal for me, after all-they ARE preparing our food) \n\nThe only reason it is 3 stars and not 4 is their phone service: i've called 3 different times now (we've been eating out a lot lately) and one time the phone was answered in Spanish, so I hung up. The next time was ok and the last (3rd) time was 'Hello?'-phone skills are every bit as important as anything else. If you're rude to me (as they were) then i'm going to go somewhere else (as i said, Mi Familia is just down the road). Please, Thank You, You're Welcome: theseshould be standard on every phone call. \n\nDon't act like i'm inconveniencing you when ordering...\n\nUpdate (down grade from 3 stars): I went to pickup my order (\""Ready in 10 minutes\"", then she hung up) 15 minutes later and it wasn't even started. Today my neighbor and I both have food poisoning-stay away from the chicken AND do yourself a favor- go down the road to Mi Familia. Nicer people, family owned, and quality food."
0,"1st trip about 2 months ago was pretty good.  Was there again today and service was poor.  Ordered eggs over medium, were served like they were hockey pucks...told the waitress and she said she would get new eggs for us, but left the our plates on the table for the next 10 minutes letting the ham, hash browns and English muffins get cold.  Why would they NOT put the plates back under the warmer in the kitchen until the eggs were ready?  Manager came over and said she understood the eggs were made incorrectly, I asked her why they would leave our plates on the table...she said 'sorry' and that was it.  Did not offer to offset the bill, nothing, nada, zippo - so I just had to limit my tip and left a note on the receipt saying \""Cold food today - not good\"".\n\nHow do you screw up eggs?  Ask US Egg....very disappointing."
1,"Sauce is absolutely packed at lunch time as it is one of the few spots to eat around the S Dobson/Ocotillo area. You pay at the counter and have your food delivered to your table. The line to order/pay at the counter are usually long and take a while to get to. The menu items themselves look really tasty and partially healthy. However, I found Sauce to really be overpriced for the actual quality and size of what you are getting. They try to be high-end but the food does not support it. I have had better pizzas and better salads for way less, I don't think it warrants $8-12 for lunch."
0,Ok.  I try this place 2 or 3 times a year praying it will get better.   I live i n the lake and its the only place to go if your out for a boat ride.  Without fail its always the same.   Dirty.... I'm looking at a spider web hanging from a moose head as I write this.   Sloooow service.   Poor to standard food.  If it wasn't for the monopoly of being on the lake they would be out of business.
0,I avoid this Taco Bell and make the drive 5 miles to the one on McDowell. This place sucks.  WORST SERVICE EVER. Can't get an order right.
0,We came here while staying at the Cheaparral next door and the enchiladas were ok good but not while eatting the first one and there was a piece of hair chilling on top of the tortilla. Eww gross can you afford hair nets? The margarita was full of ice and sweet sour mix gross mama mia are you serious? Selling me a glass of sweet sour for $10.00 wow how tacky. The service was horrendous the waitress was a real ditzy broad who was more worried about what was going on after work then her own 2tables. I suggest go to another restaurant down the street instead of here.
1,"How can you go wrong with a place that sells everything from hardwood flooring to couches, golf clubs to punch bowl sets?\n\nHabitat ReStore is a part of a nationwide effort of Habitat for Humanity.  They use items donated to them that can't be used in houses and sell them to raise additional funds for the organization.\n\nSince inventory is donation based, it changed constantly, but there is a huge variety of items, most in very good (some even new) condition.\n\nThey take charges, but there is a $10 minimum (no minimum for debit purchases).\n\nThis store is especially great for people completing do it yourself home repairs or those furnishing their first house or apartment.\n\nI was there to volunteer but ended up making a purchase.  I know I'll be back (both to volunteer and shop)"
1,"First things first, The name of this place is Chef Guru G and not Chef Guru. It resembles a hole in the wall. This place doesn't even try to look fancy. I'd heard people raving about their curry poutine, So I wanted to try it out. There were around 6 people in this restaurant  havin the same thing. The CURRY POUTINE. It was spicy and delicious. A perfect amalgamation of  Quebecois & Pakistani cuisine.  So far one of the best poutine variations I've tried in the city. They take a while to prepare it. It gives me hope (or false hope) that they make it fresh.\n\nFood : Great\nService :Friendly / Slow\nAmbiance : Hole in the wall\nWorth the price : Yes"
1,"I've had lunch here a couple of times and have liked what I've had to eat. They have a good grilled cheese and chili special but will let you know that the grilled cheese was probably made with American cheese singles, which was ok because it made dunking the sandwich into the chili easier. I've also had their French dip sandwich with fries which wasn't that bad. Worth checking out."
1,"Came here as a party of 4 on Christmas Eve - we had a reservation, but the place was jammed packed so I was unsure of the wait, despite having a reservation. We checked in and were taken immediately to a table. Our server was excellent, we never had an empty class. The food was wonderful, not a long wait for it to come out and just an overall great experience. 5 stars for excellent customer service and tasty food!"
1,Eest Asian Bistro is the best Asia food I have had in Arizona.  Food and service are very good.
1,"Like many have stated, Chen's serves Americanized Chinese food. That isn't to suggest that it isn't good. In fact, it quite good. We were promptly seated and given menus. \n\nThe establishment is well kept and not too noisy. Friendly service of the mom and pop shop gives the place a comfortable feel. Appetizer soups came out only a minute after ordering, and by the time we finished our cups of soup, our HOT meals were on the table!\n\nThe pan fried noodles were a little on the salty side, but tasted really good. The beef with snow peas was really good, especially after adding some chili sauce (which I asked for separately). Portion sizes definitely worth the money, and it's relatively inexpensive anyways. \n\nI would eat here over Panda Express any day! Better taste, waiter service, quieter and the personal touch of the owners running their business. Thank you!"
1,"Old Vegas has always been appealing to me. The Strip is fun, but I love the mid-century aesthetic that makes up old Vegas. Frankie's Tiki Room is one of those places that epitomize the old school feel. On a recent trip to Vegas, we rolled into Frankie's late night. The place was quiet and the drinks included large amounts of rum, fruit and umbrellas. \n\nTiki themed with fun drinks and a vibe that probably hasn't changed much since it opened make Frankie's a great spot. It feels like tiki bars are a dying breed, making Frankie's very special."
1,"Wonderful tea, comfy seating, and great food!\n\nFOOD\nThis was my first fully vegan restaurant experience. It was wonderful!!\nI always wondered what a BLT without real \""B\"" tastes like. I must say it was the best BLT I've ever had, including those with bacon. I don't know how they did it! The strawberry smooth was also divine.\n\nENVIRONMENT\nThe ambiance/atmosphere has a very modern, new age feel. The main dining room isn't huge but the seating included  tables and some long couch-like benches- great for my daughter to stretch out on when she was done eating. The front of the restaurant is completely open allowing for an open air atmosphere- very nice!\n\nOTHER\nBig parties may want to call ahead. And sadly, they are only open unitl 6pm on Sundays... \nThey were very accomodating to my daughter's peanut allergy and they washed all containers for food prep just for her.\n\nHighly recommended even if you aren't vegan!"
1,"The decor is classic dark brew pub. It works. A nice place to hang with your friends or just chill by yourself.\n\nAn above average pub menu. The breakfast menu is pretty good, with lots of choices. We like it - my sweetie loves to come here.\n\nToday we showed up a bit late for breakfast, so we fastened onto the lunch menu. Again,  lots of choices. I went with the \""round mountain\"" roast beef sandwich,  my sweetie went with the Paradise Carnita sandwich. We both had the home made chips,,, my sandwich was okay -- it was as advertised -- but it was kinda bland for my taste. Not Steiner 's fault,  the roast beef sandwich would be killer for someone with a blander palette than mine.  The Paradise Carnita sandwich was absolutely KILLER.\nSo full of flavor -- an awesome choice,  sweetie loved it as did I.  I know what Im ordering on my next visit.  Pulled pork ( carnita style )  with spicy sauce and pico de gallo served on a sweet sourdough roll. Amazing sandwich.\n\nGood selection of beers - on tap and in bottles. Service was good,  and the prices are fair. Recommended."
1,"This museum is a BLAST!\n\nIt's THE BOMB!\n\nOkay, how can this place have 19 reviews and I am the first one to use those lame puns?\n\nSeriously, though, if you are a history nut, you will enjoy this place.  It has quite a bit of interesting artifacts and information.  I especially liked the Ground Zero Theater, which has some nifty Sensurround-like effects.  Locals get a discount, and they didn't ask us for any proof, so it probably wouldn't hurt to ask for the local admission rate, even if you are visiting."
0,"Mezzo was amazing before Chef Alfredo left.  The food was AMAZING and the service was better than that. Each time we'd visit, Alfredo would pay a visit to our table to welcome us, and willingly prepare off the menu delights. Those days are gone. And the food has deteriorated. What a shame. We miss you. Alfredo! We've followed Chef Marc to Parma."
1,"Happened upon Saffron and was really impressed! \nThe appetizer sampler and chutneys were spicy and delicious, the service was excellent, and  it was a perfect meal from start to finish.\nI had a spicy chicken biryani and my date chose  channa masala (vegan), and we were both raving. Finished up with a warm dessert that was like donut balls in a honey syrup.\nNeither of us live in Charlotte, but if we did, we'd be regulars. Wonderful dining experience!"
1,"I am all about sandwiches today.\n\nThe Goodwich is located just outside of Dino's Lounge, and the food there is just another example of \""Sandwich Joy\"", a rare place to visit, but the reception is wonderful.\n\nThe Missus and I went there for an afternoon outing, and while I can't remember what she got, the pate sandwich that I discovered was so rich and flavorful....  It was beyond good.\n\nBest of all, Dino's allows people to sit at their bar and eat, so I brought in my food, ordered a beer, and just spent a blissful moment munching contentedly at this latest of finds.  Again, for what you get, the value is excellent.\n\nI've become convinced that Vegas might be one of the \""Great Sandwich Capitals of America\"".  There are enough excellent sandwich places here to placate all of my \""various foodstuffs between two pieces of bread\"" needs.\n\nTruly and highly recommended.  I wish this little business all the best of luck, because they have earned it.  And my repeat business."
1,"Not Bad sushi...very cool decor, a little too air conditioned...Definately a young good looking college crowd...and then us late 20 and 30 somethings..\n\nA group of 12 of us went in tonight, a Tuesday, (we are all out of towners just here for work) and we got a table and served relatively quickly. \n\nWe ordered the Tuna Tar Tar, Spicy Tuna Roll, Rainbow Roll and some Nigiri...all I like is the Maguro combo's and they were great, nothing special, but tasty. At the other end of the table they got these deep fried rolls with cream cheese and all that I don't consider real sushi, they were probably good but I didn't try them.\n\nThe prices are ok, the 3 of us with all our sushi and $3.25 Miso soups and a few beers was only $77, maybe I'm just used to paying more in the San Fran area that I live... \n\nThe best part was the T-shirts all the waitresses wear..they say\n\n\""Will you still _____ me in the morning.\"" ....I guess you fill in the blank."
0,"This is a beautiful property in a great location but the service level is below what I usually get at a Hampton Inn.  Long check in lines and very slow responses to requests.  We are in a wrap around suite with the \""beck and call\"" button on the phone.  Called for hangers for clothing, only a few provided, then had to call again 2 hours later.  Called for an extra blanket, hour later asked the housekeeper for a blanket, then at 11:45 PM, aft converting bath robes into a blanket for my son, someone shows up with a blanket.  Called at 9:00 AM next day for something, called again at 5:00 PM to follow up and they had no record of my first request.  The suite has a washer and dryer, but no laundry soap.  Also has a kitchen, but no glasses or eating utensils provided.   An awesome property falling down on execution of the basics.\n\nAn update, the manager made a personal call to apologize and the quality of housekeeping improved greatly after that.  I appreciate the effort very much."
1,"How have I never visited this chocolate factory heaven until now?  I want to kick myself for all of the years I wasted shopping at Caesar's Palace and missing the opportunity to eat, indulge, and drink at Max Brenner's.  My husband and I needed to rest our feet and take a snack break when the word's \""A Chocolate Love Story\"" caught my eye at the storefront.  When we sat down and browsed the decadent sweets menu, I felt like I struck \""the golden ticket\"" of dessert shops and cafes.  From hot chocolates to ice cream to cakes, I wanted to try everything.  However, we restrained our sugar cravings (and wallet... as its not the cheapest cocoa on the block) and shared a \""Fantastic Vanilla Ice Cream Cone and Chocolate Fondue\"" and a warm mocha.  The \""Fantastic\"" was essentially a little mini-bar of chocolate wafer balls, rich milk chocolate fondue, and toasted candied hazelnut bits to top the vanilla ice cream cone.  Heaven on a cone.  My mocha was also rich and delicious, and since it also comes with chocolate cream, no extra sugar was required.  The drink comes in a cute pear shaped \""Hug Mug\"", which allows you to hug your drink close with both hands for optimal sipping.  How sweet is that?  Max Brenner, you've definitely captured my heart with your chocolate love story."
0,"Terrible.\n\nThe only flavor these pizzas have is salt.  That's it.  The presentation is very pretty, some one certainly cares about the product they are putting out, and its presentation.  The service is timely and polite.\n\nThere is not other way to put it, the pizza is among the worst I ever had.  Very salty- no depth of flavor, truthfully, I have had better pizza from the grocery store freezer."
1,"Umami always delivers when I am hankering for some solid food.  My go to dishes are usually the pork burns along with the chicken and shrimp dumplings.  I feel the pork buns are some of the best in town.  The fattyness of the pork offset by the sliced cucumbers and hoisin sauce make it incredibly addicting.  This time, my girlfriend and I also went with the tuna poke.  Served with some variation of a chip, the tuna was fresh and evenly sauced with soy and sesame oil.  While I still feel the pork buns ruled the night, the poke was a nice change of pace.  Umami also is one of the few places that serves up Hitachino beer (little owl) so that is always a plus."
0,"Hi \nI'm sorry to say that i had a awful experience with them. I asked to write something on the birthday cake of my friend who has bad cancer who can go anytime.  One of my friend picked up the cake for him. I expected a better customer service  since I have been a loyal client for more than 6 years. I told my dying friend how good is going to be his birthday cake. When i opened the box it wasn't how i asked. Very disappointing!  We were sad, bcz the cake was the main thing. So i complined to the woner Billy to learn how much he didn't value my loyalty. He said  he will not replace the cake,said \""did we ruined ur day that much?\"" So before i flash them out of life i call them back  one more time, nothing changed. This is how much i was dissatisfied with the service. I would expect little better for my $$ n loyalty, time. \n\nSo don't ruined ur birthday like me, i do not recommend them. They lost me. In any other party  If i encounter cake coming from them i scape dessert. Bcz I wasn't valued as a long-term client  t. tnx"
1,"I love cities with public transportation, and I particularly love cities with subways since that means I won't have to drive to get around.  Montreal is the city with the cleanest subway I've seen of late although Toronto probably beats it hands down (I just haven't been to Toronto in the last 8 years).  Montreal's subway cars are clean and well-kept, they run on time, there is never a long wait, and I don't feel unsafe traveling the subway after dark.\n\nThe service to the metro area is well-planned and I can get from one end of the city to the other in under an hour (and more likely under 30 minutes)  including the walk to the destination.  In a city of 4 million people that is as spread out as Montreal, this is key.  The best thing I like about it?  I see locals using it ALL THE TIME, so it's not just for tourists.\n\nThe only issues I have with Montreal's Metro?  There are very few stops outside of the island of Montreal, meaning that there are places I can't see and things I can't do because the Metro doesn't run there. But I'll suck it up and deal with my disappointment, because Montreal's Metro is, hands down, the most well planned and executed subway I've traveled in a long time."
0,Not pleased with this branch at all. :/ I see no logic in telling me I can't use checks I am cashing to get a cashiers check when I am an account holder.  BUT..... I can cash those checks come back and they would issue me one? Fucking stupid! !!!! How is that logical? All they did is piss me off to the point I won't come to this branch.  I seriously want to walk back in and get a money order with the teller right next to the other guy.  Grrrrrrrrrr.
0,"Before I even start, I want to make note that this is the very first physical therapy session I have ever experienced, so I honestly don't have any other facility to compare Tim Soder's to. If I did, I might give it 2 stars instead of 1.\nI was recently diagnosed with 'ischial bursitis' and was told by my orthopedic specialist that I would need a couple weeks of physical therapy, going 2-3 times a week. I guess my orthopedic office has a type a partnership with Tim Soder's since they had a representative at the office at the time to schedule an appointment. \n\nAt my first visit, they spent about 1.5 hrs with me. The first 30-45 min was to diagnose the areas that needed to be worked on and I guess set-up a plan for me to follow. The rest of the time was spent in the gym area doing light stretches and exercises. When I was with the physical therapy specialist (?) it was okay, the disappointment started at the 'gym time'. After the diagnosis was done, I was handed off to an athletic trainer. He had me do some warm-ups and some stretches and walked off to help others. There were at least 10 other people in the gym room. Like I said, this is my first time but I honestly thought it was going to be more one-on-one type of an appointment and definitely more attentive. After I was done with each exercise, I'd have to walk across the room to ask him what's next. Seriously, after EVERY EXERCISE. Half way through, he handed me off to another athletic trainer. Same service. At one point of the night I had to wait for him to finish his conversation with his friends for him to give me my next exercise/stretch.  As I was leaving, the receptionist asked me, \""So you're only doing gym time for next session right?\"" Um, isn't that something she should be telling me and not asking me? I just told her no one mentioned anything to me and she looked back at her notes and was like, \""oh yes, looks like you are..\"" I was definitely not very happy with the first appointment. \n\nI decided to not judge too hard, because I really was in no position to have that many expectations.  I thought I'd give it another try to see if maybe the 2nd session would be better. Nope. Same thing. Except this time, there was no 'treatment time'. No one was curious on how I felt after the first session? If I'm sore? If I'm hurting? I had to ask them for different exercises and they were able to give me at least some idea of how to realign my pelvic bone. \n\nIf they had showed me their plan over the next few weeks on what they wanted to work on, like exercises and expected progress, that might have motivated me to return. But with the service I was getting, I felt like I was just throwing $60 down the drain for each 40min session."
1,Great service.  These people know what they are doing when it comes to foot health.  I work on my feet all day - and they are HAPPY FEET now!!  Thanks DeWitt!!!
1,"we  happy to have it great store love their collection, if we  can have a card for discounts above certain amount will be great. great job"
0,Customer service was poor. And the smoothie I got was so awful I had a horrible taste in my mouth for the longest time.
1,"One of the best food trucks in Charlotte! They have a main menu and specials, depending on whats in season. Friendly service, fresh ingredients & GREAT tasting (best burger and fries)!! You pay for the quality, but its worth it!"
0,What a disaster!!!   I mean that in a literal way.  From start to finish this race was a safety hazard for thousands and thousands of people.  Massive crowds that were poorly managed...dark streets in seedy areas with huge potholes....few bathroom facilities along the way (saw more than a few men peeing in the street)...a debacle at Mandalay Bay that was so horrific I saw little babies crying because they couldn't breath in the crowd.  What happened????  This was a fabulous race last year but this year was unforgivable.  I won't be back.
1,"There seems to be a curse on whichever establishment opens up in this old house, but Melt is a parlor that needs to stay. I have my booze, coffee, and food options already taken care of on this road, so an ice cream shoppe is refreshing!\n\nTried the watermelon and cucumber sorbets. None of that fake crap like high fructose corn syrup or artificial flavor...it was all so fresh, you'd think they farmed the fruit that day. The price is reasonable, the quality outstanding, and you get to snack on a fortune cookie at the end. I have no regrets."
0,Gross.
0,"Not really a great experience..  Arrived at about 6pm and was told the wait would be 15-20 minutes.  Ended up being 40 minutes to get a seat.  Normally I wouldn't wait for a place like this, but we had gift cards to use.  We finally got seated in the bar area.. after which there was a bit of confusion on who our server was as 2 people stopped by.. and I think they told each other that they were going to be the one for our table because then nobody really came back and we had to flag one of them down to start drink orders.  \n\nDrinks took a few minutes.. and then we waited another 10-15 minutes for someone to come back to actually take the dinner order.. again we had to flag someone down.  Had to ask for bread at this point.. getting hungry(er).. Salads didn't take too long to get out, but it took another 20 minutes after those were long gone to get the main course out.  \n\nSo the food... I got the ribs and chicken with fries.  The ribs were tough.. I had a real hard time even cutting thru them with a knife.  The chicken was dry and the fries were soggy and luke warm at best.  Plus the food just LOOKED like boring/bland when it got to the table.  Everyone else at the table got some sort of steak.. those seemed serviceable, but nothing spectacular.. but again.. bland looking.  \n\nSo the problems with the service.. I think they were just understaffed and I can't blame the waitstaff that was there as it looked like they were doing their very best... I know that's a tough job, especially when understaffed.\n\nThe food.. was just not good.  In this 2+ hour experience, I would not recommend much... Although I was not drinking, the people I was with said the drinks were good.. strong.. So I guess that's a positive."
0,"Absolutely the worst water park experience I have had. They clearly rushed to open this place the landscape isn't finish so there's rocks everywhere. Some of the cement is painted so when your feet are wet it's slippery and the stairs are plastic and very slippery when wet. The lines are extremely confusing and slow moving. There is one set of narrow stairs the leads up to 4 slides so it takes forever. They base the slides off of weight and constantly had to tell people they were too \""fat\"" to ride this ride and when you finally get to the top and go down the slide there is rubber stoppers to slow you down making the ride extremely just not fun. I will never recommend this park or go back it's just a terrible experience."
1,"the most heavenly brunch everrrrrrrrr. sophia's is that cool artist girl that everyone has a mini-crush on b/c she's soooooooooo incredibly sweet. sure, a little on the absent-minded side but she has such infectious enthusiasm for life that all your hair-brained poor life choices totally seem feasible. ahhh heart heart heart!\n\nalso. what is with the dbag writing a review w/o eating here? stop hating FIB!"
0,"They have a large variety of food, but recently the quality has taken a serious nose dive. We were there last night and there was more fat than meat in my slice of brisket. Disgusting. The potato pancakes were burnt, the biscuits hard as hockey pucks and the only cooked vegetables we could find were beets cooked with apples. Yuck. Even the pecans on my slice of pie were burnt and the filling was dry and rubbery. We will not be going back anytime soon."
0,Did not enjoy my meal ... In fact all for of us didnt. The enchilada sauce was watered down. the tostada shell was  burnt and soggy . Possible. Very nice people and a clean restaurant. But would not go back.
0,"Pediatricians do not meet and greet or interview... \n\nI am pregnant with my first child so as most hospitals tell you in all your preparation classes, \""Interview Pediatricians.\"" My OB's office is in the same center as Mesa Pediatrics so I stopped in to ask some routine questions such as is the office accepting new patients and do they accept my health insurance and do they have access to the hospital I will be delivering at. In addition I also wanted to see about making an appointment to meet / interview any of their doctors at this location. \n\nAccording to the gal at the front desk, none of the doctors at this location do interviews or meet and greets. She told me I could view their profiles on their website. That doesn't really provide a feel for the doctor other than what they can do or have done - doesn't show the type of bedside manner or even if you will like them. Being in the hospital with a newborn and a first time mom is not the time I would like to find out that I hate my child's doctor. \n\nI was told I could go to their Tempe location and interview the doctors there but none of the Tempe doctors work at this location. So how does that help me to choose a doctor at the location I was at and she said that it really didn't. \n\nShe did mention that other people have left their pediatricians to go to their office but not being able to meet with them to see why, that isn't enough for me to choose them as my doctor's office for my child. \n\nThen she said that I could ask around and see what other people thought of this location but of course they can't provide a list of people who go to their offices. Why even mention that??? What was the point of that? \n\nI was so frustrated by that conversation. \n\nIf you are currently interviewing pediatricians, you can cross this one off of your list of phone calls and drop-ins since the doctors will not meet with anyone who is not a current patient. \n\nI did ask a few of my friends who do have children about my experience and they did tell me this is unusual or they have not heard of this happening. \n\nSo if the doctor that I do wind up taking my child to doesn't work out, I'll interview with other pediatricians before I even think about taking my child here."
1,"We brought about 25 people here for a company dinner during the Epic Systems Forum. Arranged a pris fixe menu in advance with the group coordinator (Fred). The restaurant came through for us in all respects. Great food, great service, excellent wine list with many nice wines available by the glass, and surprisingly inexpensive. 43 North is the latitude of Madison, in case you're wondering."
0,"Fire hazard and a shithole to boot. Was there over july 4th weekend, and the club was so dangerously overpacked that people would have probably died if any sort of fight or fire broke out there. We ended up having our table moved downstairs after the host tried to put us in a broom closet sized table for 8 of us. \n\nXS made this place look like a dump."
1,"Wanted to try a local coffee place and our cousin recommended Bergies. They make a delicious caramel latte! Too bad I didn't see any ice blends on the menu, or else I'd return for that ^.^"
0,"Where do I start? What a waste of money, TIME, and a night of our Vegas vacation. The entire show from the beginning to the end was a complete disappointment. It was way too immature and boring- even for children. I enjoy the drums but this was just a lame show that I honestly would strongly discourage anyone from going to this show."
0,"I love their chicken, that's why I'll give them a star. Horrible service. I waited for about 45 minutes until I was helped in the drive through. There were only five cars and I had to wait around 20 minutes to finally get my order taken and some girl said, give me a sec and I said that's fine. 20 minutes later again, I waited, there was no cars in front of me. I was so angry I just drove to their window and finally they took my order. Can't believe how rude they were. She didn't even say sorry and that's all I wanted was an apology. Best believe, I will never be coming back."
0,None of the 3 copy machines they have in the lobby work. If you want copies you have to wait in line for someone behind the counter to make them for you and that can take forever!!!! How bout you FIX at least ONE of the three copy machines you have just sitting there?!?!?!
0,"My boyfriend and I ordered delivery using a coupon. The driver was great but the coupon was not applied to our bill (the person who took our order never verfied the total when he took our order). When we called to have this fixed they offered to credit us the difference for our next visit- which was not helpful because we don't eat there often. When they finally offered to refund our money and we started eating our garlic knots were completely raw inside, the wings weren't good, and our pizza was mostly sauce. We didn't bother calling to let them know that our food was raw because they probably would have offered us free food in the future and we have no plans to eat there again. ever."
0,"Ugh, this place was so cheesy. It's like they tried to make a really trendy bar with a budget of $100. Trading Spaces gone horribly wrong. \n\nThe mirror at the table we were sitting at was broken, there were uncomfortable clear plastic chairs to sit in, a long velour/velvet (I really don't know what this material was) couch, techno music. Aaahhh! Why did I come here? \n\nAnd after all of that, the drinks are expensive. \n\nThe outside patio looked nice, but I never made my way out there. \n\nI won't be back. Too bad because this is in a good location in Old Town."
1,"Love this place! This new restaurant is set in a Spanish villa and has a fun and classy ambiance! There is a huge patio complete with small firepits and an outdoor bar.  There is plenty of parking available as well. \nThe menu is Tex-Mex. There are plenty of delicious vegetarian options. Everything is reasonably priced, and the food is delicious. Would DEFINITELY recommend the Calamari as a starter. This is probably one of the best versions of calamari I have ever had. The guacamole, salsa, and cheese are pretty good, not the best. The tacos are delicious!\nThey serve beer, wine, and cocktails. They have a very creative and interesting cocktail list. \nGreat ambiance, delicious food, great drinks, and reasonable pricing. I will definitely be back!!"
1,"Delicious crust, very friendly workers, clean establishment, and SUPER convenient for NW Las Vegas. Ill definitely be coming here more often!!"
0,"Like people always say I would give zero stars but yelp forces me to give one star. I had an appointment with Dr. Adams three weeks ago. I looked on yelp to see the reviews and saw that the number one complaint was the wait time and let me tell you YES plan on at least a three hour appointment. I arrived for my 1pm appointment 15 minutes early to fill out paperwork, big mistake since I had a whole hour and half before I even was called back for my vitals to be taken. In that hour and half wait time I spoke with another patient who said that this is ALWAYS the case. As soon as a sat down another person walked in for her 1pm appointment. Fantastic!!!! So double booking appointments. Apparently the staff and the doctor are well aware of this problem but nothing is being done to fix this problem. When I was finally seen by Dr. Adams and told her about my medical history the first thing she offered for a solution was a medical marijuana license. Wtf?!?? Are you kidding me? If I wanted that it thought I need that I would have called Dr, Reefer's number from the signs off the 15 freeway not wait for almost two hours for my 1pm appointment. So she decides to run a full blood panel (can't wait for the bill on that one). It's been three weeks now and haven't heard a peep, so I call this morning to see if I can talk to her or at least get my lab results. \""She's out of town\"" says the office assistance \""and if you want to talk to her it's best to make an appointment.\"" I explain I work two jobs, one if then being owning a hair salon and I don't have time to make an \""appointment\"" and wait to be seen three hours later. Her response \""well she has a busy practice and that's what all our patients complain about.\"" Again WTF?!? So Dr. Adams why are you still over booking, taking new patients, when you know this is a problem, and why should I have to take time out of my day, not book my clients and lose out on money to pay you to sit there for ours all to ask you one question? It seems you may have your priorities messed up. And as far as my lab results go which she seemed to be extremely concerned about, the receptionist explained that they just came in only on the 17th, that was 8 days ago lady. Stop making excuses for your lack of care for your patients!!! I will not be returning to your crappy practice. This doctor and her staff are horrible and just care about jamming as many clients in a day as possible to squeeze out as much money as they can.  Shame on your Dr. Adams wasn't there an oath you took when you became a doctor!!!"
0,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I waited over an hour to get my fill. They said it would be \""just a few minutes\"". I would have just left but they put my friends feet in the water for her pedicure so we were trapped. She was in the water 30 minutes before they came to her. I also watched them give a full face wax to a woman. They didn't take her in the back room or anything. Just did it right there in front of everyone."
0,"The manager openly cursed in front of a 9yr old's birthday party family members. He was a jerk and was basically shoving the family out of the tables, not giving us any time to even find a new table. \nHe was a total ass. And the cashier was a complete bitch. Her attitude was disgusting.\nDefinitely gonna head to a different place next birthday party."
0,"Too expensive for not real cheesesteaks, they were on a sandwich roll not even on a Philly roll. And everything is all a cart. And everything is way too overpriced, $35 for two people."
0,"Either they need to hire more baristas or they need to work in faster pace.  I ordered a very simple drink and waited for over 5 minutes for it.  It was also during evening rush hours, but that shouldn't be the reason why my drink took a long time to make.  Not impressed at all."
0,"Found two different items on were the blueberries, on two different sides of a table display. All the containers were the same size 18oz. On one side the price listed $3.68 on the other side of the table $5.68. Exactly the same product, same weight, same manufacturer. \nThe other were Sandisk 2-pack (Cruzer Glide, USB flash drive), 16gb each for 19.00 after immediate discount at register. With tax comes to about $21.00. Sitting directly on top of the ones on discount were others that were also 16 gb each, however were about $27. Didn't realize until I'm at the register. I believe when stores do this it's a conscious  marketing decision to deceive the consumer. That's what I get for not reading further on the description. Their hope is that we will get to the check out and pay for the higher priced item, because we don't want to go back to make the exchange. Welllllllllll, I didn't purchase the $27 ones, did complete my purchase. \nI also found Dreft detergent less expensive at Target."
0,"After my review of Salsita's 6, I've come to have faith in the cumulative point rating system. \nSImply enumerate the various categories and let the chips fall so to speak.\n\nPhoenix Police Department.\n\nFive stars for my arresting officer and how interested he was in my life...asking a ton of questions...seeing the real me as a person instead of just another perpetrator.\nHe seemed genuinely concerned about me, and under any other circumstances, I could totally see me and him as besties. \nYou just don't see that kind of caring any more.\n\nAnother five for his using nylon ties in lieu of those pesky steel handcuffs.\nAnd yet another three for his super clean backseat. I thought it would smell like puke or crack dealer or something.\n\nWhere are we, thirteen so far?\n\nMinus five for the butch officer who fingerprinted me and failed to acquiesce to my request for a hairbrush and some product prior to the mugshot. I looked like Nick Nolte and Gary Busey's illegitimate child.\n\nAnother minus five for the Madison Street Jail facility and its 'open' toilets in the holding tank. If you have shy bladder syndrome, this is not the place for you after a night of prodigious drinking.\n\nAnd I'm going with a negative two for what I think may have been an egg Mcmuffin they served up for breakfast, although I'm not really sure what it was.\n\nOverall, I'd say this wasn't as bad an experience as all my friends let on.\nAnd, it does give me the chance to get to see if Philips and Associates are as good they say.\n\nWhere's that leave us.\nYeah, no, pretty sure that's one star. \nHmm.\nProbably won't repeat."
0,"Is it better than your average fast food place? Yes. Is it the best BBQ ever? No way! \n\nBut Dickeys food is decent. Food is cheap Ribs and pulled pork are good, rolls and okra- darn good. \n\nWent in the other day because I didn't want to cook, and after watching \""Super Size Me'\"" about a month ago, I stay away from the obvious \""fast food\"" restaurants completely. So, craving some red meat I went to Dickeys for take out because it was close and I figured their food wouldn't be as processed as McD's- seriously that movie gave me nightmares. \n\nThe staff was super friendly, the football game was on TV., the food was done quickly- giving me enough time to make myself a root beer float and watch AZ lose in OT- :( \n\nFor 3 of us I ordered the ribs, the turkey, coleslaw, mac and cheese, fried okra, potato casserole, and 2 rolls. \n\nWhen I got home I was disappointed to see that the turkey looked like processed poo on a plate. Really guys- picture slimy poo on a plate-it was that gross! I refused to taste it, and everyone else was brave enough to at least try it, only to decide they couldn't eat more than 1 bite- but the dog thought it was delicious. \n\nNever tried the potato casserole because Dickeys forgot to pack it. The mac and cheese was gross! I'm not a salt person, but it definitely needed salt and pepper to give it flavor and the macaroni was over cooked to that gross slimy noodle consistency. \n\nSo, the 3 of us shared 4 ribs, okra, and an individual size coleslaw with 2 rolls- one person was hungry enough to go ahead and eat the mac and cheese even though he didn't like it. \n\nDickeys would have gotten 1 star but the ribs and okra were pretty darn good and I made one hell of a root beer float while I was there. \n\nI may be seen in Dickeys again because I have a fondness for fried okra and I have tried their pulled pork Sandwiches before and liked it. But I will definitely check my takeout before I leave to make sure it is all there and I will never order the mac and cheese or processed turkey poo again."
1,"I live in St. George, UT and the weather this morning was the perfect temperature, for a pool side gel manicure and gel pedicure! I am so happy right now, honestly I have tried the few spas that we do have here in St. George and my nails and toes have NEVER looked so Awesome! Sad thing is I don't have a choice but, to go and get my nails and toes done @ a salon, walking away very disappointed!! I have NEVER EVER had a nail technician educate me on what products to use and how to use them. The products Tammy uses are organic it was a mineral salt with a yummy scent. Matter fact my skin was so soft afterwards Tammy didn't need to apply the Hyaluron Avec du Hyaluron. So I asked Tammy can I but this all over my body!:) I have horrible cuticles and Tammy educated me on what product to use. Remind you this isn't lack of getting my nails or toes done consistently. I will be going to Vegas for now on!!! Hugs, loves and a BIG, BIG Thank You! Can't wait to see in a few weeks! Dani Rae-"
1,"We stayed at this gorgeous hotel on New Year's Eve and had a great time.  The room was very large and nice - we booked a corner king room to ensure we had the large bathtub.  The bathroom was my favorite part of the hotel room.  A really cool rain shower, amazing views of the city and that bathtub was epic.  \n\nOverall a very chic feel.  So clean!  And on top of it, the staff was great, quick and very accommodating."
0,"My friend and I went  to Cafepino to have a bite of supper before a movie.  We were going to share a pizza & a salad.  The owner was our waiter.  We were ordering the the Marguarite pizza.  The owner said which one ... there are 2 ... one without garlic and the one with fresh garlic for an additional $2.  I said you charge $2 for a few cloves of garlic.  He immediately said \""pizza with no garlic\"".  Then he said I suppose you want water to drink, which we did.  I have never encountered such a rude, arrogant restaurant owner.  As I sat for a few minutes, I decided I did not want to give this restaurant one penny of my money and I canceled our order.  The owner opened the door and shouted \""out out out out\""  Then he had the audacity to tell me that there was a Wendy's and McDonald's in the shopping center.  How insulting could he be ... how dare he intimate that I did not have money for a decent dinner!  My advice to this\nunwise man is not to judge a book by its cover.  Although I was dressed plainly, I regularly dine at many 4 and 5 star restaurants.  I will never set foot in Cafepino again and will advice all my friends and family to do the same.  I suspect he will lose a great deal of business from tonight's episode."
0,"This is the place to go to if you are out with your friends looking for cheap going out clothes. They know their market they have good items at great prices- which is exactly what the girls who shop there are looking for.\nWith that said- i was not pleased with my experience. The merchandise is cheap- but you get what you pay for- but there were also no small sizes. I'm a xsmall or small depending and there was nothing for me to even try on, everything was a size large. Also, I was shocked that while me and about 5 other girls were in there shopping the two sales girls were in the fitting rooms trying things on! I'm sorry but you need to help your shoppers- not yourself. you do that once you close or before your open but not while your on the clock.\nTheir accessories were cute- $8 sunglasses were pretty great, but i couldnt get myself to buy anything. I didnt want to help them if they werent going to help me."
1,"always a rock solid dining experience at Carrabba's, and the staff at this location is the best, in my opinion. The lentil soup is as good as any I've had. One of our standby's, and one of the few chain restaurants we actually frequent."
1,"I always make sure to visit Henderson's at least once when I journey to Edinburgh. Eating vegetarian is a nice change and Henderson's does it well.\n\nI normally opt for a portion of whatever vegetable soup they have on that day. The soup and the bread it comes with are both pleasant. If I had to criticise, I think sometimes that the soups are slightly under seasoned, but all the tables have salt and paper so it's nothing you can't sort out yourself.\n\nI am less enthusiastic about their dessert offerings, however. There's nothing offensive about them, they're just not particularly inspiring. You can expect to see cute looking strawberry tartlets and pastries with kiwi fruit and stuff. It all looks perfectly nice through the glass, but when you get it, you find the pastry is a little heavy and it just doesn't match the higher standards that their savoury food sets.\n\nI'd recommend Henderson's for lunch and lunch only. It's ideal for a quick bite to eat for a friend and perhaps something sweet after. The food is not unforgettable, but at the prices Henderson's charges, you don't expect it to be."
0,Over 6 calls to Walker last night. Disconnected each time. Either intentionally or mechanical doesn't matter. When calling back receptions should have stayed on line if Walker really wants to correct this and got a person on phone with me. Continued stalls tactics by the dishonest Walker company..
1,"Decided to go for some Greek and Mediterranean food tonight and kind of threw a dart at the board and it landed on Good Fellas Grill. I generally haven't had a great experience with Greek food but boy was that changed during this visit. Walked in, only about 3 people there, presentation of the restaurant was pretty nice. Had that typical look you'd expect from a place like this, very comfortable eating environment. \n\nHad no idea what to order so I went with some lettuce wraps and the owner Ninos threw in some lentil and potato soup. Awesome! Food came out within 2 minutes. Perfect! Potato soup was great. Lettuce wraps were amazing. Honestly, I was shocked on what I've been missing. I almost want to travel back for seconds now. Ninos suggested another selection and I'm motivated to come back and check it out!\n\nThis is how you run a business right here. The customer service was flawless and honestly so was the food. For the price it's worth it. I wish I could give a better rating, so I will 6 stars! Sorry Yelp! I'm breaking the rules on this one."
0,"The hotel isn't bad considering it's catering to the more mature audience.  The only thing that somewhat upsets me is that the price of the rooms are misleading.  You better read the fine print when reserving a room here because they might not inform you about the $14.95 per night surcharge.  Me and my friends wanted to find a fairly inexpensive hotel and when we booked online on expedia, the rooms were only $42/night.  But when we got there, we were informed of the ridiculous surcharge.  I can understand if it was something like $5.00 or something but $14.95?? If it was still summer time when we can at least use their ugly pool, i can also at least understand that.  I mean, even the GOLD COAST which is much more decent than Palace Station has a surcharge of only $3.00!  Okay, live and learn i guess.  Well, at least whoever is reading this could use the heads up, right? :)"
0,"Beautiful restaurant and open lounge made this place look inviting and we sst at a low table in the lounge. Service was prompt, but the food was so-so and zero stars go to the appetizer calamari, which was pressed fish that was soft, soggy and horrible. It tasted like they'd bought it from the freezer section of a supermarket and then put it on a pretty plate and aquifers green sauce on it. My husband and I thought it was the worst calamari we've ever had and we've never seen calamari that looked like soft fish sticks. The miso soup was good and the two rolls we ordered were just okay and nothing special. Very disappointing that they put so much effort into the decor and not the food."
0,Sad to say I was very disappointed with my burger! :( It was very dry and plain. I would rather eat in n out.. Definitely not worth the price!!!
0,This was adequte at best and that is being generous.  Several of us Went today for Easter brunch - big disappointment.  The restaurant was not that busy - took 20 minutes between courses being served.  Needed to ask for plates for the muffins.  Ordered the filet with eggs - the eggs were burnt and broken.  The server never should have brought that plate to the table.  I expect this from Denny's at 3 am - not a restaurant with these menu prices.  My boyfriend had the tomato bisque soup - was Ragu in a bowl - even same consistency.  Another friend had the bananas foster french toast - even the bananas were bland.
1,Had the steak and frites several times.  It's always consistent and tasty.  Definitely a winner in my book.
1,"Pros.. \n1. Variety of food and they are good (fresh oyster, crab leg, very good dessert bar and many more!) \n2. The service is good \n\nCons..\n1. We had to wait 3 hours.. (After waiting 1 hr I got a text that the table is almost ready so we went to check in. After the check in we had to wait in the line for 1.5 hrs to pay for the buffet and another 30 mins to be seated) \n2. $59.99 per person for dinner w/ total rewards card (it was a holiday rate but the guy said the regular price is only few dollars cheaper than this) \n3. People can pay $15 extra to skip the line which makes non-express line ppl wait even longer"
0,Unfriendly people = no tip for you
0,"Mediocre at best.  My fiance and I ordered our old favorite, chicken fajitas.  The peppers were colorful, but not cooked all the way.  The rice and beans were adequate.\n\nThe chips and salsa were not homemade.. AT ALL.  The chips looked like they came from a bag and the salsa was definitely from a jar.  No flavor and nothing special.  \n\nAll in all I have yet to experience good Mexican food out here in Vegas and have had better luck back in NY where I came from."
1,"Why didn't I come here when I was drunk at 4am and craving a steak and shrimp special in Vegas?!?!?!  Well, after being disappointed that all the steak specials in downtown Vegas end before midnight, I ate some shitty greasy pizza and that did not satisfy my craving for drunken steak. \n\nSo after partying all night, I woke up still craving a steak special and headed on over to Ellis Island! Keep in mind this is slightly off the strip and a dump, so do not by any means expect the flashiness of newer Vegas. \n\nThe $7.99 steak and beer dinner is a secret menu special, which I don't get why but whatever. I don't care much for beer and I had had enough alcohol the night before, so I got a little fancy and went for the $10 steak and shrimp special. My special came with steak, fried shrimp, mashed potatoes, green beans, and a salad. The salad sucked!!! The Italian dressing was really oily and the salad tasted not so fresh. \n\nMy steak and shrimp however were so good!!!! I asked for medium well, and I definitely got it. The mashed potatoes and gravy were also delicious and went great with the steak and shrimp. I tried the beer that came with my friend's steak specials, not so impressive, but then again I don't like beer, so don't listen to me lol. One of my friends steaks was not so great, he asked for well and I think got medium, which he was not nuts about. \n\nI just read there's $10 rib and chicken special!!! That's enough to bring me back!!!  Not gonna lie though, the service is kinda shitty, so I think overall Ellis Island gets 3.5 stars. I agree with all the other reviews that say you should come when you're shitfaced. You won't care as much about the bad service, and your food will probably taste way better."
1,"Halcyon is one of those places you go when the boss is paying. So on such an occasion we decided to do just that. \nI am not such an adventurous eater so I stuck to the basics. I ate the cheese burger and fries and it was delicious! The burger was so tender it fell apart, so I ended up eating it with a fork. The fries were delicious. Regular mixed with sweet potato and seasoned with rosemary! \nFor dessert I had the 'coffee and donuts'. The little donut holes were pretty good but the \""coffee\"" was amazing. It was more like a chocolate mousse! Wonderful meal. \nI will ask to go back on my next company paid lunch. \n\nForgot to mention, our waiter was wonderful!"
0,"Yep, just meh. The pizza is pretty big, but bigger is not always better my friends. Pizza had no flavor-I felt like I put peppers, salt, and parm on this poor piece of pizza but nothing really made it much better. Crust was also just a boring crust. \n\nService was good-people were nice. The place was clean-had a few T.Vs around with sports and shows. Not busy at all on a Wednesday night-but not many places really are. Probably won't come back."
1,"We were going to dinner somewhere Saturday night and happen to see this place from the road. Quickly looked up Yelp and decided to give this place a try instead. A gastropub in Chandler. Intriguing! It's an interesting little place that seems nice. The crowd seems to be older for that night. Majority of the guests were in their 50-60s. \n\nWe saw pork belly on the yelp reviews but alas there weren't any when we went. We ordered the claim chowder and the bruschetta as apps. The chowder was nice but didn't stand out. I guess I should say it was pleasant. For the bruschetta we chose the goat cheese, the wild mushrooms, and the olives. We both really liked the goat cheese with the carmelized onions. Although both of us felt that it would be even better if the goat cheese was warm. I liked the mushrooms and my gf liked the olives.\n\nFor entree we picked the beef short ribs, the elk o'bucco, and the crab cakes. The crab cakes were seasoned well and very yummy. The Elk was very dry. It's definitely missing a component of fat to address the dryness. The short rib was much better texture wise. My gf and I both felt that the elk and the beef were vastly under seasoned and needed salt. \n\nThe service was pleasant and the place definitely has potential to be quite good. I'd say 3.5 stars but another half for potential."
0,It was okay I've been there before in California. I think this 1 is a little different for me sometimes depends on the location but I didn't really enjoy it Planet Hollywood. Get customer service but other than that I didn't really enjoy the food there. If it is a next time maybe I should try the 1 in Green Valley.
1,"One of the best buffets of my life. No joke. Line was long for it, so that's a good sign but that's the case with all Vegas buffets. It's about $50 a head on Saturdays for dinner. Good selection of many things. Highlights for me include: freshly cut prime rib, medium rare with a great crust. Leg of lamb. Crab legs already split for you, no cracking necessary. It's crack-a-lacking. Truffle Risotto. Macarons. Gelato. Bone marrow. Shrimp and grits. Shrimp cocktail and ceviche. Everything else was really good and very un-buffet like but those were the star attractions for me personally. Obviously it's not for everyone and it depends on your taste buds. It seems they offer things seasonally or only once in a while so not everything is always the same each time you come. I had so much seafood and prime rib that I got my money back in my belly in no time and then some! Great buffet, I can't wait to come back and try some of the other Vegas buffets but thus far, one of the best for me."
1,"This pizza was awesome !!\nIt's very unuiqe then other pizza I had, the guy up front explained to me how they prepare the pizza, the cheese being placed on cold, or not melted. It did take a while, despite not being very busy, but, I'm willing to wait for food like this. I did notice that they included everybody except EMS on their list of discounts, though. Don't forget your medics/emts, please ! :("
1,"This Mediterranean restaurant has a really great weekend buffet, as Rand H., Mike C. found out during our buffet excursion here. I started the meal with a mild but tasty lentil soup, then went on to a refreshing parsley salad, savory meatballs, tasty vegetable dishes (vegetarians will like this place for sure) ... and the *best* shawarma I've ever had!  And just when I thought it couldn't get any better, as I was paying for the meal I noticed trays of tempting baklava near the cashier (sneaky!) ... these came in almond, walnut and pistachio, and I just had to try the pistachio one. It was pure heaven, buttery goodness with an abundance of crushed pistachio and dripping with honey -- an awesome finish to an amazing meal."
1,"It's an interesting joint. You would swear you were in the middle of a residential area, then the place appears.\n\nI found it on a Tuesday night, in the 'Burgh for a couple of days. The beer specials are solid, and it made me smile to hear that any beer not from PA is considered an import.\n\nCross your fingers that Amy is working the bar... She's a charmer."
0,"The only reason this place even gets two stars is because a really nice waitress took over our service. We were seated waited for 10 minutes before anyone came to even acknowledge us. After that they brought us out waters but didn't bring our actual drink orders for another 20 minutes, or came to take our order. Meanwhile other parties were seated and served right away. Anyway, the service was absolutely awful. Make sure to bring a guy next time you stop by."
1,"Great for all your bulky needs!  The best part? THE FOOD COURT! polish sausages, pizza, chicken bakes, soft serve,smoothies each under $4! The only reason for the 4 stars is the fact that not all Costcos carry the same items.\n*they also have appetizer (samples) spread throughout the warehouse as well."
1,"Stephanos used to be my go-to place for Greek and Mediterranean, but I think from now on I'll go here! The best and yummiest thing about this place: COMPLIMENTARY pita bread with za'atar and olive oil. Unlike other Greek places, the hot and fresh pita bread is made with love in the kitchen. I could solely eat this, and be 100% satisfied. \n\nBut moving forth, I ordered the gyro shawarma (the beef and lamb mix) plate, and tasted the falafel. I realize that I can't eat too much red meat, or it'll upset my stomach, and the plate comes with a ton of meat. Thank goodness for the hummus and rice, because they both balance out the richness of the meat. Lastly, the falafel was delish. None of the spices were too overwhelming, and although fried, it felt light on the stomach. Next time I come here, I'm definitely going to order the falafel instead of meat. :)"
1,Been here a lot lately and really don't have any complaints. Enjoy the atmosphere and the food. Never had a problem.
1,"I wish i saved the pictures on my phone to share this experience with you all. \n\nLocated inside Cesar's Palace, near Spago and Guess.  Faves and I were both intrigued by this place due to the name of the restaurant and the similarity of it.  Max \""chocolate by the bald guy\""..just took off the last name.  Pretty crazy.  \n\nWe came in close to 7 or 8pm and there werent many people in there and I dont know why.  This is such a good place!  We ordered the smoke rub chicken wings, bacon-cheddar-chicken rolls and mac & cheese. I would tell you how they were individually but I would max out the 5k character limit on my review.  Definetely have to try them out, really good quality food!  \n\nDrinks: I ordered the satisfaction guaranteed aphrodisiac chocolate drink which was spectacular and faves order a berry something chocolate drink which was also great as well.  For dessert, we settled for the fried bananas and asked for both the dark and milk chocolate dippings sauces which also came with a toffee dipping sauce as well.  So damn good!!\n\nI wish they had something like this in frisko.  This would be one of those things that i can wait in line for.  Many props to our waiter Ismael who took care of my friend and I.  Very kind man, who knows the menu (food and drinks) very well!"
1,"If you havn't been here yet, YOU ARE SLIPPING UP! Food is excellent. The moist brisket is to die for. Their msides are extremely tasty, includint the slaw, mac n cheese, the potato salad, beans, ALL OF EM ARE GREAT.  The service is great and they give you samples when you walk in!"
1,"Happened to be in the neighborhood and since we had a coupon for a free appetizer we decided to stop and have an early dinner. There was plenty of parking\nWe got there early, 5 PM, was seated in the back, only a couple of tables from the server's station.. The food was good and hot which is pretty consistent with all the other Chili Restaurants. Server was attentive.\nMy wife had the Southwestern Eggrolls for her dinner and I had the classic Bacon Burger.  Everything was good as usual.\nWhen we left, the place was filling up for a Thursday."
0,"Since my return to Pittsburgh, I have been to the \""new\"" Elbow Room several times. The food has always been decent and the location on Walnut is convenient when I'm in the neighborhood shopping.  \n\nToday I went for a late lunch.  Honestly, there were 5 people in the restaurant.  It took forever for food to arrive at our table.  Could it be attributed to the fact that I was eating somewhere between lunch and dinner and they aren't sufficiently staffed?  I don't know.  My beloved was happy as always with his ENORMOUS fish sandwich.  My reuben sandwich was just okay.  The corned beef was pretty chewy.  Probably should have gotten a salad.  \n\nI'm hoping that I just caught them on a bad afternoon."
1,Can you believe we got a table on Valentines day? I'm an idiot since I don't celebrate holidays but Red Devil doesn't take reservation.\nI had the stand by spaghetti and italian sausage. My friend had lasagna.\nAs usual the service was excellent and the food delicious. The 40 minute wait went be quickly since we already had so much to talk about.\nThis is just a great local spot.
1,Unbelievable experience!  Just moved here from Chicago and my mom is a hair stylist.  I've always been very wary of getting my hair cut as I never had to pay for it.  I was done up by Radi and he was absolutely amazing!  Attention to detail and precision were second to none.  Best haircut in my life!
1,"I know that Wolfgang's restaurants are very hit-or-miss, but I do find that the ones in Las Vegas are all quite reputable. This one located in the MGM just across from the KA Ticket office is excellent.\n\nDelicious and hearty American fare at reasonable prices (for the generous portions). We got the burger, pork belly sandwich, and a side of mac and cheese - for two people, we were stuffed and ended up bringing half of our dinner home for late night! The sandwiches were $17 each (but both had huge sides of fries or Greek macaroni salad) and the Mac n Cheese was $12. \n\nService was top notch and continuously attentive. The ambiance is casual but still contemporary inside with an open-faced layout facing the casino outward. Great for dates, small groups, large groups, or just to get a bite to eat any time of the day. They are open daily until 5AM!"
1,"I miss the 80's, Miami Vice, etc.  Seviche reminds me very much of miami vice, don johnson, crocket...   I've been to seviche several times and it's a good spot if it's not too crowded.  It's usually either my first stop or one of my last stops  if I'm staying at the Westin and walking.  Last night it was my 3rd stop out of about a dozen stops and our server was so nice KATE I thought I'd write a review just to give her some props'.  I was there around 8 PM last night and we were able to quickly find a table even though it was relatively crowded.  I'd say the crowd for the most part is a little older than some of the other bars that I frequent, but friendly all the same.  It's going for the south beach theme and it accomplishes this with its high ceilings and art deco interior.  Bright lights big windows high top tables a few couches and a large bar with another sushi type bar.  The bathrooms are nice and overall the space is very warm if a little bit cheesy.  The service is usually good when I frequent here, but last night it was stellar.  Kate gave us great tips all night long and guided a very nice dining experience.  I had very deliciousl ketel one rocks dirty's most of the night and my friend had delicious mojitos'.  These mojitos are good, but for some reason I just love the ones at Dish.  We had so many small plates, I'm sure I'll forget a few.  We started with an amazing blue point oyster \""fire and ice\"" which were fresh and delicious.  The preperation is spicy with habernaro peppers red onion and a prickly pear ice topping. It really is there signature dish and I recommend you get the fire and ice preparation when you come.  It's spicy and cool with delicious fresh seafood.  We followed this up with the crab and scallop, same fire and ice preparation.  This dish is light and flavorful and melds well with a stiff cocktail.  We also tried the tuna ginger tataki, which is quick seared #1 grade ahi served with ginger fennel and some type of mayo, I'd say spiced with wasabi.  It was also quite good.  We also tried the mussels which started good, fresh and plump, but then had a few that had not so much of a fresh flavor.  Overall it was a miss.  Go to Pointe Brugge for your mussels.  We may have had another dish, but can't quite recall.  Overall this is a good spot in the cultural district for an urban theme, stiff drinks, and light fresh food."
1,"Went for weekday lunch on a Friday and there was a small wait so we opted for the communal tables. Slight snafu when our waitress didn't realize our party was three and not the five that all sat down around the same time, and she started taking someone else's order with ours, but it was easily sorted out. The communal tables are a bit too wide across so you have to speak up to talk across them, but I'd sit there again. \n\nOverall I was impressed with the look and feel of the place - there's a very \""natural\"" vibe carried through the decor and open air/sunlight that enhances the food. \n\nThe food was on the pricey side but the quality was apparent. To drink we all got the honey lemonade which was so simple but really excellent and comes with a free refill. I'd go back just for that! My companions enjoyed their open-faced salmon and the shaved turkey pita which each came with a side of mixed kale/sweet potato hash. I had the chicken panang curry which was tasty with fresh ingredients and well cooked, but I agree with the other reviewer that the ratio of sauce to rice seems off and too soupy. \n\nMy companions had tried the salads on previous visits and thought they were much too small for the money. For the price, I thought we got our money's worth."
1,Great store with good discounts on quality products.
1,"This is why I liked Ghostbar, and why I would go back:\n\nBouncers, bartenders, and overall staff was friendly\nThe place was clean\nTolerable club music\nBeautiful view\nIt was not over crowded \nIt did not smell bad\nThe music was not so loud that my ears wanted to explode\nNo cover for hotel guests\nAir conditioning \n\nThis is what I deducted a star:\n\nWe had purchased a Travel Zoo coupon which included dinner to Simon, and VIP to either Ghostbar or the other club at the Palms. The person at the front of Ghostbar told us that if we chose to use our VIP bracelets, then we would get two free drinks. When we went up to the bar, the bartender told us that we did not get free drinks. It did not ruin my night, but if we knew we weren't going to get any perks from the VIP bracelets, we would have used them at another place. \n\nThis place is having an identity crisis. Are you a lounge or a club?"
0,"I would choose no star if I could. A bunch of us girls from SF came to AZ for a bachelorette party. We came to this bar and was harassed for what the bald headed bouncer thought was a fake id. Come on we're celebrating a bachelorette! We're all 30+.  He held on to one of our girls id for more than half and hour telling us he was going to have the police validate. Well, we suspected he never told the police, he was just trying not to let us in, because we were asian. we were very disappointed to see that all non asians were let in the bar as the bouncer hugged every girl. So we finally called the police and before we got through the bouncer got nervous and gave us our id back. In a college town, in Western america we get discrimination??? \n\nThey will be getting a notice from the Better Business Bureau soon. \n\nThanks a lot for ruining our Saturday night Baldie. You should be ashamed of yourselves."
1,I had a few dents that I needed to repair on my brand new car and Findlay Customs was right next to my work. I went in and talked to JJ and I can't be happier with this decision. My car looks flawless. JJ was very professional and took great care of me. Picked up my car today and my year is made. You can't even tell that there was body damage. I would strongly recommend this place!!!
0,Downright awful - shrimp were way overcooked - total mush.  Spice blend all water - nothing flavored the meat (makes me wonder if shrimp were pre-cooked and dumped in bag of spice soup)\n\nAnd we had a lot- of people - not just one bad batch\n\nMussles were ok\nCorn fritters didn't have much fritternessx- chunks of corn fried\n\nNot at all pleased\n\nMushy shrimp = bleh
1,"'d kept it in mind in case anything happened that could be treated there instead of at one of my regular doctor. Trying to get an appointment for anything at my doctors' office is difficult. So I went to this center and quickly was underway to see the doctor on a Saturday night. There was a little wait time, but in short order I saw a doctor who quickly took care of my problem. I appreciated being able to use my Medicare and Blue Cross/Blue Shield health insurance for full payment. Conveniently, I was also able to have my prescription filled at a moderate price. The office staff is polite, intelligent and helpful. The clinic is open long hours, plenty of safe parking and it is spotless as far as I could tell. I don't want to get sick, but for some situations this clinic will be a helpful part of my health care as long as we are both in the neighborhood. Thanks for adding value to our country's health care and insurance coverage.\"" - See more at: http://feedbackworks.com/referrals/2826/s#sthash.GTLh6zfD.dpuf"
1,"We were provided samples of several flavors of the house made gelato by the owner's husband.  Each was delicious and after much consideration we finally settled on a 2-scoop cup of tiramisu and ciccolate y peperoncino (chocolate and pepperoncini). The latter was slightly spicy, but it did not overwhelm the chocolate flavor.  I am certain future trips will include a return visit or two to field test a few more flavors."
0,"I don't eat pancakes or waffles, so if you're on the hunt for those items, disregard this review. \n\nHowever, if you eat eggs, there are better breakfast places in the Valley to go for breakfast. Trust me. \n\nThe last few times we visited Butters, I've made the mistake of ordering scrambled eggs. They literally looked like a scoop of wet, yellow poo. And I'm being nice here. \nThese so-called \""scrambled eggs\"" didn't look like real eggs at all, and because of the \""texture\""  and \""wetness\"" of them, I can't imagine what in the world I was eating (or trying to eat). I had them with one of their skillet breakfasts which had onions, bacon, mushrooms and potatoes, topped with this glop of yellow, wet \""stuff\"". \n\nAfter vomiting violently for over two hours, I've vowed never to return to try anything else at Butters, because seriously, there's way better places for breakfast that actually use eggs that have a yolk and egg white that is visible. \n\nThe only reason I\""m giving this place 2 stars is because, like I said, people say the pancakes are good, and I'll have to take their word for it. \n\nSorry, Butters, but Matt's Big Breakfast, The Original Pancake House, Snooze, Scramble and a host of other breakfast hot spots have you beat. By far..."
1,"I will be giving this place 5 stars for the food and the service as everything within the restaurant's control was perfect.  The food was perfect - portions were plentiful and very tasty .  They had that Coke machine where you customize your drink which I also thought was neat.  \n\nThe problem was that a basketball team with young kids was in there having a party of some sorts.  The restaurant's walls didn't help suppress the noise and it was very loud in there.  But this group got to be more and more out of control, that had I been the manager, I would've told them to cut it out.  McDonald's is down the road.  I can safely assume that the manager would've gotten in trouble by his higher-ups had he done such a thing.  \n\nI love Moe's and will come back, but I wish places would have a policy on controlling groups of kids.  Plus McDonald's is right up the road."
0,I really did not like this resturant. I went in the summer and they did not have an A/C. Most of their food is spicy so you will sweat like a pig. The food was not tasty at all. I have been to a lot of chinese resturants and this one is certanliy the worst. The soup smelled like a raw chicken which was  so discusting. Sorry but thisbis the truth.
0,"Na, ich wei\u00df nicht  dieses Outlet wirkt so gar nicht Premim und kann mit allen anderen amerikanischen Shopping-Paradiesen nicht mithalten.\nEs erinnert mich an die Great Mall nahe San Francisco. Auch hier ist das gesamte Center \u00fcberdacht und daher  Pluspunkt in Las Vegas  etwa auf Biofresh-Temperatur gek\u00fchlt.\nAber irgenwie ist alles chaotisch, auch gibt es viele un-Marken  alles in allem w\u00fcrde ich klar abraten und die anderen Malls und Outlets in Las Vegas empfehlen!"
0,"This is one of the smallest J Crew stores I've been to. They do not have men's clothes, and is limited in selection. Also, as mentioned by others, the staff is unfriendly and not helpful; after I was given a fitting room, there was no one available to get me another size in what I had tried on :("
0,"I'm going to do a 2 for 1 review. I went here last Friday for lunch and had the steak sandwich special and it was really good. So I thought why not go back today for lunch. I ordered the guacamole burger and my lunch date ordered the beef stew. First they served me a moldy piece of lettuce on the burger and the burger tasted like shit. Second the beef stew looked and was actually worse than dog food. The meat was so tough that when I tried it it took me at least a minute to swallow one piece. So I guess this place is gonna be one of those hit or miss type restaurants. If the food was more consistent I would probably eat here at least once a week, now I'll probably avoid Sierra Bonita like the plague. $40 for lunch and crap food is unacceptable!!!"
0,Hipster hangout. Flavorless food. Difficult parking. Expensive. Really? Really? Really?
0,"Glad I had a BOGO coupon, because this place sucks. I may slide in for happy hour at another time but there's better places for less at Westgate and Park West.  If you have to hit this chain, try 59th and Bell.\n\nTips:\n- Correct usage of past-tense in \""Steamed vegetables.\"" How long ago they were steamed is the question.\n- When did fish have a casing? Mahi Mahi dog ftw!\n- No refills for drinks so make it last."
1,"Been going to XS for three years now and I'm confident to say that this is one of the best clubs in the world. I've been all over the world and have partied in all the hot spots including Ibiza. Great layout, draws a classier and very HOT crowd. Plenty of room to dance and the night swims during pool season are EPIC. \n\nI just hope they revamp their dj residency. Avicii is old."
1,"Egg & I has become a recent tradition with the future in-laws.\n\nIt's a nice change-of-pace versus the Strip and a mere ten minute drive but not worth the added expense if you plan on cabbing.\n\nParking is plentiful and there is a delicious bakery with some of the stickiest baklavas in the same strip mall to warmup while you wait (ranging from 10 to 30 min).\n\nPrices are reasonable, service is shoddy, and luckily one cannot mess up eggs.  Food wasn't greasy for whatever's thats worth.\n\nAs you may have guessed menu is egg-centric but fear not.  I decided to change things up during my latest visit and ordered hawaiian food.  Yep, you read that right and my internal organs as of a week later remain intact.  They offer: loco moco, spam and eggs and portuguese sausage and eggs.  Ordered both the spam and portuguese sausage and had no regrets.  Forgot the name of the breakfast burrito with the chorizo but it was dense AF and subsequently awesome.\n\nTheir homefries are also a must."
1,"Love Pin Kaow.  We moved to California in 2009 and miss a good inexpensive Thai restaurant in the Murrieta area.  We visited Pin Kaow multiple times and never had a bad experience.  Pad Thai, crab rangoons, curry, sticky rice were our regular orders there and we always got the same, great, consistent food.  We were recommended to go there by friends and have sent many referrals there of our own."
1,"It's like a tiny part of my years in Japan, or a stolen Post Street Japantown shopping area from San Francisco!  A nice selection of fresh food, Japanese sweets and cooking reagents, as well as various home products.  Did I mention the fresh buns and breads and sushi?  Good!"
1,"Great place very hip, clean and nice decor.  Very nice people food is very healthy and good.  I would definitely refer it to friends."
1,"First impressions are the most important.\n\nI am so glad I stopped by this location. The lady that runs the front counter is so freaking funny.\n\nI didn't know what to order when I got there. I saw Italian sausage and I just went for it. \nIt comes with marinara sauce, onions, and bell peppers. \n\nThe subs are above average they definitely have a better taste and the onions were so freaking good. \n\nThe location is very clean attached to a 7-11."
1,The best Philly I've ever had and I am not a huge red meat fan.  The sandwiches are huge my 2 teenage boys have a hard time finishing these so who cares if they're a bit pricey.\nDang now I'm craving one!
1,"Gorgeous during the holidays. There is a massive Christmas tree in the lobby and tons of decor to match. This seems like a really old building but is extremely well kept. The staff are super friendly as most everyone is Pittsburgh seemed. I wish I could have stayed here a little longer but this was a stop on my way to new work. \n\nA solid 6 hour drive to NY,NY from here. Worth staying at."
0,"My partner and I were visiting my family in Pittsburgh we live in San Diego. my partner was born and raised in Portugal. My mom heard about this resaurant and was excited to take my partner and I to a Portuguese restaurant in Pittsburgh. We went, looked at the menu and did not find anything Portuguese on the menu. Why does this restaurant promote itself as Portuguese, fly the Portuguese flag and not have ANY Portuguese dishes. We left."
1,"Dried mango and chocolate covered Macadamia nuts... I just love that Vegas has ABC stores.  I stop into them occasionally to load up on tasty Hawaiian treats that are hard to find elsewhere.  \n\nI also dig their (sexy) calendars for only $2. \n\nThis location is big and spacious but a bit out of the way.  I was trying to waste time while waiting for a friend when I pulled in.  Normally though, it seems like it'd just serve the condo community around it.  Still, it's nice, clean, and have a few gambling machines (for you addicts).  Also, the guy working was really nice!\n\nMight see ya there!"
0,"No. Noooo thank you.\n\nMy friend ranted and raved about this place - it sounded good, close to work, and I was in the mood for some BBQ.\n\nI purchased a pulled chicken BBQ sandwich, side of mac and cheese, and.... waffle fries I think (obviously, unforgettable). Within the first bite of my chicken sammich, I found a chicken joint thing within the chicken.... There was only a bun, pulled chicken, and bone fragments (no additional toppings).  They did have a lot of different types of sauces and they were great (hence the two stars instead of one)!  The mac and cheese was super bland and mushy.\n\nThe actual restaurant is near deer valley airport, in an office plaza, and has an industrial feel to the inside.\n\nIf you really like BBQ, check it out, but check the food before you take your first bite!"
1,"This Get-Go is really good. Average number of pumps, good selection inside, right up Cochran from Giant Eagle itself, and you get Grocery Points for pumping here instead of next door at Sunoco. The cahiers inside are always really nice."

0,"Rented a minivan for a week online for $470. At pickup they tried every bait-and-switch and salesman trick in the book to increase the cost. They first claimed they had a Kia reserved for me (apparently because many people hate Kias and are willing to pay to upgrade) and I had to say \""no thank you\"" to upgrade requests about 6 times before they finally admitted they didn't actually have a Kia for me anyway but rather a Dodge Caravan. They initially charged me for extra insurance even though I said \""no\"" (be careful not to say \""basic\"" - that means the \""basic\"" level of extra insurance). The pickup was time consuming because of all of their tactics. They quoted me a higher price for adding an extra driver than what was stated on the Budget website. After finally rejecting all of the extras, they gave me a bill for $540, which I had to insist be recomputed because I would not pay more than the $470 I had been quoted online.\n\nThe vehicle I received was nice and clean but not well maintained. The windshield wipers were shot and the wheels were not well balanced (the steering wheel shook at highway speeds).\n\nI would rather pay a higher price elsewhere and not have to feel like I am defending myself against attempted scams."
1,Delicious food. I usually get the chicken  tikka masala with plain naan. Clean and casual. Small  quaint place to eat. Friendly staff. Good service.
1,"I love you Cheba, I want to make love to you like when Kumar made love to that giant ass bag of weed in Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle. Anyway to get away from that, I love my Griefo with its pepper jack, hemp cream cheese, guacamole, sprouts, lettuce, black olives, onions, mushrooms, cucumbers, pickles, & tomatoes. You can really taste that tasty hemp. Bonus to some of the cute, white guys working there. However, the guy working the register was irritatingly slow. Like snail slow, taking forever to complete an order. It made me wonder what was making him so relaxed..."
1,Stumbled upon this place through Yelp reviews. Hard to identify My Key Coffee if you didn't know it was inside the cookie place--but so worth the search! Awesome iced toddy and ice tea. Can't wait to go back. I think I've found my summer spot
1,"Very nice location with really nice employees and very good, fresh produce.  You can't beat the weekly deals and the gluten free selection is quite wonderful.  I can shop gluten free and vegetarian for my daughter with ease here."
1,"Beer and brisket.  What more can I say?  Went based on recommendation of a friend.   I can't tell you how many times I've driven past this place on the way to the Waterfront and always wondered.  I'm glad I went!  We both loved the brisket and the beer selection was excellent.  Server was super nice, and the environment was very laid back bar environment.  Not too loud/rowdy and not too quiet.  \n\nThe salsa had more garlic than I have ever eaten in a single sitting, which may be my only food-related complaint, but it was freshly made so I'm going to attribute it to single batch mistake.  Check this place out!"
1,"I love the new location. I know, I know, everyone has been talking about it for years. I live in the 'hood, and didn't much like the old location. Walking into a cafe, only to see a sea of laptops, isn't very welcoming. Not their fault, of course.\n\nThe new location offers up some tasty treats. I've had a few of the breakfast and lunch items. \n\nIt can be a bit confusing to find it at first. You have to go in the back door. (Hahahahaha you know what *I* am thinking, right?) Picking up your order is tricky, because it gets loud in there and you may not hear your name called.\n\nI prefer the back (front) room. Less traffic, and there's a cool bar to sit at."
1,Had a small wedding July 5th. Our wedding coordinator Arriel was amazing!  Friends and family commented it was the best wedding they have been too.
0,"The hotel receives 3 stars, but due to a horrible valet, a star gets knocked off.  The hotel is modern and clean, no frills but affordable.  They offer muffins and coffee for breakfast.  The staff is pleasant and the decor is very interesting.  The shower design is pretty neat.  We chose to use the hotel valet, with unlimited access to your car.  Overall it is fine, it can take about a half hour to get your car, so plan ahead.  The day that we left, the valet must not have known how to drive a manual, as we discovered a horrible burning smell after we drove off.  After taking it to the Volkswagen nearby, it was confirmed that the clutch had been burnt.  We called the hotel, but had a difficult time finding and getting a hold of the manager for resolution of the issue."
1,"FIRST TIME TRYING.\n\nI went through the drive through.\nBest customer service.\nI'm usually hard on drive through because usual drive through employees are lousy and  a bit prude, but NOT FREDDYS.\n\nFast and 100% customer service even through drive through.\n\nEXPERIENCE:\n\nDrove up and was greeted right away with a friendly and welcoming voice.\n\nI told the girl that it's my first time and I asked her which was better, the number 1 or number 7?

It's a basic nice resaurant with linens on the table.  None of the Vegas hoopla.  \n\nFrom start to finish this was a fantasitic dining experience!  The waitress was excellent...SHE WAS FUNNY AS HELL AND SHE LOOKS LIKE ELLEN DEGENERES!  Even the other waiters are funny! We ordered the Petite Filet Mignon and Lobster for 2 for 87 dollars.  What a deal!!!!  It comes with 2 salad, 2 sides, and 2 deserts!  THE FOOD AT THIS DAMN PLACE IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FREAKIN GOOOOODDDDDD!!!  The steak was so tender and perfect.  The lobster was good as well but not the best I've had.  By the time desert came we were too full to eat it! It was chocolate molten cake with fresh strawberries.  I wanted to eat it I just didnt have the space for it.  \n\nIf you are in the Forum Shops and in the mood for pampering, GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!  5 STAR SERVICE!!!  i know i keep saying that....BUT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT!

The shredded lettuce. The perfectly round and red slices of tomato...Damn it I can't get to Vegas quick enough now! \n\nI would give a limb  to have a JJ's in Los Angeles.

1,Nice to have walking distance from home.
0,"Food was not good. Wife said the chicken tacos tasted horrible. Cheese enchilada tasted like dirt. The bean burrito was ok but I had them add sour cream and guacamole.  The prices were way too high for this low quality of food. I should have known better than to eat here when i saw they don't accept credit cards.  When an owner is too cheap to pay visa/MasterCard 2% of a transaction, you know they are going to be cheap with the food quality too."
1,Great food. A little pricey but very tasty. I kinda wish I didn't have to order a huge side dish to share because it was a little too much but overall a very nice experience.
1,"This is a nice place to go.  I was here around 3 en la manana, was the only party there.  Everything was clean.  \n\nThey are cash only.\n\nFrom what I remember the carne asada fries were very very large.  They don't come with salsa, which I guess is common for non Los Angeles mexican restaurants from which I order carne fries from, but nevertheless you can add from salsa bar.  Comes with fries carne asada, cheese, gwak, sour cream, and a hint of refried beans (those are the mashed ones, not the whole beans).  \n\nThe rest of my party ordered: taco, tostada, and chimichanga.  All of these looked delicious as well.  Too bad I didn't get a bite.\n\n\nAlso tried the lingua tacos (cow tongue) that I did not order but was offered a bite.  They were pretty decent, for being tongue and for never trying them before.  Had the texture of soft beef brisket and tofu, but tasted like turkey.    \n\nIf you feed them to you cat you can say, \""Cat got your tongue?\"""
0,The food is pretty decent  but the multiple times I've been in there the staff have hadhorrible attitudes. The food isn't worth it when you get treated like you are bothering the staff each time you order food

Our waiter was covering too many tables and could not manage all of them (e.g. I asked for a second glass of wine with dinner and was brought the menu half way through my entree). \n\nManagement take note. The food is average at best and the menu predictable. Montreal is supposed to be one of the best \""culinary cities\"" in North America. Either fire your manager or get a new chef because mediocre food and sloppy service is a recipe for unhappy foodies. I really wanted to love this restaurant but even duck fat fries can't save this one."
0,"One of the rare times Yelp reviews completely mislead us! Key reasons for this EPIC FAIL for Valentine's Dinner. 1. Food was not worth the price. 2. Server failed to disclose the very expensive price of a bottle of wine that was not listed on the menu 3. Service was slow 4. Ambiance was unusual\n\nMy husband and I went to Quiessence for Valentine's on Thursday the 13th and ordered the prefix menu for $80 per person. I waited at the table by myself for the first hour because my husband was coming straight from the airport and his flight was unexpectedly delayed. I didn't mind this at all especially because I could catch up on some emails while enjoying some much needed wine and quiet time (3 babies at home - don't get out much=). I asked the server a few questions about what she recommended for sweet wines and she suggested a bottle that was normally a special and not listed on the menu. I liked it a lot and the manager approved the sale however she did not tell me the price. I didn't ask because of all the sweet wines we were considering the most expensive one was about $48/bottle. I wouldn't assume that the bottle I got would be much more and if so, the server would tell me. Um no! It was $77!!!!! I was so frustrated and over this place when I got the bill, I just paid it and left as soon as I could. \n\nRegarding the food; it was a 4 course meal, all of which was mediocre. The appetizer of prosciutto and brie was good but small and must of had a food cost of cents! The soup and salad was the same level of quality (squash soup and kale salad). Nothing special. The pork shank entree was the best part of the meal but not worth $80 to have 1 good dish of 7. The salmon was small and bland. Again nothing to write home about. The dessert was a variety of different sweets, all of which were frozen. Talk about mass produced and definitely not made to order. We also didn't get the bread until after our soup/salad which we must of asked for 3 times. (Sidenote: it would of been nice of her to also offer bread while I was waiting for my husband).\n\nWith a bill of $310 I wish we would of stuck to our normal ruth's chris or capital grille. Never ever will I go to Quiessence again or recommend it. This is sad to me because my husband and I work in an industry where we host high profile clients for lunch and dinner on a daily basis and finding gems in Phoenix is rare. \n\nRegarding ambiance; I used to live in Japan and it reminded me a lot of old alley restaurants you find there where people turn old houses into restaurants. We were sitting on a patio in the corner with an old school window AC unit and dirt backyard. So weird and definitely not romantic."
0,"Really its a 2 1/2 just not deserving enough of a 3\n\nThe good: \n\nThe place itself is pretty rad and eccentric!\nThe lemonade is soo yumny and perfect on a hot summer day! \nThe sliders are tasty and flavors are inviting. \nFamily friendly.\n\nThe bad:\n\nMy chips were completely burnt and i mean they looked more like charcoal than sweet potato chips. \nI took them back and was promised a new set, which i never got so i pretty much gave away my money. \nThat alone threw me off. \nThe cups offered  for water were dirty.\nthe water was hot. for their prices atleast some ice and lemon wedges would be nice.\n\nCustomer service was ok other than not bringing me my darn chips. \n\nI would go give it another try for the heck of the sliders and lemonades but it will be a while."
1,"I called from clear across the country to request an order be delivered to my ill daughter who lives within their delivery circle. Renee was wonderful on the phone informing me of their menu. I had bowls of chicken soup, salad, fresh fruit and a sandwich sent..... My girl was really surprised and said a LOT of food arrived.  Thank you so much for the good service and delivery."
0,Went with 4 friends.  After we were done we bet how long this place would be open?   All our food came at once.  So the appetizer and our soup got pushed aside. The staff was very dumb and didn't care how long empty plates and bowls stacked up.  I give the food 4 out of 10....  Go home hungry or just hit Millers or the Yardhouse!!!!
1,"O-M-G! I must've died and gone to heaven! This place was absolutely spectacular! I admit it took about 20 mins to get but the line moved pretty fast and I was drunk so I wasn't complaining. This place had some of EVERYTHING. I couldnt make it to dessert because I had filled up on everything else. They had things like duck, pizza, wings, Chinese food,  CRAB LEGS, and about a thousand other things. Everything seemed so clean and the staff were also very friendly. This wasnt her neighborhood Home Town Buffet. This is the ultimate buffet. I enjoyed my experience here and so did my boyfriend. The options seems endless. I would return here with friends and family."
1,Fantastic. Shrimp creole was great. So was the chicken and sausage gumbo. I will be coming back.
1,"Two words:  STEAK FRIES\n\nI'll add a little more.  It was a little chilly in there but it's pretty small and with the cold weather one open of the door and it's winter inside.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try some other items on their menu, but the steak fries....yummy!"
0,"Unfriendly staff and horrible sweet Mexican food. Ordered a green chile burrito but tasted so sweet, thought I was having dessert. Won't go back."
0,"Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nGood and cheap Mexican food absolutely must be inclusive in order to work.  Here it's just barely.  Saying that, I still decided to go more than once.\n\nFirst go was on a weekend when they make Menudo.  This is a dish that will usually either scare me from future visits or endear the place to me.  For the first time ever: all I could say about it was, \""meh.\""  Apparently there is a variation of Menudo that's neither great nor horrible.  The tripe was tender and for the most part trimmed well.  The broth was definitely lacking some flavor, but not that a few additions didn't remedy it sufficiently.  My biggest issue was that probably a good third of my order was taken up by one of their stewing bones that just happened to get scooped in there.  It can happen, but this one was too big to be entirely negligence.\n\nSecond go involved two tacos.  I like to pit a place's carnitas versus adobada to see which one I prefer of theirs.  For the record, their adobada won this battle.  Really, in my experience, I haven't seen many places with the skill to screw up either of these.  Both were quite tastey, but the portions I'm used to were slightly lacking.  I guess I've been spoiled by places that have made me wonder if there was a tortilla under there.  They didn't just skimp on the meat though, but also the toppings.  Just a smidge of pico de gallo and a dollop of guacamole that wouldn't take me too much convincing that they bought from a supermarket.  Still I will point out that both the carnitas and adobada were well prepared and full of the right flavors.\n\nA special note will go to their pickled carrots, onions, and jalapenos.  It's pretty difficult for a condiment to catch my attention, and truth be told, I almost missed out.  On my first visit, someone, noticing my initial indecisiveness on the menu, deduced that I had never tried them and recommended them heartily.  The fact that they provide sandwich bags to be able to take some home means that it's no secret the stuff is good.  Cooked just to the right amount to have both some caramelization and crunch.  Spiced and pickled to be tangy without an overbearing heat.\n\nAn all latino and friendly staff -- which is a must in my book.  English isn't the best, and something tells me even a little Spanish will get you a tad better service.  Either way, it's all pretty decent."
1,"We went to see Croods today in one of the new digital theater rooms.  WOW!  I couldn't believe the huge improvement.  \n\nI've never complained about picture quality at this theater - I figure that the low cost of the movie doesn't justify a complaint.  This new system rocks!  Such a great picture and the sound was really good too!  \n\nGreat addition to your theater Pollack!  Thanks so much! \n\nOH, and they now take CREDIT CARDS!"
0,"Urgh. Douchebag bouncer(s). It was the second last night I and a few friends would be in Montreal, and we made the mistake of wasting our time with this place. My friend registered for the guestlist that would ensure we could get in with no cover, which was awesome. Unfortunately, the bouncer was a total tool. Sensing we were newbies, he wouldn't let us in unless we paid the cover, EVEN THOUGH HE FOUND US ON THE LIST. We weren't terribly under-dressed, drunk, or rude, yet both he and the woman inside tried to scam us into paying as much as we could to party in their generic club. No thanks."
1,"The latest gem to grace Downtown is located at 6th & Carson. Bocho Sushi was born from an idea sparked by Dan Coughlin (Le Thai), backed by DTP and saw to fruition by Jimmy & Becky Chun (recently shuttered Tokyo Japanese Restaurant). The Chun's are at the helm, they are no strangers to day-to-day operations after running their restaurant in Commercial Center for decades. At two weeks new, Bocho Sushi has already reached hotspot status by serving up some delicious eats in a cozy setting. \n\nOur friends invited us to dinner, upon our arrival, every seat in the house was taken. Downstairs you'll find the sushi bar with counter seating, and upstairs there is intimate seating and large bar. The space has an industrial feel, but I love when old buildings are spruced up and repurposed. The changes to the old Carson hotel have been top notch. This block was once forgotten, but now? It's alive and well. \n\nThe menu will meet all of your sushi and sashimi loving needs. Plus, there is an omakase offering for those seeking an adventurous experience. Sake, beer and cocktails are free flowing. They have not yet begun serving wine, however. We started with orders of Edamame ($3.50) and the Jalapeno Bomb ($5.95). The bomb was \""bomb\"" (har), seriously, though, it was delicious. It is hard to go wrong with deep fried jalapeno with spicy tuna and cream cheese. Unfortunately, the Edamame was late to show. It served as dessert. \n\nA smorgasbord of rolls and sashimi followed: Yellowtail Lover ($9.95), Tiger Roll ($11.95), China Roll ($11.95), Spider Crab Roll ($12.95), Yellowtail Yuzu Ceviche ($11.99), Salmon Sashimi ($6.25). The were all well executed. The fish was delicately sliced and extremely fresh. My personal favorites were the Yellowtail Yuzu Ceviche with serranos and spicy garlic ponzu, and the China Roll with shrimp tempura and spicy tuna. Both selections were bursting with flavor. \n\nThe staff was warm and friendly and our servers were patient & attentive, the only flaw seems to be with timing. I'm confident that they will get that resolved in time. It always takes a new restaurant a bit to find their rhythm. Bocho is currently open for dinner, but lunch service is scheduled to begin next week."
0,"I took takeout so my review will be somewhat limited. \n\nFirst impression ... you come in and the place looks tired. Not bad, but kind of like \""I wish you would go away so I can rest\"" tired. \nWouldn't want to actually eat there, but for the 10 minutes it took it was ok. Didn't try Mongolian but it looked ok.\n\nCan't beat the takeout. $6.99 (takeout or reinstated price?) for a 3 section styrofoam box that you can fill to your little heart's content. As long as the lid can close comfortably ... there is a sign to this effect.\n\nThe buffet was average. I stuck to the appetizer-type stuff and filled it up. Ultimately it was enough for 2 or 3 meals. Not bad for a set price. However, if you're craving quality Chinese, this is not it. Not by a long shot. Good for a day when you're not picky about taste (not bad, mind you) or content.\n\nTakeout also came with a container for soup. The hot and sour did look awesome, with large chunks of tofu, and it was one of the better ones I have tried. Upon request, the attendant also filled a large bag of crispy noodles for me to take along. They did have little cups for sauces, but the hot mustard looked plastic and congealed. Scary to eat, scary to taste so I left it there. And there was no plum sauce to mix it with.  \n\nI was surprised that they didn't have a regular menu also, but all buffet, all the time ... \n\nwill I go again ? one of life's questions, yet to be answered. And asked ..."
0,"We had breakfast this morning here. We waited 45 minutes for our breakfasts.   Unfortunately, the servers were less than attentive and we waited almost 30 minutes for a refill of our coffee.  The food was good but the negative experience of the extreme  delay and little concern for us while waiting is all I can remember.  We will not go back."
0,"We went for breakfast last Sunday.  Trying to hit up some local downtown places.\n\nWe sat outside and I ordered an iced coffe.  The coffee was good, not bitter which was a nice surprise.\n\nWe both ordered The Bird Omelette, with no cheese and asked for a side of pico.  So our food comes out and there is no pico. Someone forgot to make it... ummm ok.  The replacement was pace picante salsa... which IMO is not salsa and should not be served at restaurants.\n\nThe omelette was just ok.  It literally was huge... like 4 egg and over cooked.  The eggs were rubery and the turkey was dry, I thought it was a cracker no joke.  After a few minutes our server brings out a side of pico which helped tremendously.  It was very fresh and nice flavor.\n\nWe get the check and I am ready to pay when I see that they charged me for the pico?!?! Umm... excuse me but I just ordered two omelettes with no cheese... I think that would have given me a pass on the charge for the pico.. which I think was $2 it was good but not that good.\n\nI hate places that nickle and dime you to death... so unfortunately even though we can walk there from our condo we wont be back. \n\nThe two stars are for the atmosphere, the coffee and the potatoes.\n\nAnother disappointing downtown eatery :/"
0,"Had dinner there Sunday evening.  I have been in the valley 12 years, and this is the worst food that I have ever been served.  A piece of veal that was most  likely left over from Friday or Satuday night.  They probably put it in the microwave.  It could not be cut with a knife, dried out, a grease ball.  They should not serve dreck like that, and charge you for it.  The waiter looked, as far as clean hands, like he just finished doing the yard work there.  A shame that we wasted so much money on a horrible dinner.  Even the pasta they served on the side was total grease.  They took away the large salad we ordered that was half eaten without even asking.   That was rude.\n\nI realize it was a Sunday evening, but, please, do not serve such inferior food, and please wear a clean outfit if you are going to serve the public food.  I will never go back there, and will let my friends know what a horrible experience we had."
0,"These two stars are basically for ambiance and fantastic food.  Service is average at best, pool is free but the only thing more broken than the pool sticks is the pool tables themselves.  The beer selection is the worst for someone who values good beer, thank you but if my elite choice is a magic hat #9...  Even being with in walking distance to my house and the choice for my gambling induced friends, I would never go here and rarely do."
0,"The customer service here is not that bad. The coffee on the other hand is lacking in quality. Actually, it's some of the worst coffee I've ever had. Some of the sandwich options are tolerable , but it's a coffee shop... and the coffee is awful. Also,  there is a fee to use your card if under 5 dollars. Pfft"
1,"Located inside Planet Hollywood.\n\nSeriously, THE BEST sandwiches ever at really reasonable prices!!  The toasted bread is AMAZING - crunchy and warm on the outside and super soft on the inside.  It also holds up all the ingredients really well.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of their sandwiches. \n\nWe shared:\nThe Full Montagu - roast beef, turkey, two cheeses (aged swiss and sharp cheddar), lettuce, tomato, and house mustard\nThe Italian - salami, capicola, roasted ham, mortadella, and zesty italian dressing\nMediterranean Chicken Salad - super fresh, and the chicken was really tender!  \n\nI can't even tell you which sandwich I liked better because they were both good in their own right.  \n\nThey're open 24 hours so eat here for dinner, go gamble, then come back and eat some more.  LOVE this place!!  So happy one recently opened in Socal in Downtown Disney, so now I can get my fix whenever I'm in the mood."
0,"You would think that Greek food would be a natural for casual, take out places.  You can make a lot of the food ahead.  It is good served cold.  Much of it is finger food.  Yet, with the possible exception of some places in Chicago, most of the Greek take out places I have been to are subpar.  Crazy Pita is no exception to this rule.  We ordered a falafel sandwich, a shrimp skewer, and a mezza plate (feta, hummus, artichoke hearts, cucumber salad, and roasted peppers) to share.  As I expected, the shrimp was tough and was sitting on some watery vegetables and undercooked couscous.  But it was the hummus that surprised us the most -- thin, drippy, and tasteless.  The pita served with it was dry.  The roasted peppers had no flavor or texture.  The best things were the cucumber salad and the falafel.  Now I have had better falafel, plumper and spicier, but this at least was crisp, moderately spicy and did not fall apart.  I could only compare this to the delicious hummus, gyros, and stuffed eggplant we had at Max's Greek Cafe in the San Francisco airport.  If you can't serve better food than an airport cafe, then you can't expect to stay in business for very long."
0,"I just got home from this SuperPawn location. This was my dilemma, I called the store earlier today and informed the person on the phone that I was 9 days late making my payment on important pieces of jewelry that I had a loan on. The nice man informed me that I needed to come in the store just so they could verify that I was the owner and they would try to have the items sent back to the store. I didn't know why they were sent out? He said one of the pieces needed to get fixed. I still didn't know why they sent out both pieces? but ok. After work today I went over to show proof that I was the owner, this is what happened. I walked in and stood in front of the counter, I was called over by a nice young man with spiked dark hair, I informed him of the situation regarding the items of jewelry and how I would really like to get the pieces back. He then looked toward the man standing behind him who was Jason Arther the store manager. The store manager Jason Arther did not look at me, would not even say hello to me and he is waring some kind of star employee performance badge on his shirt. He told me straight out we can't guarantee your items will get back to you. He said we put the request in and we will see if they come back. I said oh ok, do you guys just enter it in the computer hear at the store? Would the items to come back automatically or do you call some ware and have them shipped back, he the interrupted me and said I don't even know ware the stuff is at! We will just have to see. Then I said oh, ok so do you guys just call me or????? I then said do I call you? Right then the nice young man I was dealing with earlier said \""you can give us a call in a couple of days if you don't hear from us. Right then he was cut off by the store manager Jason Arthur who said NO! Just call us in 2 weeks if you don't hear from us. I am thinking this guy seams to just want me to leave the SuperPawn Store. I really don't think Store Manager Jason Arthur cares about my 2 little items. His attitude seamed to show me he just wanted me gone. I hope I'm wrong and I do get the items back, because they mean a lot to me. I will update this review in 2 weeks after I see how the SuperPawn in Henderson, NV. Next to the Home Depot store under the leadership of store manager Jason Arthur responds. I really hope they are able to locate my items."
1,"I come here everytime I visit Vegas. I shop here with my daughter :) We just like to stroll around and look for whatever catches our eyes, or whatever we are in the mood for. Sometimes they have great clearance items which I am always on the lookout for. Some things can be a bit pricy and the employes are always pleasant. They are well stocked on most items and the store is always clean and organized :)"
0,"Ok, the novelty of this place is that it is a locally owned business, yada yada yada. I give credit where credit is due, and support many locally owned businesses, but this won't be one of them. There is nothing unique about this place. It is some rich kid who decided to sell/rent his personal collection of movies. He kept bragging across the store to his girlfriend (since my friend and i were the only the people in the store) about how he went down to Blockbuster and picked the employees brain about their prices/strategies. Oh yeah, excellent idea. Let's take pointers from a franchise that is going down faster than a two cent hooker. The movie selection was weak, and most of the niche \""cult\"" movies they had were available on Netflix instant stream. Not only that, but he (the owner in sweat pants because he's too cool) never asked if we needed any help and was too busy bragging about uncovering Blockbuster's secrets. He also talked to some man on the phone and after hanging up the phone spoke condescendingly of the guy on the phone, but said something to the effect of \""I don't know, but we just made $15 off him\"".  \nEverything in this place screams spoiled rich brat who has brought a dying concept of owning a video store thinking he is a special little snowflake. The candy? Barrels of crap like lemon heads, tootsie rolls, and variation of other junky candy you find in those generic bags of candy when you click yes to add candy to the flowers you're ordering for someone.  I asked his girlfriend who was ringing out my friend (who after a long search found 3 movies to buy for $10) about the candy they had behind the counter. She seemed uninterested to elaborate on any of it. There is nothing unique or original about this store or its cocky owner.\nI can see this being unique for those who've never heard of Netflix streaming or Redbox. Hell, I'd even rather give Blockbuster my business."
1,"Ok, so I've probably been to this restaurant more than any other place in Phoenix.  Every time its truly a great experience.\n\nRoasted Corn Pizza absolutely rules!\n\nMake sure you go next door, pick out a bottle of wine (very reasonable prices and no corkage fee next door) and buy some English Muffins for later.\n\nWhen you're done wash it down with some truly awesome gelato."
0,"Wow, I never would have expected a hotel this dirty and unsanitary. I am not one to be picky when getting a cheap hotel, but holy smokes was this place nasty. The shower was clogged, the bathroom had hair all over it by the bunches, the kitchen was not cleaned, the bed had stains all over it. The television didn't get every channel and the homeless people didn't help. I'm just stunned at such filth. Please do follow my advice and avoid this dump. It was straight out of a movie"
0,I took the family for Easter dinner and was very disappointed!  The service was very slow and somewhat rude. I had a chicken parm and it was very mediocre. The chicken breast was over-breaded and very thin and the pasta was so over cooked it was one big lump.  Other reviews talk of the big map\nbut when they seat you in the back next to the kitchen you aren't so impressed.  Of all the places in Vegas I have been this one is on the bottom of the list.
1,"I've been ordering Chinese delivery from a different local restaurant for a while now. No need to name names. I ordered tonight from Bamboo China, and it was very good. The pot stickers are as good as you will find anywhere. Everything arrived well packaged and hot. I had the General Tao's chicken. It was very tasty and not too sweet. I also had the Ma Pao Tofu in garlic sauce. Very nice. The hot and sour soup could use a little more \""sour\"" and a shrimp or two wouldn't hurt. That said, the black pepper level is perfect. Loved it. Will definitely be ordering again."
1,"My family and I love this place. Food is is really tasty!  It's our favorite Thai restaurant to go to.  We've brought friends and family here and they too love it!    Highly recommend Larb, Tom Kha (shrimp), Beef Panang, and Thai Tea with cream!"
1,"Been to the Scottsdale Topgolf twice - once with the guys, once with a big group of family in town over Thanksgiving holiday - and had a total blast each time! What a brilliant concept - turning a driving range into a full entertainment, food and drinks venue.\n\nIt's a little pricey, but not terribly. First time I went was on a Thursday night and the place was totally packed. There are 3 levels of bays and the top (3rd) always seems to be occupied by a large corporate group - which this place is ideal for. We waited awhile, had some drinks & food, then got a bay on level 2 (the higher up you are, the better).\n\nGolfers or non-golfers will both have fun as they've created scoring games with multiple targets, and many levels of them. Bring your own clubs or use the house clubs, it's your preference. Even if you've never picked up a club, you'll have a ton of fun at this place."
1,"Great food. Everytime I have been hear I have really enjoyed it. Great food pairings. It is expensive but there are some reasonable options next to the 30 dollar fish.  \n\nI have made it out for my last two birthdays in Madison. My father ate the rainbow trout here a year or so ago and said it was the second best meal he has ever eaten, the first being the space needle."
0,"The food was okay, the chicken parmigiana was decent, but not worth a return trip.  The sauce on the pasta tasted like chef boyardee.  Over all not impressed and I won't be trying it again."
0,"Was there with a party of 8, 4adults 4kids nice atmosphere and clean from the entrance to the washrooms. Food was average for the price although the salad they include with the meal was awful soggy oil drenched lettuce, the worst part was the souvlaki plate (at a Greek restaurant). The meat was dry and burnt the pita was overfilled with tzatziki, the tomatoes in the pita were cut in huge quarters like in a Greek salad, lazy lazy . The lamb chops were tasty but again overcooked, the rib steak was worth the price but again overcooked not to or request. Certainly a rotisserie can get one meat cooked to request. As for the rest of the appetizers the spinach pie was great, the fried zucchini and eggplant was tasteless, not impressed for a place I heard so much about. I would be weary of giving this place another chance, but because I've heard many recommendations I probably will, maybe on a slower night."
0,"If you want to buy the \""cleanse\"" , it is hit and miss if they have it in the store.  There is a group of us wanted to do it together.  This store told us to order online and they will be delivered to the store without a shipping charge.  Called their main office and was told they cannot deliver to this store.  There is a $20 shipping fee per cleanse.   I will go elsewhere now, across the street to Juby Juice for me."
1,"Phoenix needs Mary Coyle and Sugar Bowl because, if anything, they serve as a tasty time capsule to another time.  It also helps that Mary makes the best raspberry shakes this side of Bear Lake, Utah."

0,"One of the worse experiences I've had at Bath and Body Works. First of all, the store reeked of their new fragrance when I walked through the doors. I was in the store for five minutes and my clothes lingered with that scent. In addition, the scent was so strong that I got a headache. Ouch.\n\nYeah, I like Bath and Body Works stores, but there was  way too much body spray or perfume around that entrance door!\n\nI still like the Mango Mandarin and the Pumpkin lotions at Bath and Body Works."
0,"Just way to expensive for what it is. It's good but not at the prices they choose. $9 for wedding soup? It was good, but not at that price and if I would've been told it was that much (was a special) I would've passed. Service was fine, but not attentive and slow, as well. Just so many other good Italian places in the area for half the price. Eggplant parm was enjoyable."
0,"Very disappointed. Upon recommendation from someone else, I placed an order to rent a GPS for an international trip two weeks ahead of time. I received an email that the order was received and that I would get a tracking number as soon as it was shipped. Unfortunately, when they never happened I called. Had to leave a message but no one called back. I called again only to find out that they were out of the product but had never bothered to tell me. Had I known sooner, I could have gotten one from someone else. As it is, I'm basically out of luck. I was told to use my phone. Definitely not happy with this very poor service."
0,"Came here for the first time since they closed down the branch in LA and this is not a restaurant I'll miss.  We came for brunch and while they have a decent spread but this is just another upscale chain restaurant.  The service was hit or miss. It started off great but once we got our food we had to keep asking to get refills, to add another order and for the bill.  \n\nI think this would have been at least a 3-4 star restaurant if I ordered something else.  Both my friend and I got the corned beef hash which we did not like.  We both had the same complaint that the meat was dry so and with a bit of potatoes mixed in.  The dish was just so off balance with the lack of potatoes.  Both of our eggs were also overcooked.  The hash browns were decent.\n\nThe best part of my meal was the OJ which for the price they charge it better be good."
1,Food: good! Chicken and waffles and potatoes. Great portions and decent prices. \n\nService: good for as busy as they are. \n\nAtmosphere: looks good but it is soooooo busy all the time and the wait sucks!!!\n\nWe love this place but you have to be patient. Expect a 45 minute wait.
1,"First, our server, A.J.,  was top notch and was a major reason for our group of golf buddies enjoying a great evening at CPH. He had knowledge of the food and great personality.  The cocktails and food were delicious.  The only negative comments I can say is that the crab cakes need a little work. But the chopped salad, the burrata, the short rib, the scallops, and the meatloaf were fantastic.\nGreat restaurant with lots of energy."
0,"The food here is poor. Very poor. The food is also very pricey, adding to the dissappointment. I am only giving it two stars because of the nice ambiance and the friendly staff. I wish I would have looked into this place before I went and I would have stayed away. Please avoid this restaurant."
1,"Ok everyone was right.\nThis place is freaking awesome!\n\nThe VARIETY! WOW~! Totally worth for what I paid for!\nThe seafood part was the best! The shrimp were jumbo size and fresh, including the juicy half shell oysters! Could't get enough of it!\n\nI love how they had Korean Kalbi, it was extremely tendered. The sushi was pretty good, and ginseng chicken soup was legit! Tasted like my grandmothers cooking! The macaroons...wow where do I start! The quality of those deserts were way better than some of the bakeries I've been to. I've tried the Ramen & the Udon and they were both pretty good as well.\n\nBut the seafood man... that was the best thing at the buffet~"
0,"I received a PJ set as a gift from my Mom for Christmas. She paid $19.20 for the top and $19.20 for the pants which = $38.40 total.  Unfortunately, they were too big, so I had to return them for store credit. Upon doing so, I was told that the items were now on sale, and that they would only refund me the sale price, which was $14.39 per piece, plus they were deducting the $10.00 Kohl's bucks that she received for the purchase. So, my Mom paid $38.40 for the PJ's and because they did not fit and I had to return them, I was given $20.05.  \nThe Kohl's cash I almost get, but not refunding the original price paid for the items is bull! But the taking the Kohl's cash promo away from the gift receiver is crap as well. It's a promotion the store is doing and as it turns out, it's just a big money maker.   I will never shop at Kohl's again, and I will ask my friends to do the same. Especially if for a gift. Not a happy customer. Goodbye Kohl's"
0,"We were a party of six and ordered 9 items altogether And the food was good. But it took 2 hours from being seated to getting the bill. One hour before our main dishes appeared. We had to remind the waiter twice about the desserts.\nWe were seated upstairs, which perhaps slows things down. But this place is not cheap and two hours for a Chinese dinner is absurd."
0,I avoid this place!  They play extrememly loud music on Saturday nights till 2am. I will not go there until they change their practices.
1,I love this place! It's walking distance from my office that service delicious fast food.\n\nIt's a great place to grab a quick freshly made breakfast burrito or sandwich.\n\nThe lunch is very good too! They have a daily special that includes a side and a drink and they have good homemade type sandwiches. My personal favorites are the Korean BBQ Sandwich and they make an awesome tuna salad sandwich!\n\nTell them I sent ya!
0,"I agree with everyone that gave this place 1 star. We used them at the end of April while visiting Phoenix and didn't have any problems so we decided to use them again last week. \n\nWe were only going to be in town for 2 days so the estimated cost was $160 for a mid size. When we get to the rental desk the agent tries to upsell us on a convertible. It's mid August in PHOENIX, ARIZONA and he wants us to drive off in a freaking convertible. So after he adds me as a driver and tacks on the insurance the total comes to $391!!!!!!!!!! A mid size car for 2 days and you're going to charge us $391!!!!!!! We asked what time do we need to return the car on Thursday before being charged an extra day. He seemed bothered, but he said 12:45. We also went with the basic insurance.\n\n We returned the car at 12:40 with a full tank of gas. Our total was $191.00\n\nIf after reading this review and all the other negative reviews you still decide to rent from Thrifty, read the fine print and have the agent explain to you what you are being charged and why."
0,"It'll do in a pinch.  \n\nI was here a few weeks ago for a conference and was happy in the beginning to be staying in a giant pyramid.  I was a little underwhelmed by all the dinge.   Also a little creeped out by \""Carrot Top\"" constantly being portrayed as a sex symbol.   It took me about a day and a half to figure out there was supposed to be an Egyptian theme.    But, hey it's Vegas, and you didn't really come to stay in a room the whole time.   So have to give it some credit for being affordable.   \n\nWhat i didn't like aside from the dinge, was all the nickle and diming on the way out.  A mandatory hotel charge for water and newspapers, which I didn't know we were entitled to, when I say that I didn't utilize those services the person at the front desk pointed to a stack of newspapers...oh well now I understand...that's got to be worth fifteen dollars a day.   \n\nAll and all - you want to store all your stuff in a dingy room inside a pyramid while you go out and enjoy Mandalay Bay- then this is the place for you."

0,"My fiance and I came into this Walmart and famished we decided since there was a sonic and we've been mcdonalds'd out we would try something different so we ordered and the prices are really getting ridiculous for fast food. The cashier looked bored and was super rude and this was after we were trying to joke with her. Then I wanted to have something to put my ketchup in so I could dip my tots in and two girls smiled at me but never asked me if I needed something and even walked past me a couple times, until the cashier finally \""saw\"" me and asked what I needed and even when I said in a chipper way \""thank you\"" she just looked on zombie like. My fiance wanted a refill on his regular sized drink (coke) and was charged $0.86 which is really ridiculous! If they wanted to they could just refill the cup instead of providing a brand new one.... We walked out having spent $16 and were very disappointed with the food and service- this place is almost enough to stop me from visiting other Sonic Restaurants."
1,"Shuttling between old apartment and my new place here in Sunrise, we had to have breakfast takeaway, and I was pleased.  Delicious. The breakfast burrito was all the fuel I needed for a day of packing and moving. Now that we are solid residents and I have tried other Mexican eateries in the area, I must say, the quality of the cooked meats is levels above the other guys. The carne asada burrito my husband had was made well and I was happy to see that the carnitas in mine was still recognizable as pork. I abhor meat cooked or charred to a tasteless jerky.  I also love that the condiment bar was kept well. The pickled onions are AMAZING and carrots are a necessary accompaniment."
0,I just went into the establishment and was immediately denied service.  I had to greet the associates first and was then told they did not have time for me. They did not ask if I could come at a later time or if they'd be available later in the day. I have never gone to any nail salon & they not want my business for no apparent reason. No bueno!
1,"Makes me wish it was socially acceptable to get Lego at my age.\n\nThis place is like heroin for kids, they go apeshit as soon as they walk through the door.  The staff look genuinely happy to be there and I've caught them playing with the toys themselves a few times.\n\nThe best part about this particular store is the electronics isle, where a collective of young Dad's and their wallets try to stay away from the kids."
1,Rita's reminds me of my visits to New York and New Jersey. I love frozen custard. This location has been around for some time but I barely discovered them about a month ago! Now I don't have to wait til I visit Jersey or New York again to have Rita's. The staff is very friendly and informative. They will let you try flavors until you are sure of your choice! Also ordered a pretzel at my last visit with my ice and I was very pleased. I believe they are even open late til 10pm or so. I will update this review when I confirm their hours.
0,"Restaurant review:\nI had high hopes for this diner in Champaign-Urbana, but I left feeling disappointed. If you like a cheap meal or breakfast item this is likely the place to go. Also if you are eligible for a senior citizen discount, this is a great place to grab a meal. For everyone else, there is so much left to be desired. I don't care about the drab interior that reminds you of a restaurant from the 80s. If the food is good I am there. The prices are cheap for dinner and they have multiple specials everyday of the week. Today was 11.99 all you can eat bbq ribs or pasta. I took at pass an tried the grilled salmon for 12.99. A couple issues came up. First there is no warm bread with butter, you get a trough of saltine crackers so this is clearly wrong in the menu. Second you can chose soup or salad, I went with the soup based on the other reviews. The beef vegetable had a lot of veggies, but no pieces of beef another thumbs down. Finally the meal itself came without any other fixins instead a slice of tomato and lettuce. I have no idea how that goes with salmon. A couple of steamed veggies would have paired nicely. Salmon was okay, nothing special that you couldn't whip up at home. Finally that amazing pie that people wrote about, if you look carefully at the shelf, those are store bought pies. All and all this is a place for 10 dollar ish meal, but I think I might have been better off eating at a fast food restaurant. \n\nPro: cheap breakfast/lunch/dinner, daily specials, seniors discount\n\nCons: store brought pies, no fresh bread with butter which is in the menu, borderline poor-below average meals\n\nHidden gem:\nDaily specials. Check the website, although it does not appear to be updated and constantly shows a Monday special"
0,"I stopped in around 11 pm on a Saturday for a bite to eat. I didn't realize that you had to be buzzed in. That's a bit creepy. Once inside I found the place dead with a cluster of waitresses and bartenders huddled off to the side joking around.\n\n I took a seat at the bar. After a few minutes the bartender tore herself away from her personal conversation to wait on me.  Even after that, the service was slow. The bartender seems miserable to there. She was equally as morose with the few other bar patrons. After going over the menu I asked her opinion on some choices I had narrowed down. Her menu knowledge left much to be desired. I settled on the oysters. They are terribly small and poorly shucked. \n\nThe reason I have this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because it has potential but like many other Yelpers have stated, the service needs improved."
0,"Went there today and have to say I was really disappointed. For being the biggest Forever 21 in the world, they have an extremely small selection of men's clothes- I went there to hopefully exchange a pair of jeans I bought for my husband online, but had no luck finding the same pair in store. That was fine, but I waited in line to do an exchange for store credit and had to explain my situation to three different employees while they kept passing me off to one another- every time I said \""Store credit is fine, I just need to order another pair online\""- then when the third associate finally rang my return through, at the end he told me I actually couldn't use the store credit online and that I would have had to send them back through the mail in order to get a return. I asked if I could have the pants back, then, and he said no, since he already rang it through. What? Finally another associate ran to get the manager and came back 5 minutes later saying that I actually COULD use the store credit online, they were mistaken. Overall it was just such a huge ordeal for what should have been a really simple return and I felt that they were too busy to pay attention to me when I explained in the first place that I needed to order another pair online. Which doesn't surprise me, since the music is so loud in the store that they probably couldn't have heard me anyway. \n\nAs for the women's section, I feel like their prices have just steadily risen over the past few years- I used to go to F21 to get good deals on cute unique clothes but now I feel like everything looks like clubwear or cheap reprints of whatever trendy graphics are popular on tumblr this season (galaxy print, upside down crosses, etc). I feel that the quality of their clothing has decreased steadily while their prices have been on the rise, and if you go in there looking for a specific item you're in for a real scavenger hunt- it doesn't seem to really be organized in a way that makes sense, just room after room of random items. \n\nMy overall impression was that it's a huge store and the employees feel overwhelmed and don't know what's going on. Nobody knew what they had in stock, what their return policy was, how to ring up my return, where to find someone who knew how to ring up my return, et cetera. I know it's a big store and with that many employees it's probably hard to keep everyone on the same page but their customer service really suffers. If you're looking to pay $20-25 for a thin strappy dress and are only making a purchase, this is the place for you, but if you want much more than that you'll be sorely disappointed."
1,"I rarely visit Healthy Home Market because its above my pay grade but it is a great place for health food enthusiasts. They have a lot of unique products, many yummy raw snacks which are what I usually buy. The bulk section is huge, their beer selection is also surprisingly solid for a grocery store with a neat section of local brews. The location on South Blvd also has a smoothie/juice stand and all the smoothies and juices that I have personally tried have been deliciously."
0,"Horrible experience!\n\nIf you are depressed, please Do NOT got to Harmony! ( Ironic name..eye roll)\n\nThe first session is indeed a questionnaire so, no therapy there. Then after a 3 week wait for an appt with an intern/counselor, showing up and waiting for 30 mins they tell me she called in sick. Another 3 week wait, happened again ( at least they called this time) another 3 weeks go by and today..surprise,  I can no longer go to W Post Rd, where I live because the run-down Charleston office 45 mins away is \""wide open.\""  Unless, I pay cash to stay in my neighborhood of course, so still no therapy. \n\nWhat a nightmare! I am more depressed now, that before I tried to get therapy 3 MONTHS ago! \n\nI agree with another poster. This place is about greed only, and should be closed immediately, as they are causing, not preventing harm!"
1,"We were helped by one of the co-owner Sophocles, nice guy. Honey got the Gyro Combo - Includes: Kyklos Gyro, Regular Fries, and a Large Drink - $9.95 and I got the Chicken Gyros - $7.25.  I was looking for some garlic sauce, I don't think the store actually have some, but give us some Tzatziki for free.  Chicken by itself are delicious, once mix it with lot of Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Yogurt.   taste is more mellow.  The Gyro is ok, I like those at Filfila Mediterranean Cafe better.  Fries are crunchy and fresh.  will go there again since I got a $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com for $2 (min. purchase $35)."
0,This place screwed me on the on the check and refused to do anything to take care of it. I have never in my history of dining out been to a place that did that and didn't care about their customers.
0,I was hungry and it was late . I did not feel like eating McDonalds or any of the other garbage on the strip . My friend told me that there is a Korean restaurant that's open pretty late so I decided to try this place . I had the tofu soup which was not spicy and lacked flavor . I also had their dumplings which did not taste that good .
1,"Best salad bar, soups, deli sandwiches, AND the pizza is baked in a brick oven! Prices are really great too! We used to work around here and came to AJ's daily. The staff was friendly and always knew us by name."
1,"Awesome subs, the bread was fresh and tasty. The staff is very friendly. My kids don't eat sandwiches and tried them and loved them. They gave my kids a fire hat which they were really excited about. Friendly greeting when you arrived and a big \""Thank You\"" when you leave. Would definitely go back again."
1,"Though touted as a barbecue joint, Midwood Smokehouse in Plaza Midwood has a Chopped Salad that is the dream of this vegetarian; Avocado, tomatoes, corn, lettuce... oh my! I love the fact that I have an option of a yummy salad when my man is in the mood for some pulled pork and bacon wrapped jalapenos. \n\nWhen a solid salad is on my mind, Midwood is the place I am calling (their pick up window is convenient and parking is never really an issue). \n\nBravo!"
1,Waited for about 20 minutes for dinner but they do make use of technology by texting you when your seats are ready!! A plus!! :)\n\nSoft Shell Crab appetizer:\nUhhhhh what happened??!! This time around the portion was mini me size!! The waitress advised that it was the time of the season.  I remember around summer  time it was twice the size!! That was a downer for me. \nAlbacore Crunch Role:\nThis is similar to eating ahi tuna but a cheaper grade. Filled with mix of bits of shrimp and imitation crab and ponzu sauce. I could eat another one of these. \nYellowtail Toro (belly fat):\nUmmm.....thought this was supposed to melt in your mouth kind of texture?? Wasn't pleased with this one as I'm used to the tuna toro. \nLotus on Fire Roll:\nSpicy tuna with the same shrimp and imitation crab mix and a lotus root chip. \nDynamite Roll:\nBaked onions and mushroom and scallops also with the imitation crab and some spicy mayo sauce.   \n\nEnjoyed the atmosphere. \nMy belly was super 3 month prego-lookin! ;)
0,"PROS: Great lashes, they look so natural, they are smaller in diameter than other salon's I've experienced, and I always get a very full and glamorous look. Natalie is great!\n\nCONS: This place is pricier than others but that's ok when dealing with lashes. HOWEVER, I found this place on yelp, and based on the positive reviews I was interested in trying this place, so I texted Molly to schedule my initial apt. \n\nUsually when a business has a cancellation policy, they inform the new potential client about their policy when scheduling their initial appt. This never happened. I had two fills here, and then on my third I had to cancel the day of the appt. I was still never informed about a cancellation policy at this time either. My fourth or fifth fill the same situation had occurred. I was able to reschedule my fill a week later and still was not informed upon scheduling that I would be subject to a cancellation fee from the week prior. \n\nAfter receiving my usual fill today, literally at the end of my service, I was told to pay an additional $20 cancellation fee for my last scheduled appt. I have no problems with any cancellation policy, in fact I have a hefty fee myself when cancelled on with out 24 hour notice, however ALL of my clients are informed about my cancellation policy upon scheduling whether they are scheduling online, via email, text, or phone. \n\nWhen I contacted Molly about the surprise fee, her reaction wasn't what I had expected. She assumes all her clients would find out about her policy on their own. I have never been on their website where apparently its displayed, and to assume I would read about their cancellation policy on a sign hung somewhere in a room where my eyes are closed 90% of the time is insane! There was so many times I should have been informed about the policy. Especially when she told me my first cancellation I wasn't charged as a courtesy.\n\nWhen explaining how Yelp lured me in to try them, her response was there isn't enough characters in the description on their end to add the cancellation policy for potential clients to see, SO here it is so this doesn't happen to you too:\n\n* Your FIRST cancellation is free (please note: this is when cancelling with same day notice, I can not vouch for this in the event of a no show) \n\n* After that if you cancel on the day of your appointment you are subject to a $20 cancellation fee at your next visit. \n\n* In the event of a no call no show, you will be subject to a 50% service charge of that scheduled appointment, at your next visit. \n\n* All appointments require a 24hr cancellation notice to avoid a fee."
1,My sister in law found this salon through her nail lady . I needed a fill for my lashes and made an appointment . She was easy to get into and her prices where very reasonable . I paid 65 for a lash fill and I will be back! She was sweet and very quick. Her work is beautiful and she has made a new client out of me. I would recommend her to all.
1,OMG... I love this place! I'm not sure how long this place has been here but it's soooo awesome and the kicker is Z pizza is its neighbor and they are connected so you can grab a slice of pizza then go get ice cream or coffee or a latte. Simply fabulous for say a casual day time date the atmosphere is nostalgic and funky... oh and pink! Free wifi and cool tables and couches. Its places like this that are adding flavor to downtown phoenix where I just happen to live... Watch out mill avenue were coming for you in a bigger and better way!
0,"So, I am conflicted here as I was taken here by some co-workers of mine who live in Montreal and the service was absolutely top-notch and the place itself was very nicely appointed and comfortable.  The issue is that none of that fills my belly and being a NY who loves his Italian, I have to weight the food heavier than the rest.  The appetizers were decent with the shrimp being the best.  The duck was a little salty.  Their sauce is meaty as one reviewer pointed out but it is way too sweet and had a pasty consistency when I dined there.  This is not how sauce or \""gravy\"" is supposed to taste or at least what I am accustomed to.  Again, the menu, drinks, service, and the company were all fantastic and some portions of the meal were very good.  I just had an issue with the sauce and for me this is a core component of my Italian food experience."
1,Very good food. Had a turkey club and mocha chocolate cake. So delicious. :) loved the bread for the turkey club. Highly recommend. Didn't give 5 stars bc service was bad.
0,"Love that they have vegan options, love that they are educated about GMO's, food allergies, etc. and, I love their raw burger, well, I used to, I had it tonight and it was hard, like really hard. It used to be DELICIOUS!!! I picked up my food to go and waited quite a bit before anyone even said hello, or took my order. I noticed a couple of customers walk up to the bar to ask for service, one I know wanted more peanut sauce. Before I got my food a mother and son had walked out and they were both shaking their heads. It felt uncomfortable there. I was there a couple of months ago for lunch, had the same uncomfortable feeling but the food was great. And, several months ago I was there with my boyfriend on a Friday night and everything was good, I don't know what's going on. I will give it a little bit before I return, IF I return, I really do applaud the owners of their concept especially on the GMO issue."
1,"This is a a low key place that has a lot of potential. The problem is, it's not located in one of the hottest casinos and certainly didn't have the marketing budget that LAX or Tryst had. That being said, if you bring your own friends to the party you can't go wrong. The eye candy is sub-par, for girls and guys. Fortunately, the disco room with the light up floor makes up for it. If you can dance, this is your scene because if you're on the sidelines, go to a bar and stop wasting space!"
1,"This place is so good! I'm half mexican, but don't enjoy mexican food as much as you would think. This place has made me change my mind. \n\nThe street corn is great! The portion sizes are big and I'm always satisfied when I walk out. My favorite is the shrimp plate with the rice and beans. Their juices are to die for!"
0,Thought I would come here and get my oil changed with a free wash. Well. Won't do that again. Oil change costs less at the dealer. They said the wait for the oil change was 15 minutes but the wash would take a lot longer. The free wash is just a run through and no dry. So I upgrade. I come out after the oil change and there are only two cars ahead of me. The girl working on my car is too busy talking with every one else and not working much on my car. This is silly. My last visit here. $87 total bill. (Including air filter)
1,"I've been here twice now, and I love this place. The atmosphere is my favorite thing about it. It is a place in which I would enjoy becoming a regular.  The outdoor seating on the front patio is very inviting. The drink list is vast, and the pizza is fab. All employees I have encountered have been great! I wish I lived closer so I could hang out there more."
1,The burgers are awesome here! It's cool how you can basically create your own burger with toppings you'd like. I went with a grilled chicken sandwich and it did not disappoint! The fries are also pretty good here compared to most. I recommend everyone to go to bt's!
0,"Really? You all love this place THAT much?? Why? Because you want to pretend you're classy and such seasoned 'wine connoisseurs' while you watch 85 strollers walk by? As you eat your overpriced, shitty sandwich inside the steel walls of a glorified outdoor mall, remember that this is where you are: in a glorified, outdoor strip mall on land that used to be pissed and shit on by all the meth addicts who are currently not even allowed inside the premises. Oh, okay. Makes sense then.\n\nThis is not a place for locals. Locals cannot afford to spend $14 on a SANDWICH that doesn't come with anything. Come on. I know you're anticipating this place becoming 'hip and happening' but it's not there yet! I guess with prices like these, though, they are striving for only one kind of clientele. \n\nI ordered and paid $8 for a grilled cheese. Bread, and cheese, heated in probably a toaster over. Hello, I just moved from NEW YORK CITY, and if I were to get a sandwich for $8, I CAN ASSURE YOU, it would be more than just two pieces of bread and some cheese. \n\nActually, at the 24-hour deli down the block from my last apartment, here is what I got for $7: sopressata (and a retarded amount of it), provolone, lettuce, tomato, mayo, onions, pickles, salt, pepper, oregano, and TOASTED on a HERO ROLL they made there, FRESH, BY THEIR OWN HANDS. any time of day. for $7!! and it's always so damn big that I save half for later cuz - seriously - it's that damn big. This is pretty much a standard anywhere in Brooklyn. I will take a picture next time and edit this post with it.\n\nOne would think, at BIN 702, they'd at least put a tomato on it, or some lettuce, or some SPICES??? Or SOMETHING to give it some flavor. Carmelized onions? Hell, I'd even take some raw red onions. Or chopped up raw garlic. Just do something to pizzazz it for THAT price. That would probably cause it to be an extra $5 for those ingredients. I am still in disbelief I paid for this, if you couldn't tell. And this happened a few weeks ago.\n\n(For reference - this is what I can expect for **$7** - IN MANHATTAN, in the LOWER EAST SIDE, one of NYC's most expensive neighborhoods, at a grilled cheese-specific restaurant called, \""Little Muenster.\""\n\nTHE WORLD'S BEST BREAKFAST SANDWICH\nCrispy Pork Belly/Soft Omelette/Gruyere/Gouda/Kewpie/Amy's Roll. \n\nAND BREAD FROM AMY'S. I rest my case.)\n\nIf you don't believe me, here is an example: http://littlemuenster.com/menu/\n\nLas Vegas - you will never be NYC. Or San Francisco. Not even Chicago, no matter how hard you try. So please, stop trying with your \""artisanal wine tastings\"" and just be your damn self. \n\nAnd, if you *DO* want to be like NYC or SF or, hell, even Chicago, start modeling yourself after their politics when it comes to catering to locals."
0,"After a busy day of shopping, we had the hankering for Thai.  I pulled up my handy dandy Yelp app and saw this place had very good reviews.  We looked at a picture of the menu and decided on the Chicken Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice and the Green Curry w/ Shrimp.  We placed our order over the phone as we wanted to utilize takeout and enjoy the meal from home.  I'm not sure if this altered the quality of the meal, but I think it has to.  I've NEVER had good Pad Thai takeout and this experience was no different.  Upon my arrival at home (10 minute drive), I opened the Pad Thai and it had a gelatinous casing like it was last night's Pad Thai.  I would have taken a picture but I don't think Takeout orders do justice for any establishment.  The Green Curry was OK, but they must be on the metric system w/ a high multiple as we ordered each dish w/ a \""2\"" spice level.  They must have thought I said 20 because I was sweating after four bites of Pad Thai and a spoonful of Curry.  \n\nThe Pineapple Fried Rice was the standout (in a good way) as the sweetness of the raisins and pineapple went well w/ the rice and the overall cook on the rice was on point.  \n\nThe Green Curry was too spicy and overall was just OK.  I'm not sure if I would come back or not."
1,"I almost didn't want to write this review because it seems to be a great hidden gem for Mexican food in CU. Every time I go there, we are seated promptly and it's never overcrowded, which is something I like about the place (if you've ever been to Dos Reales on a Friday night, you know what I mean). Lately, i've noticed it's popularity increasing significantly because there has been a lot more people in there with each trip I make. This leads me to believe that the great food, service and drinks are getting noticed, and I'm really happy about that. I really want this place to do well because it actually is really good.\n\nI've been to Dos Reales, El Torro, Mas Amigos, and La Fiesta - and this beats them all. \n\nEvery time I go, I order something different and have always been satisfied. The portions are good too. The chips and salsa are delicious and everyone at the table gets their own little salsa dish, which I love. The menu has a lot of dishes that you don't usually see, which is fun if you've gotten too familiar with the menus of other places in the area. And the prices are pretty much the same, if not slightly cheaper than other Mexican Restaurants.\n\nAnd if you love Margaritas, then you'll love this place. They are strong, tasty, and thick! I would recommend asking for 2 straws. They are very dense and seem to last forever.\n\nAlso, the service here is top-notch. The wait staff is always, courteous, polite, and very helpful. And quick! I've never had to wait very long for a waiter, or my food. That may change as this place gets more popular, but I can't say that I would mind anyway. \n\nFive stars. My number one choice for Mexican."
1,Stopped by today for some tacos. As always the food was great and service excellent. Not sure why the vegetarian would go here?? It's for people who eat meat. Not people that eat rabbit food. Maybe find a salad bar somewhere else. Over all always solid food with great service and you can't beat the price.

0,Let me begin with I ordered seafood in a land locked state.  That may have been the problem from the get go.  Shrimp fried rice made me sick and my company that had the chicken didn't enjoy it either.  We threw our leftovers out.

I love that I can make my own six packs so I don't have to be tied down to one choice and can mix and match for any occasion.\n\nI also love that you can buy any bottle to drink in the store or saddle up the bar and get some unique drafts from the 12 or so taps.\n\nThe only downside is that the drafts are bit more expensive than most places especially if you get them in half pints (for variety). However, the owners are always great to give you a recommendation based on what you like so I have never regretted trying a pint of something I've never had before."
1,"I decided to give this place a 2nd chance when I saw a groupon for half off. We found a picnic table right by a game of cornhole. Had a few drinks, played a few games, and hung out with our dogs. Our server was friendly and even brought a take out container with water for the pups.\nWe have been back a couple of times since, and always have a fun time. The atmosphere is like no other. I really liked the prickly pear margarita, even at $8 and in a plastic cup :P"
1,"This is a great place for sandwiches. I had a cheesesteak last time I was there and it was great. The cheesesteak here is made with mushrooms, peppers, and provolone cheese. Everything I have tried here has always been very good."
0,"I thought that I had found the deal that I was hoping to find when I found out that I needed to repair all four of my motor mounts.  I was quoted about $1,200 from dealerships and local auto repair places.  I called to get a quote to be placed on hold for 10 minutes because no one there spoke English.  Finally got somebody on the phone and said that it'd be $650.  I immediately dropped my car off next morning and never got a phone call until the next morning because again no one there spoke English.  When I went to get my PT Cruiser they had \""fix\"" all four of my motor mounts, but refused to show me the old ones they claimed to replace.  Finally one of their associates who was able to speak English told me that they had to test drive my vehicle to make sure the mounts were fixed correctly.  85 MILE test drive?!?!?!  I drove my car away feeling like I was screwed and low-and-behold, 4 four months later here I am again with the same issues Sun Valley Auto claimed to fixed..."
0,"So this was my favorite place to get my nails and wax done, I even voted for them as Best of Las Vegas 2013 for nails, however, the guy at the counter opened his mouth to the wrong person. I walked in with my 2 well behaved kids and signed in. They started my water for my pedicure and he says in a very rude way, are your kids going to behave and sit down? Fuck you, really!! I walked out!! Lost my business will never go there again, he is lucky he didn't get punched in the face. There is a way to ask nicely but when it comes to my kids don't assume that my kids run a muck, if you don't want kids in your business (and he isn't the owner) put a sign up, your not a private spa. So people that take your kids places because you don't have a babysitter don't come here, they or HE isn't kid friendly!!"
1,"A little pricey for a lunch place, but the food is excellent."
1,"This venue is huge!  The atmosphere is extremely glamorous.  They hire only the top DJs in the EDM industry.  Kaskade played on opening night, and ATB played while I was here.  If EDM isn't your thing, there are two other rooms that feature different genre's of music (hiphop and top 40).  \n\nI give it four stars because we had trouble getting in with a 5 guy to 7 girl ratio.  Maybe it was because the club is still experiencing the new opening boom, or because ATB was playing.  Even though we got in for free through a promoter, we still had to wait in line for a good three hours.  \n\nThere are plenty of spillover areas for dancing.  When you get too hot, you can head outside where there is an unobstructed view of all the surrounding hotels (the club is on the 17th floor rooftop of the Cosmo).  Drink prices are normal.  Bottle service is quite expensive, but should considered if you have a large party since there are no areas to sit once it hits around 1 or 2 am.  The crowd is young, good looking, and ready to party!  Marquee has definitely cast a shadow on club XS.  Definitely come here for a good time if you are in town."

0,"This is probably the worst hotel/resort I have stayed at.. The only reason I gave them a star was because the front staff was friendly. First off the rooms are WAY smaller then they look in the pictures, the furniture is    chipped and cheap looking. I was excited to stay here because I love the decor of boutique hotels. This one Looks like a fancy  motel 6, definitely not a resort. No clocks, No fridge (extra cost) and no blankets. The waitress at Addiction was nice until we had a question about the check then she quickly had turned into a b*tch. Needless to say I will not be returning here nor would I recommend it to anyone."
0,"I hope that no one ever feels about Starbucks the way I felt about this Starbucks. My sister and I are both Gold Card holders and needless to say we've both been to MANY a Starbucks because we LOVE the drinks and we love the excellent service even more. The experience we had at this location this last Saturday early afternoon was the polar opposite to all other Starbucks experiences we've ever had. My sister went first to reload her card and the cashier just stared at her. No greeting, no how can I help you?, she just was. After she reloaded her card I went next and placed my bottled beverage on the counter and waited for her to acknowledge me. She literally did not say or do ANYTHING for a solid 30 seconds. Mind you she was doing nothing. Just standing there. I kept looking at her smiling wondering why she wasn't ringing me up.. I don't know if anyone's ever just stood in silence for 30 seconds , but that. is. a. long. time. Finally I slid the beverage closer to her and she looks at me and says 'Is that all? as if ringing me up was such an inconvenience. I attempt to explain to her how I received a reward the day before for 25% off any espresso drink and if the code on the email was all she needed for me to redeem. When she confirms it is I ask my sister what she wanted so that she can use it. My sister asks for her advice and she was SO RUDE. First if all you'd think it was her first day because she sounded like she knew nothing about the menu or customer service for that matter, secondly she kept answering my sister with a short sentences like we were annoying her. We asked her if the Espresso Frapp was considered ok under that coupon and she said no because it didn't have espresso. Your telling me the Espresso Frapp DOESNT have espresso??? Huh? My sister and I go to Starbucks over Coffee Bean, Grouchy Johns, Madhouse etc because we love the drinks but even more because we love the customer service. This location can really brush up on their Starbucks Culture training and, on a side note, can really use someone to clean up outside. The entire front of the store was covered in trash bags, water bottles, beer cans, just trash everywhere. Super disappointed. Sad because we just moved to this side of town and it looks like this is the closest location to us, but we definitely will not be coming back here sorry. Needless to say my sister and I didn't order anything and just drove to our favorite location 20 minutes away (Green Valley/Pebble:)"
0,"Even after reading the reviews we tried this place yesterday. Went for early dinner around 4 p m was told seat yourself then a kid brought our menus...Our waitress was actually very nice and friendly. Then this couple walked in...they sat near the door and proceed to yell a conversation with an older gentleman 2 booths away. Annoying to say the least. I ordered the 2 item combo...my husband did the same. I got a Chile Relleno and Shredded beef burrito, he got 2 Chiles. Served quickly....was actually liking eat except in the burrito no beans...then I bit into a piece of hard plastic! When the waitress came to ask about dessert we said no and I handed her the plate and showed her the plastic and said to let kitchen know. We got an apology and our bill....thought there would have at least a discount or a complimentary dessert or come back free entr\u00e9e without plastic ...... paid....won't be back. As a permanent resident not a snow bird we're the ones to make sure are happy  as we would want to support our local businesses in the summer."
1,Shattered my Nokia 928 and had it repaired in no time. Great service - friendly and fast. Highly recommend this place for repairs of all types of phones!
0,"After nearly six years of eating here, today was a shocking experience.  I ordered papya salad, and it tasted OFF.  Too fishy, not enough zing.  I sent it back after a few bites, declining for another plate.  Much to my surprise, THEY MADE ME PAY FOR IT.  That's the last of my dollars you will ever receive!  Didn't even TELL me.  Just dropped the check and said sorry the owner says you have to pay becuase you didn't get anything else.  What?  I was afraid to order more after receiving what appeared to be turned shrimp?  So I have to pay for your food I didn't eat?"
1,"First self-serve yogurt place I've been to that has Snickers pieces for a topping. Sweet!  Other than that, it's your usual yogurt shop with a few selection of flavors and many different choices for toppings.  They even have a option where you can turn your yogurt into shake.  They have free wi-fi which is a plus and they have a small table and TV for kids to use.  It wasn't too busy for a Saturday night, but I've been here in the past and it usually is busy on the weekends."
0,"I had the trainee waitress. Yay me. I wasn't a regular so I was more or less ignored. Fish and chips were mediocre at best, was hoping for more. All waitresses were easy on the eyes so that's a bonus.."
0,I have tried to check this place out 5 different times now during times that their window schedule says they are supposed to be open and every time I go down there the place is closed. Im not sure how they stay in business when they are never open. Now I'm to the point that its not worth wasting the gas to go to this store since chances are that they wont be open when I get there.
0,"Rich people must be so fecking bored to throw money at a stunt like this.  If the individual acts weren't so talented, I would have given it one star.  It felt like an episode of SNL's Stefon listing off dumb shit that eccentric millionaire weirdos need to get an erection anymore.\n\nIn a town where you can see a hundred variety acts on the Strip, this was on par with the quality of performers ... at double the price tag.  I love the Cosmo scene, I love weirdos, and I haaated this show.  C'est la vie!"
1,"Eddie's is one of my favorite Happy Hour spots in Scottsdale! The trick is going after 7PM any weeknight and sitting in the bar. There are specials there on drinks and appetizers that aren't offered in the main dining area of the restaurant, and they're a great deal! The appetizers are amazing (my boyfriend and I usually order 3 of them and share with drinks), and I've had almost all of them at this point. I definitely recommend the horseradish shrimp, if you like a little bit of a kick, and the chicken lollipops are amazing too! The bartender is very attentive and friendly, and though we only go about once a month, always remembers us. (Ask him about the Flatbread of the day... always delicious!)\n\nEddie's is also great if you're looking for a nice holiday dinner. I took my boyfriend there for Passover (I'm not the best cook!), and we had a wonderful meal. They do this kind of thing for several holidays, so if you feel like a splurge, it's a good call! If you're in for a standard dinner, I highly recommend the whats-in-this-Steak. (No, I don't know what's in it... but I do know that it was delicious!!!)\n\nThe only reason to knock Eddie's down a star is the pricing, which isn't a problem if you come in for happy hour. The one time I came in with another couple for a standard meal, we did have a bottle wine, but managed to break the $400 mark on the bill, not counting tip. It's a great place, but I just don't see coming in and spending that when the happy hour is just as good! (Though it was a special occasion, and very delicious!)\n\nTLDNR: Sit at the bar after 7PM on weekdays, great specials there not served in restaurant... and be nice to the bartender, he's a cool guy who will remember you."
0,"I don't need to go back to a smith that refuses to sell pins to a do-it-yourselfer that needs to re-key new doorlocks to older keys.  I will not return to have keys duplicated at this joint nor will I consider them should I need a safe.  This business approach is extremely myopic when one considers how uncommonly a customer will want to re-pin his/her own locks.  \n\nAn employee had to tell me, \""We don't do that,\"" after consulting the decision maker, who sat on his long suffering chair and refused to walk 8 steps to the counter to explain.\n\nFor what it's worth, the locksmith in my homwtown GIVES me the pins I need, and I returned to pay for duplicate keys, difficult re-pins and lock-outs.  I also recommend their services to friends.\n\nTwo way street.  Give and take.\n\nLiberty/Stanley just wants to take."
1,"I came here with my boyfriend and his friends before we left AZ to go back to the bay. I was surprised to see that there weren't tons of people in there as it was a Monday night and tons of games on.\n\nBrennan's is a hug bar and has tons of seating and tv's to get your sports fix. We found a booth and were warmly greeted by our server. The boy and his friends ordered 35 cent wings and I had a cheeseburger with curly fries.\n\nMy cheeseburger and curly fries totally hit the spot. The curly fries were were crispy and had tons of flavor, they were a little spicy. The burger was really filling and was exactly what I wanted! The boys completely devoured their wings, and at 35 cents, you can imagine just how many they had between them.\n\nFor our flight, my boyfriend ordered the margarita chicken wrap and it tasted great even a few hours later...yum!\n\nBrennan's is a solid spot to catch a game and grab some yummy pub food in a laidback environment."
1,"It was convenience that drew me to the Auld Hoose to start with, being as its located very close to a friend's house but boy am I glad it is.\n\nWe wanted somewhere close by to get something quick and easy to eat, and despite initial fears upon seeing the menus at the Auld Hoose, being both sparsely populated and plastic coated, there was really nothing to worry about.\n\nThe menu proudly claims that the nachos are \""probably the biggest in Edinburgh\"" and four of us feeling adventurous chose to take on the challenge. Fortunately another two people turned up because these nachos... were HUGE. Seriously - go and check the picture I added. They happily fed six people. SIX GROWN PEOPLE! That;s ridiculous.\n\nHappily it wasn't just quantity over quality, as the toppings on the nachos were pretty delicious, particularly the chilli itself. People at other tables seemed to be enjoying burgers and other assorted pub grub, and I'd happily come back to try any number of other things from the menu - which ranges from the aforementioned burgers to classics like Stovies and Haggis, Neeps and Tatties.\n\nThe Auld Hoose is first and foremost a bar though and there were a good deal of beers and ales on offer - not to mention an awesome metal jukebox and happily you don't need to be tatted from t\u00eate to toe to fit in - having come straight from work at the time I was *slightly* overdressed, but no one batted an eyelid in my direction. What a lovely place.\n\nMore places with HUGE food and less attitude please."
0,"This place is entertaining as hell.  It was a lot of fun to watch seven or so baseball games at once, and the beer selection was massive.  Unfortunately I got so sick from the food that I had to stay in my hotel room for the rest of the night and miss Cirque du Soliel."
1,"I'm starting out at 3 stars on the \""good on you!\"" principle for bravely combining Tiki chic with Quebecois-Chinese buffet. Bold choice.\n\nThe primary reason to come here would have to be the inexpensive festive fruity drink menu - the full blown Gobo in the pineapple will set you back 8$ and the other fancy drinks are cheaper. There is a band playing requests and cover songs - Latin mostly - on Saturdays. The staff is friendly. The Chinese buffet is usually 11$ and, well. It is what it is. Don't over think it. \n\nIf you can come with a happy crowd and lose yourself in the loops of dreamy drifting Hawaiianish muzak, and in the drinks with their little umbrellas and plastic monkeys, and in a haze of shell lamps galore, near a whole pond full of real live turtles playing pile up... well, it's hard to imagine you'd have a bad time."
1,"I've been to XS twice now and both times have been nothing but great times.  The layout is supposed to be the representation of a girl's body figure, which is obvious when you go to the bar.  XS brings in a lot of DJs on Fridays and Saturdays so just check to see who might be there beforehand if you're not into house music and whatnot.\n\nThe first time I went was back in November for my 21st birthday with my small group of girlfriends on a Saturday night. We got there around 10:30 I think, and there was hardly a line.  We decided to walk to Surrender to get our hand stamps there and get free drinks before going back to XS.  We came back to XS probably about 11:30 and at that point, the line was crazy.  The bouncers pissed us off because we already told one of them that we were on the guest list, but he told us we couldn't pass the line because we had to show him a direct text message from the promoter we talked to.  So then we had to wait for about 10-15 minutes before we could reach our promoter and skip the line.  Considering that it was just a group of 4 girls, this was annoying.  \n\nBut once we got inside the club, we completely got in our zones and started dancing away with random people and had a good time.  They were playing Top40 music which I LOVE.  My friends and I ended up staying there until closing (5AM). Whew my feet hurt like hell but overall an awesome time at XS. I think every Vegas trip I make, XS will always be my default/go-to club."

0,"Rented a vehicle on June 11th, 2009 at 11:00pm, At the pick-up window, I was given an inspection sheet and told to inspect the vehicle, which is common. Please note that the all vehicles are located in a lower level parking garage with energy (very dim) lighting. I inspected the vehicle and didn't find any obvious damage. When I returned the vehicle in the daylight approx. 2:00pm June 14th, 2009 the employee found very small chalk colored nick on the windsheild, lower drivers side near the wiper blade.  The interior dash of the vehicle is almost the same color at night.  He tells me that you did not note this damage on the inspection report. I asked him \""how was I expected to see such a small nick in a covered garage with poor lighting at 11:00pm\"". The lighting is the garage is not adequate to spot minor damage on vehicles. He says in a rude tone \""you need to complain to the airport, they installed these energy saving lights\"". I told them but they won't listen to us.  I told him that there was no need to speak to me in that tone of voice when I've just spent almost $200 renting this vehicle.  So he walked away to retrieve an accident report.  I was asked to complete an accident report, even though I didn't have an accident. The manager then informed me that an investigation would be completed to see if I was at fault.  I was baffled, how could I have caused this to happen when I never drove on the freeway my entire stay in Las Vegas.  I have been renting cars during travel for over 20 years and I have never had such an unpleasant experience.  At this point, I don't ever think I will rent a car from Payless again, unless an employee does the inspection with me prior to me leaving.  If anyone rents a car from Payless, make sure you indicate you saw a nick in the windshield, even if didn't.  This way, you can't be blamed."
0,"Been ordering from this store over the past few years and there is no consistency. I would say they get our order correct maybe 20% of the time. Our last order we ask for the pizza to be well done. Sure enough, it's under cooked. We will not be back!"
0,"Never going to this location again!! I went there around 11pm and ordered wings togo. I went home and liked at the wings and there was barely any sauce and luckily I asked for extra sauce. So I called and talk to the manager and she asked if I want to drive back which I don't because just waste of gas, but she acted like she really didn't care and she didn't even apologize or asked if I want a discount next time or anything."
1,"Very fun! A minimalist setting, Jetson chairs, tangerine/papaya colors on the wall, a great display of colorful toppings and cool green spoons for your yogurt. \n\nNow for the yogurt - the new trend in yogurt is this tart, plain, healthy yogurt. They have it at Tango. I know it doesn't sound great, but have it a few times and this will be your standard. Tango has a nice assortment of toppings, you need to go with their fresh fruit - blueberries are my favorite - for a refreshing taste. \n\nThe two gents working last night were friendly, helpful and kick back casual."
1,"call me a nerd... but it was like a dream come true to eat here.  \n\nI really kicked myself for not having made a reservation, the dining room was completely sold out! However, they have a first-come, first-serve lounge/bar area that will also serve the entire menu.  This actually ended up working out perfectly because we had a show to catch! \n\nThe lounge area is very modern looking.. a waitress immediately greets you and presents you with an ipad which has all the drink details.  The wine list is extensive and actually a little overwhelming... that or I was just too excited to be there to focus...  sensing my indecisiveness, our waitress recommended a red blend, Prisoner.  It was a little shocking at $28 a glass but man, oh man, was it good.  And having overheard that we had a show to catch, our ever helpful waitress -who's name i wish i could remember- suggested we put in our orders ASAP because they were expecting a party of 70! \n\nWe started with a shared caesar salad.  I usually steer clear of the caesar salads because I hate anchovies and have a pretty sensitive palate.. i couldn't taste any at all in this one.  It was just delicious with generous amounts of parmesan cheese and garlic croutons.  There were also some breaded quail eggs in there - i wasn't such a fan of those.  \n\nAlso, the bread basket is freaken amazing, each piece of bread had such a unique taste to it.  I couldn't get enough!\n\nNow the main attraction: \n\nThe Mother Effing Beef Wellington.  Holy crap was that thing good.  To quote a prior review, \""life changing.\""  \n\nGo there.  Get the beef wellington.  just do it. \n\nI really really really wish we would have had time for dessert.  The sticky toffee pudding around us looked so mouth watering!\n\nuntil next time!"
0,"Took my two year old here the other day and was charged $6 for her to paint and was also charged half the adult fee because \""I helped her\"".  She's two.

1,"I love the pan fried noodles with chicken. The sauce is delicious and just enough of the noodles are crispy. I think it's actually the only main dish I've ever ordered there because I love it so much. The service is consistently slow and I've been there a few times when they've mixed up orders. One time, I was there with as part of a party of 4. They gave my dish to another group, gave me the wrong dish and it took them like half an hour for them to get me my food. Meanwhile, the rest of my group was finishing up by the time I got mine. It was infuriating.\nFood - consistently awesome - 5 stars\nService - sooooo sllooooowwww - 1-2 stars"
1,"Tucked away in the gem that is Lake Las Vegas, you will find a small Marina where you can rent kayaks for $25.00/hour, and electric boats for $60.00/hour. You can also get paddle boats and boards. \n\nI recently held an event at the lake and Grant who works at the Marian couldn't have been more accommodating! \n\nI went on my first paddle board excursion and he gave me all the tips I needed to keep me from falling in the icy water. My guy and friends were convinced I was was going to fall in! Damn, have a little faith! \n\nWith reasonable prices, and a variety of water crafts, this is a must when you are looking for something different to do in Vegas."
0,"Super disappointed in the food! Honestly, it made me sad. Had the Chicken Fried Steak. Neither it nor the gravy had any flavor. The Freedom Fries and Sweet Tea were amazing though. Sent it back but told the waitress I wanted to keep the fries. She said she'd being me fresh ones so I said of course, no biggie. Ordered the Chicken Tenders. Again, no flavor so I stuck with the fries and called it a night. When the check came, I was charged extra for the fries... Won't come back again."
0,"This review is for the cheese sandwiches only. I've been dying to try this place, and I'm sure their cheeses are great. However I find them to be a tad bit overpriced, so instead I tried one of their cheese sandwiches.  \n\nCheddar, Gouda, pickles, mustard on sourdough... It can't be bad. But it wasn't great either. The bread was very dry and the insides were sparse and low on flavor.  For a tiny $7 cheese sandwich, I expected more. It wasn't bad; it just wasn't worth $7."
0,"I must say... I was really looking forward to having dinner here. We were on a quick weekend get away in Scottsdale for my 32nd birthday, and I booked this place to celebrate with the love of my life. \n\nBoy oh boy, what a disappointment !!! We arrived, and I was impressed with the atmosphere, decor, and the fantastic view stretching across the phoenix urban sprawl. When we checked in with reception, we were informed that we would have a 10mn wait to be seated outside.\n\n\""10mn ? Not a problem !\"", I said, and continued on to state that we would grab a drink at the bar and sit outside to take a look at the view, while we waited to be seated in the dining area.\n\nAnd we waited. And waited. And waited. All the time, seeing free seats being taken by others (although there was no one waiting behind us). We ended up asking about it, and they were quite rude, did not apologize, and ended up telling us that they had been looking for us, but we were no where to be found, which is IMHO a load of bullocks, given that we had made eye contact with the floor manager several times during our wait. In the end, we got seated by the bus table, still outside, my mood souring by the minute... but hey, it was my birthday, I wasn't going to let something like that ruin the moment.\n\nI wasn't surprised by the prices, as I knew what we were getting into. I was however, surprised by the crappy quality of the dinner we had for the $ we paid. \n\nThey brought the perfunctory \""amuse gueule\"", which was a joke, to be honest. If I was a restaurant manager, I would be literally embarrassed by what they deigned to serve: 2 table spoons of some sort of artichoke bisque served in a large mug... makes you feel like someone scraped the bottom of a soup pan and was serving you yesterday's leftovers from the local penitentiary. I was quite unimpressed. Gordon Ramsey would have had a fit.\n\nAt this point, we were also annoyed with the high powered, halogenic lights, that are pointed right in your face, literally blinding you when the beams catch you at the right angle... I was starting to have a head ache, as was my wife.\n\nThey then came around to serve us some bread and pesto butter, which I must say was pretty nice tasting.... (but come on,... how hard is it to screw up bread??).\n\nWe perused the wine menu, and decided to order a South African white chardonnay, from the Stellen Bosch region (Mirlest white)... which was pretty good. Nice touch was that we didn't finish the bottle, and they re-corked and bagged it for us before leaving... which was a plus...\n\nAs a starter, I had the pan seared foie gras... which was a bit too gelatinous for my liking (have had way better)... the waffles were a nice touch. It reminds me of a restaurant in Paris that used to serve foie gras with ginger bread... quite nice... the sweet and salty combo always works wonders.\n\nMy wife ordered the Chevre walnut tarte... one piece of advice... stay the hell away from it. Its mainly a medley of thick, sandy crust and walnut powder,  with ABSOLUTELY NO DETECTABLE trace amounts of goat cheese.... For 11$, it was an absolute rip off. The server initially didn't react when we told him that this dish was absolutely not a success... however, he did later take it off the bill.\n\nMy wife just had a really unlucky evening. Being vegetarian, she ordered the Vegetarian Trilogy.  What this ended up being was a soggy vegetable lasagna, served with a supposed macademia truffle sauce that tasted more like peanut butter, except that it was even more bland and greasy.... The truffle scented gnoccis that we ordered as a side dish, looked like, and tasted like stale, soggy, greasy fries... yuck.\n\nI however ordered the diver's scallops and lobster, which was pretty good. Not the softest lobster, but damn tasty, and the scallops were perfect, and huuuge. \n\nNo dessert, as we were pretty disgusted with the whole experience.\n\nNet/net: expensive place, crap value for money, food is totally hit and miss, but the view is nice, if they can deign paying attention to the service they provide...."
0,"Bah. You know when you keep giving somewhere just another chance because it used to be good? Well, I think last night was the night I gave up. \n\nI used to love Khushi's in Victoria Street. It was a dramatic building, and I had some great food there. \n\nThen it burnt down, and they moved to a fairly boring cellar under the Pear Tree and - I don't know, seemed to lose their way. Sauces were boring and tasted 'out of a jar', and worse, the staff would positively force feed you to get you out fast. But I reasoned to myself that I had gone during the festival and at Christmas, and nowhere is at its best when it's so busy. \n\nFinally, Khushi has its new home, in Antigua Place at the top of Leith Walk. It's taken over a big space that used to be Massimo's (I miss Massimo's), and from the outside it looks bright and cheerful and the place-to-be. \n\nSo last night I called and asked for a reservation for four. They had a table, though we'd have to be out in 90 minutes. That seemed fair, we just wanted a quick meal. \n\nFrom the second we arrived, though, it all went wrong. We were shown into a bare 'overspill' room off to the side, harassed to order fast, and then the unsmiling waiter announced that he'd 'bring your starters and mains at the same time, because you have to be out soon'. Charming...\n\nAnd so he did, slapped everything down and off he went, to practise his lack of social skills on someone else. \n\nThe food was okay, I suppose - fish pakora were tasty, the veg pakora a bit dry for my liking. My tandoori monkfish - I've had it before there and loved it, but last night it was a bit overcooked. And... maybe not actually monkfish? The texture just wasn't quite right so I was suspicious. \n\nAnyway, we ate, we got full. Mostly it was basic British Indian food in over-creamy sauces. And we were finished long before the time they were due to throw us out.\n\nThere are too many good restaurants in Edinburgh to have to put up with actively rude service. I've had enough, and won't be back."
1,"This Great Clips is a very nice location.  Now, I don't go here for my regular haircuts because I usually go to a different salon for a full service experience since I usually have some dyeing action going on, but that doesn't mean I don't like Great Clips.  Here's the scoop:\n\n1. This location is very easy to get in and out of pretty quickly.  You can call ahead or use the app to add your name to the list, so you really do not have to wait, if you don't want too.\n\n2. The do awesome bang trims, as well as great full head trims if you just need a quick inch cut off in a hurry.  I haven't gotten a full on hair cut here, but I do get trims when I just can't get to my regular salon.\n\n3. Cheap with good service!  $11 for a haircut!  My hubby is here at least once a month and has always been happy with his service.  I have always had good experiences here as well with my trims.  Good service and cheap is a great combo!\n\n4. They also have some great products for sale.  If you run out of your Paul Mitchell, Redkin, Bed Head, you can pop in here and grab some more in a jiffy.\n\nSo if you need a haircut or a quick trim, this is a great spot."
0,"Sehr gute Auswahl an Apple Produkten in Karlsruhe und auch ansonsten umfangreiches Angebot. Man kann fast alles ausprobieren und wird in der Regel gut bedient.\n\nAllerdings bin ich mit dem sonstigen Service nicht einverstanden. Teilweise konnte mir am Telefon keine Auskunft \u00fcber die Verf\u00fcgbarkeit gegeben werden (\""eigentlich m\u00fcsste noch ein Airport Express da sein ...\"") und auch die Best\u00e4nde im Gravis Online Store waren in zwei konkreten F\u00e4llen nicht korrekt. Nachdem ich wirlkich zweimal umsonst in die Stadt gefahren bin (und vorher den Filial-Bestand im Online Store abgefragt hatte), ist mir der Aufwand f\u00fcr weitere Besuche schlichtweg zu hoch.\n\nVon mir keine Empfehlung. Ich kaufe zwar trotzdem bei Gravis aber sicher nicht mehr in dieser Filiale."
0,Worse customer service at auto center. Don't online order. They don't have a clue what they're doing here. Will take long.
1,"Awesome food that is fusion of Brazil Japan and peru. Wife has Chilean sea bass. Pretty cheap plate under $30 at sushi samba. Not bad but not the best Chilean sea bass. I have better at other restautant.\n\nI had a cut roll that was only three pieces but we'll worth the money. The cut roll has tuna, foie gras,  caviar, and gold flake!! Believe it was $20. I couldn't tell the difference but I ordered it for the heck of it.\n\nPeruvian corn which are big and pulpy. Quite different taste.\n\nAs for atmosphere, awesome place to hang out and have a cocktail while meeting eye candy lady in a loud atmosphere with a DJ. If you are into it."
0,I just had the Montreal burger.  It was the driest beef burger I've had in a long time. Way over cooked. There was no flavor to the meat so I added ketchup and mustard.\n\nThe gravy in my poutine was tasteless. The only good thing was the cheese.  I love poutine so I was pretty disappointed.  I also noticed that the girl sitting close to me made a comment about her poutine and was given a new one.\n\nI've had great Quebecois food in the past and this was a huge disappointment.
1,"Legs' paradise!\n\nMy first day in Edinburgh was a tough one for my legs. The - Meadows - Royal mile - Princes street and garden - Castle - Grassmarket - National Gallery - Buccleuch St - Bruntsfield - connection was part of my walking task. At night, they were looking for some rest, but my eyes and mind were too amazed to go to sleep. \nAn internal agreement was reached when I recalled about the Dominion. \n\nThe old-stylish building was easily recognizable from Morningside Rd.\n\nI asked the ticket counter for the next available movie. There were \""Oblivion\"", but it was sold out (anyway, I don't like Tom Cruise as an actor, so I didn't complain :) and \""Side effects\"" that would have started within a few mins.\nLet's go that side!\n\nThe place looked cosy and comfy at first sight (especially my feet's first sight, I might add). Just a few rows of huge sofas with plenty of space and stools to keep your legs on. I didn't buy anything at the bar, since I was coming from Katie's Diner, but rushed to my seat to get off, rested and grateful, only at the end of the film! \n\nA perfect happy end for a beatiful day."
1,"Found Wellington Coffee through recommendations on a coffee blog and it did not disappoint. Very small place, in a central location, with just 10-15 seats or so indoors (there are same tables outside as well but since it is Scotland it means that most of the time those cannot be used anyway.). At Wellington they serve coffee from Square Mile so it is of course great coffee - the Synesso machine also ensures that the equipment is good enough. The times I've been there the people behind the machine have also know what they are doing. Had some excellent espressos and also good cortados here and actually think they are a notch above Artisan Roast. The downside here is that they do not offer any filter coffee - love places with a good selection of single origin filter coffees.\n\nI did also have the scones here and they were also good, not a reason in itself to visit but if here for the coffee and a bit hungry do try the scones as well. A minor annoyance was the service which was slightly arrogant and almost had an attitude of that they were doing you as a customer a favor for serving you. Still the coffee was good enough for me to go here several times during my last visit to Edinburgh."
1,"Love this place! Fifties Diner food, and atmosphere!"
1,"Well I went to school here and loved it and I feel like I got a great education. It may be huge but once you find your niche you will do just fine! You just have to make sure you go to class and take good notes because most classes are so huge they won't harass you to come, yet just expect you to! I loved the Big Ten games and the energy of the campus. I would never have picked a different place to spend four years!"
0,"I had just finished telling my friend how much I loved Simons last time I went two years ago... and then I was forced to eat my words! \n\nFirst off I saw the SAME argyle sweater (same colour, same price and same brand) that I saw last time I was there two years ago.\n\nSecond I can only speak for the woman's section when I say the clothing quality and style is similar to the of H&M or Forever XXI but with a much higher price tag.\n\nLast but not least, and honestly this was the clincher and main reason why they are getting a 2 and not 3 stars... THERE IS NO SHOE SECTION! When the sales clerk said this to me I honestly gasped and walked out of the store (backwards!)\n\nHonestly how can you be a department store without shoes?! For shame Simons... for SHAME!\nI should note that the men's section seems much nicer, but ladies go to The Bay (La Bai) down the street is much better: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-bay-montreal#query:bai"
0,"Sorely disappointing here. Caveat: I booked with a Priceline rate. \nHowever, the issues I experienced are issues no matter what you paid.\n\nLargest issue: Housekeeping/Cleanliness.\nMy family booked 3 rooms to stay in. I changed twice, due to noise and cleanliness in rooms.\nSo, I experienced 5 different rooms on two different floors.\nALL of them had mold/mildew in shower/bath area. ICK. It's hard to fathom that a 4 dollar bottle of Tilex could resolve this. \nALL of them had an issue with bed linens, either being dirty or incorrectly put on bed (ie, incorrect sheets top vs bottom, missing items, etc)\nMy second room I was in, I pulled back the sheets, and there was a LARGE black line/stain on the sheet. Can't miss it.\nIs housekeeping even looking at what they are doing? I'm always willing to roll with small things, as I know mold/mildew can creep up on any bathroom, but it was so prevalent, and in all corners/crevices in ALL 5 rooms.\nJust laziness? Incompetence? I don't know.\n\nThis in itself is unacceptable no matter what hotel you stay at, hell, the Red Roof Inn for $30 a night usually is pretty decently clean.\n\nOn top of this, the furniture is dinged up, the sliding doors into the bathroom in all of the rooms were dinged and dirty.\n\nThis hotel is billing itself as a notch ABOVE other Wyndhams, but being a \""Grand\""\n\nNothing Grand here. \n\nyes, wifi worked and was relatively fast. Yes, it has technically been renovated to flat screen tvs and nicer countertops, but this does not make up for basic housekeeping issues.\n\nI told Priceline they need to remove this hotel from the options for 4-star."
0,"Open on time and have a dedicated line for your customers to call. Is that too much to ask. I go there 2 hours after the are supposed to be open and they are still closed. So I call the number listed and its some guys cell phone and he doesn't even answer with the name of the place. Just a \""yeah\"" Not dependable with questionable service so can't recommend it."
0,"I've been to Lux twice since they've made the move next door, and I figured it was ok to give a review. I have been to Lux countless times over the last few years. It has always been the place to see and be seen, with coffee service that is definitely above Starbucks, but I will admit struggles in certain areas. \n\nLux, in its former space, was a small shop, always packed and definitely had its crowd. If you weren't a part of the crowd, you'd receive a \""look\"" of, \""hey, who are you?!\"" Look past that and hop in line for a cappuccino and it would make up for it.\n\nThe new space, well... it caters to the exclusivity of the \""hipster\"" crowd. Walk through the door that you THINK is the entrance... and wander around. The kitchen, espresso bar and cocktail bar are all broken up and there is no definitive flow of service. Also, is that a customer wearing the tight jeans and cardigan? Or is that the staff? Who knows? Luckily I have a friend who works there and was kind enough to show me around and how the flow of service works. If you're not that lucky, best of luck to you, as you're left to your own sense of direction as how to order, sit down, etc. From what I gather, you can order an espresso drink and sit wherever and they'll call your name when your drink is ready. However, I'm not sure about the cocktail bar. The only way I think you would order would be by sitting at the bar? Not sure about ordering food from the kitchen.\n\nI will admit, I haven't ordered any food from Lux yet, apart from a pastry for my coffee. I had a croissant, which was pretty good and went really well with my cappuccino. I'm a fan of a free-pour cappuccino, however the cappuccino that I was served on this visit had the foam scooped on top. This confused me, because I saw other customers order a cappuccino and get one free-pour. Maybe it depends on the barista? Kind of inconsistent. I did sit down at the awkward cocktail bar and order a drink. The bar has normal height seating and a raised bar for the bartender. It's awkward when they lean down and tower over you to deliver a drink. Anyway, I ordered the \""Number 47\"" cocktail with gin, Green Chartreuse, St. Germain, lime, mint and cucumber. I'm a huge fan of Green Chartreuse and gin so I was excited to try it. They didn't have any cucumber in house, so they made it without it. Jeff (the owner) commented, \""Well today it's just the 46.\"" Hmm... Alright. So I took a sip of the cocktail. It was decent. Nothing exciting at all. It was overpowered by the mint and the lime in the cocktail. It masked the green Chartreuse too much. It really NEEDED that cucumber to mellow out the mint and lime so you could taste all of the ingredients.\n\nOh well... what can you do when the owner doesn't seem to mind that ingredients are missing? \n\nOverall, props to Lux for being busy at 3pm on a Thursday afternoon and being a successful establishment, which may be from the same established clientele from before the expansion. The coffee and pastry has remained the same, which is ok with me. However, the cocktail bar tries a little too hard, I think. Also, the decor and vibe has definitely turned Lux into the \""hipster mecca\"" and excluded the general public from it's demographic. Which, I can't complain or comment too much, because they are doing just fine. The flow of the restaurant is choppy and confusing and the staff is less than considerate (with a few exceptions). There's my two cents, for whatever it's worth."
1,"After my yoga class with my gf, had a pretty decent breakfast here... I like the feel of the restaurant, laid back!!  Definitely will go back again!"
0,"Ok,  I hate to pile on to this place.  It has SOOO MUCH potential and the whole area wants them to succeed!  The restaurant itself is really nice inside and out and the concept seems like it would be a lot of fun but.... It's not.  \n\nThe service is slow and seems confused.  They food is well.. just blah.  I have been there twice and it is the only time in years of eating out that I have felt the need to add salt and pepper to my dishes, BOTH TIMES!  There are way too many really good places to eat just minutes from this restaurant for about the same price.  Also, what is with the truck Trailer(s) in your parking lot.  It's not a big lot in the first place.  \n\nOk so enough bashing.  You have a great concept and a great looking restaurant.  Figure out your kitchen so food comes out timely.  Tweek your recipes so the food had a lot more flavor.  (We put up with \""True Food\"" portion sizes only because the food is pact with flavor.) Organize your servers and wait staff so it is more efficient and organized (you may think it's organized but it doesn't seem like it or look like it.) Finally, if you want it to be a neighborhood hang give us a GREAT Happy Hour! Good drink and appetizer specials and a cheap kick-butt Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's on the weekends.  I really hope you guys get it together because you could be a lot of fun!\n\nOh and fix your water in the bathroom hot is always on the left!"
1,"I like this place! It's quiet, the place is big and laid out well.. the slot selection is awesome to boot, and hell I visited the little Grand Cafe to grab lunch and the waitress was nice enough to offer me the $9.99 special for a steak with mashed potatoes and greens.. gotta say was the best steak I ever had at $10 seriously topping other places that charge double.. On top of it being a nice place I won $75 easily paying for my lunch and dinner later on that night! Station's are great casinos they don't try to be anyone else but themselves and treat you right."
1,"The best burger joint in the whole country, I ordered the damnation chicken burger with chocolate smoothie, I did not have any burger taste in my mouth like that. the Parmesan truffle fries. it is pricey but it's worth it. I tried Jack in the Box and Sonic but nothing like Gordon Ramsay burger. his a tip for two people to order your own burger and drink and share order of fries."
0,"My wife and I went here for the first time on Super Bowl Sunday. Expecting it to be crowded, we were pleasantly surprised that there were only 8-10 people in the whole restaurant. We were seated immediately and our server brought water and warm bread with plain olive oil and a splash of balsamic vinegar. No spices, just oil and vinegar. The bread was tasty, but the vinegar overpowered the plain olive oil. We ordered and the food came out relatively fast. I had the Chicken Marsala with fresh seasonal vegetables. The chicken was way overcooked and the vegetables were actually burnt, black and crispy. There was no marsala sauce and everything was over salted. My wife had the flank steak salad, which is described as med-med well doneness on the menu. It was very well done also. She described the dressing as watery and fairly tasteless. I was so disappointed in the food after watching this place go up over the last months. I was hoping for something hip and casual in the Italian market to add to our minimal choices this far out in the E Valley......sadly that is not the case. The building is a modern design and they have a wonderful patio. I hop that they can hire a better cook, because if they don't, I'm afraid they will not be around very long. And $10 Italian margaritas?? Come on!"
0,"Ate here, nice joint, low key place to just chill and hang out....but the food wasnt very good. Most of the dishes we ordered were not very tasty.\n\nSpice level was high--but other flavors were lacking."
1,"Oh Za's, how I love thee.\n\nIt's changed a bit since I graduated, but it's always been one of my favorite places to get fresh-tasting, delicious food on Green Street.  Seriously, where else would you go?  I've been a fan for years.\n\nI have always loved their pastas the best, and they've really expanded the options. Last time I went, I got multigrain rotini with pesto and veggies.  It felt really healthy and light, even though it was a sizable portion.  The huge and delicious piece of garlic bread did kind of counteract the \""light\"" feeling, however...  I also had one of their delicious smoothies, and I have never gone wrong by ordering any of their infinite combos.  Anything with mango in it is an automatic favorite of mine!\n\nYeah, it's not gourmet, but for an inexpensive lunch that isn't fast food or a chain place, it's definitely the best you can get in Champaign.  And oh, the nostalgia factor..."
0,Gone are the days when this place was the non-Wetherspoon's option for cheaper drinks on George Street. Deals seem to be a thing of the past and the pints are all over \u00a34 (Peroni coming in at over \u00a35). Our barman last night was a cheery chap but that alone's not really an enticement to be back anytime soon.
1,"I'm from ABQ, NM so when someone puts NM on their signage I review seriously. I've eaten here about 5 times, breakfast and lunch. I had the chicken enchiladas with green chile good, then I had huevos with xmas good for Arizona, then one day I tried the shredded beef enchiladas with red and it all came together. \n\nThe shredded beef is so tender and flavorful! The corn tortillas are thicker than I am used to but good, the red chile is truly awesome and I know red chile. This is NM red, it's not my Dad's red which is the ultimate but to find in AZ, in Gilbert? Awesome. Just the right amount of quality cheese too. I cleaned my plate. I never clean my plate I always leave something out of respect for my waistline. Not this time.\n\nThey have chips and salsas available via self serve, salsas are good with some bite but very salty.\n\nBoth my boys ordered bean and cheese burritos, they were huge and they were devoured. \n\nWe drank water as they only have Pepsi, iced tea & coffee. For my enchiladas & two burritos it was $14 something.\n\nThe place is small and you order up front and then find a table, they have maybe 10 (4 & 2 tops), self serve drinks and aforementioned salsas. They will bring your food to your table amazingly fast. Sometimes you also get complimentary cinnamon chips that are great but only when they aren't too busy apparently as I've gotten them twice even after asking to pay for them.\n\nThe service and the people/owner are so incredibly welcoming and friendly you feel good spending your money there!\n\nI left off the 5th star because I like my chile hotter/spicier (I know most don't and he wants to make it a successful business), with fresh chopped white onions not green onions and with a cold beer and a lime."
1,"Romantic little restaurant in a quiet location.  We happened upon it by accident and I was definitely underdressed but the staff said \""don't worry\"" and made me feel at home.\n\nI had the filet mignon and they let me substitute rice for mashed potatoes due to my dairy issues.   Food was awesome, everything fresh.  Full bar and great meals means we will be coming back, hopefully soon!  \n\nPS: Parking is easy since they have their own private lot in back."
1,"Small place. Fast and good service. I enjoyed the Kamikaze roll the most. Liked the Orion, Lemon, Spicy tuna rolls. I had some cajun albacore and salmon nigiri as well as a seaweed salad. All were made well and were tasty. I hear this joint is open late. I am sure I will be back as well."
0,Last night they delivered a pizza so cold the included garlic sauce had congealed into a solid.  Time before they got the order wrong.  Won't be ordering from here again.
0,"I hate this place. Ok granted I have only had about 20 pedis in my entire life, and only two other places to compare it with, and my feet are awfully ticklish but I really don't think I am the worlds pickiest, princess. I had been going here for two years  because it is right next to Massage Envy. One stop pampering huh? You would think. and  it took me a while to write a review because I could not put my finger on what it was about this place I hated but I think I have it now. I went 4 or 5 times and I alway felt very uncomfortable here. I wasn't sure why but I think it was because I felt like I was a  member of a cattle herd. In and out, no smile,  no service. They were always in a rush to get me done and onto the next person waiting. Welllllll,  a pedi is a splurge and  a treat to your inner peace and not cheap SOOO, since I am paying you a bit of my hard earned money could you at least act like you like me and or the fact that I am the paying customer? Oh well,  I kind of blew it off and figured all places were like this.( Even though the other two places I had been to in the past were not  like this)  I continued to go because this place was a little cheaper and more convenient.  I went back a few more times until The last time I went in this past winter. That was the last straw. ( Plus they raised their prices!) The girl was so rude to me for no reason known. I was very nice to her and she just kept ignoring me and hurting me. I asked her to go easier and she did not  and rolled her eyes. At the end of the pedicure she did not give me the sandals they usually give for drying time and  tried to put my shoes back on to soon and smeared the polish on my big toe. OMG she acted like it was all my fault. She actually got mad at me! She  rolled her eyes and got really bent out of shape!I couldn't believe it. She huffed and puffed back to get the polish remover and mumbled when she had to repaint my toe. After she repainted my toe she again tried to put my shoe back on without any dry time.  Well somehow my foot tensed up as I tried to help her out by pushing my foot a little into the shoe and she had the nerve to yell at me and slapped my foot. She barked \""STOP IT!\"" and told me to cut it out and relax my foot and again with the rolling of her eyes with a side helping of attitude. What is this all about?????Are all pedi place like this I wonder. Follow up- Months later-  Ok, so today my friend tells me she  had a pedi yesterday and the lady told her her feet were ugly. \n(They are not,. She is a gorgeous gal all around. However,  either way HELLO???? Are you really gonna tell your client that? JEEEEEZZ LOUISE).  Lo and behold, yup, you guessed it, the same place! YIKES!!!! RUN AWAY! I went to the place in Spectrum Mall and had a better pedi and it was much cheaper."
1,"My wife and I had dinner at the new Walnut Grill last night.  I usually wait a couple months until the bugs are worked out of any new restaurant, but my friends said the food was great and to give it a try.  We weren't disappointed. The the balsamic and wild mushroom chicken dishes were fantastic.  The table service was excellent.  The only snag was waiting a short time on a reservation.  Again, we eat out regularly and have experienced nightmares going to new restaurants.  This was a minor issue for us since they were extremely busy.  I gave them 5 stars based on what they accomplished in a short period of time.  The food and table service are worth the wait, but make make reservations on weekends to avoid longer waits."
0,"I usually love Aladdin's but today it was unbelievably awful. I will go back again and hope things have changed. \nFor starters they charged me twice for tea (4.50) b/c they gave me a second tea bag. Had I known that it would cost me an additional 2.25 for a single bag of cheap tea I would not have ordered it. The least the waitress could have done is have told me that my \""free refill\"" was not, in fact, free. \nAlso, the tuna in the grilled tuna salad was disgustingly fishy and overcooked. I usually order something different (the mishwi or lamb salad) so I am unsure if this is how it usually is but also the fact that no one seemed willing to fix the issue makes it far worse. \n\nI told the waitress that she should have told me about the extra charges and her answer was that I was correct about her having to tell me but that she didn't and basically that sucks for me. No answer on the fish. \n\nI have been a long time customer and am sorely irritated that I was treated this way."

0,"Wow, I've been here a total of 2 times and both times I've confirmed one thing.  This really isn't somewhere I want to be.  Very young crowd normally in here and I've equated bulls in bars to be something that just doesn't sit well with seeking a more mature crowd.  But I highly doubt the owners of BAR really care because the place does get packed and the youngin's there seem to really love the place.\n\nThe music they play seems to be a good mix, they go through a cycle of typical club hits and some 70's throwback."
1,Nice to eat where the locals eat. Try the Crazy Alfredo... now thatz-a-spicey-a-meatball!
1,My friend and I found this place on yelp and loved it! We were seated right away and we both had a full set done for a reasonable price ($20!) And they said the next time we come back it would only be $14 for a fill! But they were very friendly... ask for Roger!
0,"This place sucks today. No cheese pizza and they said thirty minutes, it shouldn't take 30  minutes for one of their most popular items during lunch time. Chinese food is set up totally different here too.  I always get a two item combo with rice or noodles and this one doesn't offer that, only one item for same price of $8.99 and the girl wouldn't mix items.   Girl working was super unfriendly and after I asked about the pizza she went and helped somebody else instead of finishing up with me, I still had items to order.  I will probably not go to this location again, very unhappy with their customer service.  When you are paying for a high quality item there should be high quality service to go along with it."
1,Damn good pho and I was incredibly spoiled in Seattle so... yeah.  So far my favorite pho place in all of Phoenix.
0,"I stopped here for lunch and the only thing positive to say was that the service was good and people friendly.  However the food was blah..I had a chicago beef sandwich and the beef didn't have any flavor and was tough.  And I asked for the \""wet version\"" which was just au jus on the meat..but it still made the bottom half of my sandwich soggy and the bread then was like glue..ick!  Also the bathrooms smell HORRID!  Like they have a sewer problem.  So, I wouldn't go back."
0,"The airport location gives the stand alone locations a really bad name. We go to the Scottsdale location frequently and love it there. This was our first time trying the airport location. I got the most pathetically small and dry chicken wings. They didn't taste good at all. The rice in the rice & beans was severely undercooked. When I went to the counter to replace it with something else, three employees walked right past me without asking if I needed help. I finally had to flag someone down. I replaced the rice & beans with potato salad. The potato salad seemed as if it was just taken out of the freezer.  \n\nI can't imagine this place will last very long at the airport. If they don't close the doors themselves, I'm sure Sky Harbor will kick them out eventually."
0,I have up and down run in with this place. It's too often down. This time was too much. I was not help by Bob. I asked a few questions and he acted as if I requested a personal loan from him. Very rude. If I can avoid SW I will. Thanks Bob you really made sure to ruin my experience.

1,"I have to admit I was worried after trying to place my order that I wouldn't be writing a good review for this place, but I am so happy to say I was wrong.  I went in with my mom and we wanted to share a sandwich and since we don't like the same things on our subs, we asked to have the onions on the side.  We were told they couldn't do that and aren't allowed to.  Seemed strange to me, but whatever.  The team working didn't seem to know much about the menu either, but I have to say that our sandwich was great.  A simple ham and cheese but the bread was great and all of the fixings were fresh and tasty.  Beware of the hot peppers...they are serious!  Overall, since the food is the most important part, this place is worth it."

1,"Found this place in the Palazzo when we were looking for a place close by Wynn that wasn't too expensive and yet not food court food.\n\nOriginally ordered the Maui Rib Eye ($28), but it came out well-done instead of medium rare... Non-edible.  Since they were going to make a new one, I opted for the regular Rib Eye Steak. The Maui Rib Eye was too sweet for me, and took away all the meat flavors. The flavor of the regular Rib Eye was just perfect. I opted for a side of Asparagus instead of a baked potato.\n\nGreat service! The waitress took one look at my well-done steak and offered to bring me one that was prepared right."
1,"I found this place by accident. Went to Dr's appt in the same strip mall and saw it so had to walk in. I did not know there were any indie Scrapbooking places left anymore. They have been open for about a year and a half. The things that struck me about this place were; the unique paper selection, (I loved the Rock a Bye Baby and weirdo Alice in Wonderland paper),  the fact they take Groupon, and the owner and employee are the best! I was made to feel very valued shopping here.And as we all know that doesn't happen at the (cough, cough) competition. I hate shopping for crafts nowadays because the customer service is so bad. I think I will drive out of my way to return here and maybe take a class or two.  Did I mention how nice the owner is? lol! She really is a gem. I had such a nice conversation with her and her store employee. They actually also gave me a really good idea on a project I have been mulling over in my mind and how to do it. They coincidentally had the same idea more or less and made a  very nice wall hanging. I liked their idea way better than how I was going to do it. Thanks guys!  And Yelpers check it out. It is a smaller store with a limited selection, no yarn, and they do have some pottery items too."
0,"The toppings bar is what drags down this location. I do not expect everything to be fresh off the truck, but it was obvious that most were frozen and thawed out in a rush. The mangoes sat in this thick syrupy sauce that was completely unappetizing. The blueberries were shriveled up and dry. With the high volume of pre or post movie attendees, I would expect them to have a better turn over rate. \n\nThe only good things about this place was the worker and the watermelon sorbet. I normally don't like watermelon flavored anything, but my sister talked me into it and I did not regret it."
1,"Been here twice and it's been so very nice! Both times, the staff have been very kind and the food have been great. I'll definitely go back here."
0,"Went for dinner on Saturday night and knew we were in for a long night as there was no hostess or coordination at the front of the house. Reservations for 2 at 7:30 and were virtually ignored until around 8:00 after inquiring a couple of times about the table. So no big deal - glad to see that they were busy in this economy, etc.\n\nMixed bag on the food/service. French onion soup was top-notch as usual...the green tomato stack was below average and flavorless...stuffed chicken and mashed potatoes were average, but I think I just made a bad order and wasn't in the mood for steak frites which looked pretty good (also they were already out of two menu items pork and lamb). My sister got mussels w/ white whine and rosemary which were pretty good, but was disappointed that there was no good, crusty french bread to dip into the jus. Fries came with that, and while not a french fry person, these were excellent. Service was spotty with the issues in the beginning and no-return on refills later in the dinner. I would give it a 2.5 if this site alllowed for 1/2 ratings...but lean toward 2 stars considering the whole experience."
0,Their service absolutely stinks.. Food is always brought out cold. The Biscuits that come with gravy were HARD as a rock. I didn't enjoy the breakfast because the entire time everyone else was eating and I was waiting for something that shouldn't of been hard and cold in the first place. Really not the best breakfast and its false advertising to say so. Two thumbs down...
0,"Well, what can I say.  Wow!  This was the WORST restaurant experience that I have had in my 43 years on this earth.  I am not exaggerating.  It was very, very painful.\n\nIt started with the hostess.  A \""5-10\"" minute wait was all, she said.  25 minutes later we discovered that she had mistakenly crossed out our names.  OK, no problem, mistakes happen, we understand.  She says we get the next 2 person table.  Cool.  As we are waiting, I notice a couple being seated that came in much after us.  After some questioning, she allegedly crossed out their names too.  Umm, really???  The girl had no clue.\n\nFinally got seated and the waitress tells us the kitchen is backed up and to be patient.  OK, we are patient.  We order our food, a spicy chicken sandich and a tuna sandwich.  As we are waiting, and waiting, and waiting, we hear the waitress scolding customers.....\""I told you if you didn't order right away it would take longer, you chose to wait.  Really????   At another table she says the same thing.  The table next to us, once they get their food, complain and leave without even touching it.  Oh my!!!!\n\nApparently the kitchen is small and can't handle a crowd.  The 2 sandwiches mentioned above, took 70 minutes to get to us.....YES! 70 MINUTES!!!!!!!!  I can't believe we waited that long.  We were so mad, but at some point we were too invested.\n\nOnce the food comes.....no chips.  They will be along in a bit but they were not ready yet.  Really!!!!?????\n\nThe food was decent, no complaints there.  Every single table, though, was mad and upset about the wait.  It was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant, and I eat out A LOT!\n\nAnyway, stay away from this place.  They don't deserve your business.  This, by the way, is also the first \""bad\"" review I have ever written.. They should be ashamed!"
0,"It is unfortunate that my husband and I won't be ordering from there again, since we got excited when we discover another Chinese restaurant that is around our neighborhood. We ordered the spicy garlic chicken; curry beef; seafood hot and sour soup and garden vegetable with fried rice and the complimentary white rice for take-out one night and we both got sick the next day with diarrhea!!! The food was not fresh and super salty, which was so gross."
0,"Check the expiration dates! This location is notorious for having expired stock. It's poorly staffed & the few times I've brought expired items up front, I've been confronted with staff that were not the least bit interested. I avoid shopping here."

0,I've had General Tso. Wow. I hated it.
0,"If I could give it zero stars I would!  This isn't the friendliest place in town.  Sure, it was close to our house but never again will I set foot in this nasty place.  Our first interaction with the owner was him making fun of Americans, that was why they have the \""diner special\"" posted all over the restaurant.   I felt very uncomfortable the second I walked in there.  It felt as if he just saw dollar signs when he would glance at my wife and I.  \n\n\nOn to the food.... Horrible, just horrible, I ordered the Shrimp Lo-mein.  To my surprise the food came out really quick!  The second he put the plate of hot mess in front of my face the smell almost started my gag reflex. Now I knew why it had come so fast.  The mixture of noodle, canned mushrooms, cabbage, snow peas, bamboo shoots and whatever else they had thrown in the mix with the shrimp all had burn marks on them.  It looked like they had only stirred the mixture only once, then let the one side just sit in the pan until they smelt it burn, ding, the timer was done.\n\n The smell of burnt food actually ended up being the taste of the whole meal!  Now, I am one who will have the waiter take back the plate of food if it is not up to eatable standards but in this case I didn't want to have to fight with this guy about how horrible this plate of crap was.  I nibbled on what looked eatable then we quickly packed our left overs, paid and left, the closes garbage can we found we threw the food away.\n\nI'm not quite sure why or if we ordered the right thing but I can't figure out why this place is getting highish reviews on Yelp.  How this place is still open in that matter.  I say turn around and run from this place.  Go try a different hole in the wall."
0,"Just gave this place a second try and I am even more disappointed than I had been the first time. Same horrendous service, soggy fries, and mediocre wings. What really put the cherry on the cake was the \""thug\"" cashier who was told 3 times that I wanted my order to go and he brought it to me as if I were eating-in. When I corrected him he began to roll his eyes and start huffing and puffing. No seriously, he looks like he is thirty. The food was just as bad. Soggy fries and tiny burnt wings that tastes like rubber, yeah no thanks. I am not sure what people like about this place but I guess it's good enough to impress a bunch of frat guys at the ASU campus nearby. If you appreciate quality service and good food don't waste your time here."
0,We will never take our dog here again! We scheduled an appointment and dropped her off on time. We called 2 1/2 hours later because we hadn't heard anything from them and we were told they had not even started yet! When she was finally done (4 hours after original appt.) the cut was FAR from worth the wait. The groomer was very rude and we didn't get any sort of apology for the wait. NEVER AGAIN!!
1,I had a unique problem and lost all of my information from my phone. Alberto Beccerra spent hours fixing my phone even though he did not have to. Other people in the store did not want to help me but Alberto  did everything he could to help me. Thanks to Alberto everything is back on my phone and everything is working better than it was before thank you very much Alberto I appreciate you.
0,"Very disappointed....would not go back.  Should have been able to tell by lack of customers on a Thursday night.  Tried two of the more popular dishes and neither really struck me as something I would come back for.  Hardly any meat, very small portions and the large bug on the wall behind me didn't do anything for my appetite.  Would rather pay more at Basil or head to Cuisine Malaya for my fix"
0,"I'm an avid shopper at Ulta. Every time I've come in here to look, etc. employees are rude and on top of me the entire time. The reason it deserves one star is because I was here before Christmas a few years ago with my mom (shopping for my daughter) and I had a police man usher me and two other women to the back of the store. They made us empty our pockets, purses, etc. and we're extremely rude to all of us. They accused us all of being in cahoots with each other and planning to shoplift... I'd never even seen the women before! I was shaken up and very upset. But still very polite to manager and said I understood she was just looking out for the store and she was unbelievably rude and brushed me aside instead apologizing greatly, as she should have. Little did she know I was probably going to spend 100$+ on Christmas gifts! Very unfortunate because two or three of the girls here are angels and amazing helpers."
1,"As part of the Yelp Spring Break Pub Crawl in downtown LV, I stopped into Vanguard for the first time. I'd walked by it in the past but it looked almost empty that I wasn't quite sure what to expect.\n\nI'm so glad I finally tried it. The bartender was awesome and made me the most complex and yet mind-blowing cocktail I'd ever had (it was a Cucumber, Burnt Rosemary Gin drink). I'll definitely go back for happy hour. Glad I added another bar to my downtown favorites!"
0,"We brought our Small chihuahua mix here for a cut, they're usually good but last time the groomer gave her a small cut on her elbow. They took her into the vet located in the store and gave her a free checkup, thankfully it was nothing serious and didn't get any infection. Still kinda uneasy about taking her back. Think I'll give it one more shot..... just got a call she got cut AGAIN.. last time I take my dog here.."
0,I brought a pair of earrings for my mother for Mother Day. And today I am in Store because they broke. They said that they could not exchange and\nNo refunds. They will try to Fix. After I get My\nMother earring I will never shop here again. Very rude
1,"I can say that I have never eaten a delicious omelet and pancakes, the good reviews here, but I can only confirm fully. Try the juices and the Cafe I highly recommend. The restaurant is small and far from spacious, but also what gives it its charm."
1,"The best florist in Charlotte. Karisa is a one of a kind. Creative and kind and thoughtful. She understands her clients and knows exactly what to do. Her creations will blow your mind. If you don't call her for your wedding, you are a fool-you will look just like every other wedding or bouquet of flowers out there with no thought or sentiment behind it. \nSo call Nectar. Be original"
1,"Yay for SPG Restaurant Month with a special priced 3-course prix fixe menu! It just made more sense to try out this new place in the valley and I was happy for the decision :)\n\nUpon arrival to the restaurant, we took a spot at the self-parking and took a small walk into the resort and it was so worth it, you can feel the quietness and relaxation! The restaurant is at the lower level of the main lobby, we opted to walk down the stairway instead of taking the elevator. Reservation was confirmed with the host and we were taken to our table, very modern and contemporary design, with Latin American music in the air, very romantic if that is the occasion.  And we were not surprised there were only a few tables, I bet everyone else  was in front of their TV watching the super bowl.\n\nNow it's food!\n\nTwo appetizers - we were recommended by the waiter to have a warm dish and a cold dish, and our choices took the Millionaire Taco and the Squash Blossom Tetilla Quesadilla. Both were very tasty as well as nicely presented, especially the tacos! They were so cute at looking and so delicious at taste! Mixed lobster, ahi tuna and hamachi meat with a chipotle mayo-ish sauce scooped into a small crunchy yuca chip, hmmm, can i have some more? The quesadilla was warm and the cheese was just melting, it's not the typical tortilla you would have, not sure what it is called, but this ones were thinner and attracted a bit of more oil...\n\nTwo entrees - \n+Pan seared Mahi Mahi on top of a light broth with some shrimps, shaved calamari and some peas, it also came with a spoonful of freshly grained chili pepper and amarath for some extra spiciness. The dish looked very healthy and pretty with different colors, tasty yet I couldn't say a lot about the freshness of the fish, or the other tastes just stole the fish. \n+'Kobe vaca encebollada' - grilled kobe skirt steak with a strong tomato based sauce on the top, paired with some purple potato with egg and guacamole. The sauce has a mixture flavor of sweet and spicy, and also a little sour? It's definitely not how you eat your typical steak, but be a bit adventurous and see what you think? \n\n-Two desserts - We felt like this was the final show and you see it! The chocolate cigar and the flan (?) with some fresh berries. They even made a couple of little matches with the cigar! and of course they are all edible! The 'cigar' was made of dark chocolate and very rich, paired with some coffee/caramel ice cream was just heavenly!\n\nOverall our dining experience was a joy. Our waiter was nice and attentive, also knowledgeable about what came to our table. All of the food were delicious with nice presentations, we can't say if these are your authentic Latin food as we are no pro. Definitely a good 'hidden' place for a special occasion!"
0,"This show is definitely overrated.  It is nothing like a Cirque show, which was the comparison I got from everyone.  It is definitely more of a comedy/acrobatic act, with a lot of sexual innuendo. \n\nSome of the jokes were funny, but they were all sexual and racist, nothing creative or new.  The guy's assistant Penny is adorable how she acts and the way she talks. \n\nOverall the show wasn't anything special, most of the acts you can see at PH Variety Show.  The seating was very uncomfortable and tight.  The tent was decorated well to the theme, but I still wouldn't recommend this show.  Didn't think it was worth $80."
1,"Excellent food and service.  For an appetizer, the falafel dish was tasty and I followed that up with the chicken kabob entree.  A friend of mine was also very pleased with the veggie combo 1 dinner.\n\nThe wait staff was very courteous and I'm guessing it was the owner that came over and asked us how the dinner was going."
1,"My chips weren't stale at all.  And the salsa was great.\nThey smiled very happily through my fathers very, very broken spanish and responded with sweet things he didn't remotely understand.  \nThe service was quick and courteous - not in a lingering, fake-friendly way, which I appreciate.  They had a lot of fresh veggie and grilled items not typically found on your run of the mill mexican menu.  My food was well done and everyone I was with was happy as well - even my parents who can be picky.  Will absolutely go back."
0,"It  Only Took About 15~20 MIns To be Seated for 4 people  even though the Place was Packed like Sardeines . Well We were seated and were ignoerd for about 5~10 Mins than the waitress came took the Drink Orders Then never came back for like 5~10 min than the assisant manager was walking by FAST we said Politely \"" Excuse us we R Ready to Order . and Totaly IGNORE like she Pressed A Facebook Button . Than The Prices were like going to A fancy Restrant .than after 15~20 Mins we decide to get up and get GOING than right from rising they come with the drinks and when we walked away They gave the rudest Smurk and i forgot the head waitress rolled her eyes after telling her we were ready to Order  this was after one of the 2 assisant Managers IGNORED US ! Well every one was starring at us in Suprize or something and the 2nd assiant manager and the Manager/ Boss Whatever came to us and said we r sorry we will knock off 50% your Bill . Well a few of my family members said NO . Thanks and walked out . Thats the story ! :) :("
1,"Good smoothies, nice staff, a decent atmosphere, and decent food make Indie Coffee a good destination in the Regent area.\n\nIn terms of smoothies, they're good because they're actually smooth and all have a good bit of tang to them that I enjoy. In terms of atmosphere, it's pretty mellow, but has some hints of a music theme going. When you enter, you see some covers to popular albums, although those cuts don't at all say \""INDIE\"" to you. One fun thing I liked is that their drink sizes are in 3 sizes: Wingra, Monona, and Mendota. It's little things like that that give it a good local zest. In terms of food, I can't say anything about their waffles, but that's just because i'm not a waffle guy and haven't had them. But i've had several of their sandwiches. The honey/fig/goat cheese is good if you have a bit of a sweet tooth. The pesto egg focaccia, grilled cheese bagel, and veggie cheese focaccia are all also good choices. They're all pretty reasonably priced too, at just $5-7. I would recommend against the mediterranean wrap however. That one is just incredibly soggy and messy, and the hummus they use in it is a bit disappointing.\n\nAnd one final note: They have an outdoor area in the back when weather permits, and it's usually nice. However, the last time I ate outside there, there were bees hanging about, and they were REALLY attracted to the honey/fig/goat cheese sandwich I ordered. Pretty unpleasant, but i'm sure this isn't a frequent occurrence there."
0,"The worst mini-golf possibly ever created. You could build a better, more fun, and more challenging one in your driveway with some paper cups and the garden hose. However, the driving range is nice, the arcade acceptable, and the go karts are cool. I don't care about the volleyball courts, but they have some there if you want to play volleyball while watching the looks of disappointment on the children after they finish the five minute speed golfing."
0,"Booked tee time on executive course through the pro shop for this morning.  Was quoted $29 for \""cub course\"" and $39 for \""bear course\"".  When arrived was told that  cub course was walking only due to the rain.  I have no problem with that.   I asked if bear course was open to carts and told yes.  Went to pay for bear course and it was almost 60 per person.   I stated that I was quoted $39 and was told by the guy in the pro shop that \""they haven't had $39 rates for months\"".  I said ok and went ahead and paid.  Before we teed off I looked online on the courses actual website and low and behold it was $39 for a tee time starting in 10 minutes. I went back to the pro shop and showed it to the guy in the pro shop.  He started to totally back track on his statement about not having $39 rates.  In the end he still would not honor the $39 rate.  Stating that was only for \""online tee times\"".  \n\nIf that was the case why didn't he tell me that those rates are online only.  Either the guy in the pro shop doesn't know what he is talking about or is very misinformed.   Either way very disappointed. \n\nSigned,\n\nChandler Resident"
1,"Though the name may imply it, the Thin Man Sandwich shop is not a diet sandwich shop serving veggie pitas and bowls of steam. This joint is serving high quality, cheffed out sandwiches that are packed with flavor.\n\nI had the beef shank sandwich with horseradish mayo, whole grain mustard, and shaved fennel and celery. This sandwich was the perfect combo of savory fattiness from the beef shank, sharpness from the mayo and mustard, and crunchy freshness from the fennel and celery salad. Slap all of those great flavors inside a crunchy/chewy Breadworks baguette and you will be in for treat.\n\nMy only complaint about this shop is that it the service can be a little slow. I stopped in here on a Saturday morning around 11, there were three other people in the shop, and it took about 10 minutes from when I placed my order to when I received my sandwich. A gentleman came in after me, ordered 1 sandwich to go and it took him about 10 minutes as wells to received his order. I know they just opened and I'm sure they are still working the kinks out. Hopefully the wait time will be cut down in the future. That being said the wait was well worth it, the sandwich rocked."
1,My favorite PF Changs. Always really good food and friendly service. Love the lettuce wraps and Hot and Sour Soup.
1,Good new breakfast spot! It is understandably busy on the weekends but they do get tables sat as quickly as possible. My wife ordered the Eggs Benedict and could have easily ordered a half order because the portions are very generous! I had a made to order omelet that was very tasty and portion heavy too.\n\nIf you live in the are and want breakfast I would recommend the Good Egg for done in or carry out.
0,"Here's the low-down:   They are definitely a must at Texas Station if you're a night-owl and love steak and hamburgers! They serve breakfast all day, every day.  Their pastries are reasonably priced, tasty and they are rather large for the money.  Aside from these things, you're better off going to Denny's, iHop or the Feast Buffet only a few feet past the Starbucks farther into the casino area.  I say this because the portions are plenty for whatever food you get - as it fills your plate! - but the breakfast I received was anything by great.\n\n  It didn't take two long for my boyfriend and I to get a table.  The blonde hostess was polite but definitely not very up-beat or \""smile-y\"".  Being an ex-hostess myself, I realize how important it is to be very happy, enthusiastic and charismatic - it really sets the mood more than you would think. Nevertheless, I didn't feel very welcome and again, it was just \""blah\"".  This cafe is not big at all from what I could see at the time of the day we arrived!  It's no wonder other Yelpers complain about the wait, the place is actually pretty small.  It's a little disorienting because I believe they block off half of the restaurant early in the day for some odd reason or another - I can only assume they open the place up for dinner and \""nightlight\"" dining. \n\n  Anyway, on to the good bits, we got Mercedes who is by far the best waitress in the entire restaurant!  She was very sweet and she took the initiative to strike up a small conversation between us ordering, us waiting for food and once we actual began to eat.  It was a kind gesture and it made our experience better - we definitely felt more comfortable than initially waiting for a table, if you know what I mean.\n\n  I ended up ordering coffee and orange juice for the drinks, the boyfriend just getting a water.  I went for the three egg veggie omelette with green bell pepper, mushrooms and spinach.  It comes with hash browns which is nice and for some reason it comes with a plethora of toast? I had FOUR slices on my plate.  Mercedes asked me if I wanted cheese on my omelette and I of course nodded, assuming she wanted my preference of cheese so I told her.  Little did I know, they charged us for it!  It was about two extra dollars added to the bill that was completely unnecessary. On top of it all, I also got a side of bacon - this was a terrible idea.  I asked how much it would be and Mercedes told me it would be $3.49.  That's right, almost $4 for FOUR slices of bacon!  Once I ordered it, I ate once slice but then crumbled the rest on my omelette.  In doing so by coincidence, Mercedes comes to the table a little later, saying that if she knew I wanted to do that, she could have added bacon to the omelette for only $.99!  Really, people?!  I feel like my wallet was violated for no apparent reason whatsoever.  Don't they already get enough of my wallet when I use the blasted Slot machines?\n\n\n  The boyfriend ended up getting the breakfast bowl.  It came with scrambled eggs, hash browns, white gravy and a small biscuit on top.  My omelette was beautifully made, but completely and totally tasteless and bland.  I had to put more than four shakes of salt on it with pepper AND Tabasco sauce for it to even taste semi-desirable.  The boyfriend's meal was \""okay\"" as he put it.  I didn't try a bite but taking a small taste of the biscuit, it was dry.  Apparently the gravy they used gave his eggs and hash browns a taste but that is more than likely the case because of the sodium content in it.  This is actually the reason why I'm giving Grand Cafe a two out of five stars - the breakfast food is so iffy, you may or may not even get something tasty!  \n\n  Remember how I said I got an orange juice and coffee?  I mentioned that for a reason.  Because BOTH of these things cost us an extra $3.00 EACH.  Yes, you heard that right.  A three dollar cup of Joe. Bottom line here: always ask the waitress how much extras and sides cost and DO NOT expect a cheap meal here.  The family next to us in a booth ordered hamburgers and apparently, as I heard them tell their waitress, was phenomenal.  Too bad we didn't get a slice of that cloud 9 they were on because when we looked at how much we owed after all was said and done, we were very disgruntled.  Mercedes was a great waitress which is why I'm giving this Cafe TWO STARS instead of one.  \n\nVisitors and hotel guests of Texas Station, go elsewhere for food!"
0,"I hate to give a 1 star but I had to. I'm Filipino and was really looking forward to trying this place out and was even rooting for their success but all they left me with is a bad 1st impression and an empty belly. I got there at 5:00 and they closed that day at 7:00, I tried ordering 3 different things and they were out of everything. Then the lady tried pawning off their BBQ for chicken adobo like as if I didn't know the difference. I guess they wanted me to pick from the 3 selections they had under the hot lamp that looked as if it had been there since noon. Ended up driving 30 min to Glendale and went to \""halo-halo\"" which was pretty good! I will not be returning to manilla sunrise and will make the extra trip farther to halo halo. Consider yourself warned and you can't believe everything you read in the new times."

0,"I went to this shop today in hopes of killing some time in between errands. When I walked in a was greeted with a half-hearted \""hello\"". It was an after thought. No one entered the humidor to ask if I need assistance. When I went to pay for my cigar I was not asked if I was going to stay and smoke it. The clerk simply bagged the cigar. He interrupted his conversation with another employee to ask me if I wanted a receipt and that was it.  I felt very unwelcome; almost as if I was intruding. Won't be going back."
0,"Nice friendly....but is that to hid something.\n\nWent in at about 9Pm on Saturday June 8th to get a smog on my vehicle.  I was told that it did not pass smog, but the person behind the counter could not tell me what the code meant why I did not pass smog, but if I wanted to bring it back for $94.00 I could bring it back tomorrow and they could put it on their machine and tell me what was wrong with it. I went home and contacted a friend who said the code on my failed smog was for a break light switch.....what the hell does my brakes have to do with my emissions. So Sunday we went to the car was at Charleston and Torrey Pines that also does smog....GUESS WHAT.....my vehicle passed smog without a hitch,  Do not go to Sun Valley Automotive,,,,,if you do and you don't pass get a second opinion. I wonder what they would have said if I let them put it on their machine.   Nice waiting room, but I guess they have to make money somewhere to pay for it"
0,Really cool lights at the fair tonight look to the north and see such a delight.\nWell last night was the last day of the fair is closed it's gone now for next year but they will be the next fair in the spring.
1,"Just a small counter located just inside O'Sheas Casino, you can get pretty good discounts on just about any show or exhibit in Vegas (for that same day; thus the name).  They have several other locations as well, but this one just happened to be the most convenient.  There's usually a line, and you have to wait outside in the sun, but they have employees that try to help you decide on shows while you wait.  They'll try to sell you discounts on restaurants as well.\n\nFive stars for helping us save some dough, minus one star for making us wait outside in the desert heat."
0,Have been going here for years but recently they changed a few menu items and policies:( \nThey no longer offer kids options for food so your forced to purchase a $26 dollar meal for a child.\nThey also charge you extra for substituting  a veg instead of mashed potatoes. They feel mashed potatoes are a garnish for the steak or fish.\nBandera your in the hospitality business!\nI won't be back. What a shame!
1,"Ok, here's what we know about me. 1. I want to move into retail spaces. (just at night :) ) 2. I am a Gabi K wannabe and pretty much love everything she does. This leads me to Salon Ami, actually hair stylist extrordinaire Ashely Scott. I have been having trouble finding someone that can 1) blow dry my naturally curly uber thick italian mop so I dont look like a mushroom head and 2) can highlight my hair without frying my hair off or making me look like some hybrid breed of a bengal tiger. So, I went to Gabi K's \""girl\"" and OH MY GOD!!! She is magic. My hair has never looked better. She did some corrective work on my color and it didnt take 6 hours (yes, I have actually sat that long) and the cut is so stylish Jennifer Anniston would be jealous. \nThank you Gabi K THANK YOU!"
1,"What can I say...This place has it all! From the ambiance, service, food, and drinks! They serve up the BEST guacamole table side as you choose what you would like put in it and how spicy you would like it. The Pork Belly Pibil is a signature dish that many of my friends have recommended and is the Grilled Street Corn (One of my favorites!) and Green Chile Duck Confit. If you like dessert you def have to try the pumpkin cake with vanilla ice cream! I sometimes go here just for that!"
1,"This is a good little spot. The coffee was delicious; my wife had a peach mimosa that she really liked.  It buzzed her up good.  I had the French toast and my wife had a Mediterranean omelet and they were both tasty.  The French toast was some of the best French toast I have ever had, the butter was awesome.  It was a really good meal and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  So now that I have recommended Over/Easy based only on the food, I have to commend the manager for taking care of his customers.  I bought this living social coupon without reading the fine print, my bad, I'm sure we've all been there, and I wasn't supposed to be able to use it at the Gilbert Over/Easy, the coupon was for the Mesa Over/Easy.  I explained that I came all the way from Phoenix because I couldn't use my living social at the Phoenix Over/Easy and Jeff, the manager worked with me and applied a credit to my bill even though it was my mistake.  That's quality service that will keep me coming back.  I just had to let folks know, the food was good and that is the most important but the service was accommodating even though I was in the wrong and that's something every service oriented business should provide  Be good to people who keep the business going and they will come back.  Good food, great service.  I'll definitely be back."
0,"No no no! Our first day/night our a/c wasn't working and so it was hot. Then every night we stayed there including the first, when we pulled back, what was supposed to be, clean bed sheets we found hair! And not any hair, pubic hair! Omg...*gag*...there were like 4 or 5 of them! Also the sheets had these yellowish stains from overuse. It was disgusting. And to make matters worse my boyfriend kept breaking out in hives in the morning! When we finally checked out I talked to the guy behind the counter who said all he could do was return the resort's fees. I may end up contacting Hotwire and see about getting a refund. Ugh. Never again with this place!"
1,"I've stayed here a few times and have always enjoyed it.  But I will tell you, that you can hear the thump thump thump of the music being played at the pool and clubs till 4 am in the morning, so be cautions of what side of the building you stay.\n\nThe rooms are remarkable, clean and modern.  It's a big place, and they offer tons of stuff for almost any demographic.  Put on your walking shoes, because it's a big place and you'll be on your feet a lot.  Hope you enjoy it here as much as we did."
1,"So amazing!\n\nImpeccable wine list. I am a Malbec (usually Argentina) fan but also am in love with Italian Merlots. This particular evening I had a french Malbec- Yes! French! My first time trying a French Malbec. It was so divine. I closed my eyes and savored every sip! The nose, the velvety smoothness.......The sommilier looked at me like I was crazy when after sampling it, I said I could taste licorice and bubblegum notes but that is just what this beautiful unique wine tasted like- in a good way of course. The only sad part is that I cannot remember the name of the wine...please if anyone knows send me a comment!\n\nFor the main course I ordered the Venison Chop which was so delicate and perfectly cooked that it melted in your mouth. I grew up eating venison and have never tasted anything so wonderful. My husband ordered the surf and turf: Aged Prime Beef Strip Sirloin with Butter Poached Lobster. We almost didn't talk the entire meal because it was so delicious!\n\nWe had a table right on the window overlooking the Bellagio water show which went off every 15 min! The view of the strip is fabulous and romantic. It was just perfect. \n\nThe service is amazing and you are treated like royalty! Can't wait to go back!"
0,"My fianc\u00e9 and I were here for dinner last week, as we are looking for a place to have a nice dinner reception following our small wedding in a few months, annnnd...\n\nI'm sorry, but if I'm spending $60+ on a steak, I expect to get it how I ordered it. I should have read Yelp reviews beforehand, but if their version of \""medium\"" is code for \""still breathing\"", they should let guests know. \n\nService was great, and everything else would have probably made me want to go back for more, but...no."
0,"Lots of TVs, and good food. They have an expansive beer selection, and I was smart enough to do a beer flight. OOOOhhhh yeahhhh. It was great. The oysters here tasted fresh too. \n\nThe place was crowded but my friend and I were able to be seated rather quickly. I had the New Amsterdam Burger. It was okay, but not memorable. it was practically a Reuben burger, which i've had before at another restaurant. The place can be a bit loud.\n\nOverall its a nice place next to the Aria. But I think for the price i've had better joints."
0,"I spent eight nights in the Las Vegas Hotel for business.  Because of how the reservations worked out, I was in one room in the North Tower for four nights and one room in the Central Tower for four nights.  Those were totally different worlds.\n\nIN GENERAL:\nThe front desk area was nice, but there was almost always a wait for check-in, key pick-up, etc.  The front desk staff varied from nice to end-of-my-shift-grumpy.  They have a \""Go Green\"" program, which I thought was kinda cool.  If you don't want your room cleaned, press the \""Go Green\"" button on your phone and they'll slide a $10 hotel voucher under your door in the morning.  Score!  You can also check out from your room phone, which saved us some time.  \n\nWorst Paper Products Ever.  I know hotels aren't going to buy lovely Cottonelle and Puffs Plus for their rooms, but I'm not sure which was worse: the medium-grade sand paper tissues or the toilet paper that disintegrated on contact.  I never smelled cigarette smoke in the rooms, but every one of us got stuffed up noses the minute we walked in our rooms all week.  Something about the ventilation in the hotel is not right.  Also, there was a daily fee for WiFi access.  Boo hiss.  \n\nNORTH TOWER:\nI apparently got an upgraded room, which came with an extra sitting area.  There was a fridge, a nice tv, a couch, a couple of chairs, and a coffee table.  A colleague got a non-upgraded room across the hall, which was identical without the extra sitting area.  The room was super clean.  Everything looked pretty new, the carpet was in great condition, and the tile in the entryway and bathroom was gleaming.  Bathroom had a full-sized hair dryer and a garden tub.  Bed was super comfy, as part of the upgrade is an upgraded pillow-top mattress.  Other than the ventilation playing havoc with my sinuses, this was a great room.\n\nCENTRAL TOWER:\nObviously built before the North Tower, this wing has seen better days long ago.  The bedding seemed clean and the bed was comfy enough, but the room had a general \""ick\"" feel to it.  The carpet was very worn and stained.  There were a couple of used tissues on the floor behind the bathroom trash can.  The shower head was broken and flopped down, so I had to crouch and duck under it to wash.  No fridge.  It just felt old, outdated, and worn out.  It was like being in a totally different hotel.\n\nI'd stay in the North Tower again if it were a good deal.  I wouldn't go back to the Central Tower."
0,"I had a series of 3 spinal injections w no pain relief. Why? Because dr Houston  misdiagnosed me. This TOCA group is supposed to be a sports medicine group. If that was the case then he should have had no problem diagnosing this run, tennis player, over all athlete who has never stretched in his life with a negative MRI with periformis syndrome! I suffered for over a YEAR while he gladly wrote pain medicine scripts. Fortunately for me my CPA brother in law diagnosed me and showed me some extremely effective stretches. This is condition which is classic in triathletes not that I was ever examined because I doubt that pays as we'll. overall feeling like bad practice. And yes he's got a terribly arrogant bedside manner and clearly doesn't evaluate his patients adequately."
1,"Great convenient location for my favorite Asian food. The food is generally good the only thing negative I have to say is sometimes the tofu can come out soggy but most of the time it is crisp and delicious. My favorite dish is the sesame chicken with fried rice. The staff here is always friendly and they have freestyle coca cola machines at this location! Would recommend for anyone looking for fast, fresh, and tasty Asian food."
1,Nothing special beyond the expectations of a truck stop with the exception of the racing fuel they carry
1,"Very good greasy-spoon Mexican place.  My husband and I both had margaritas, and they were great- not too sweet, nice amount of salt.  Make sure you look at all of the options- we ordered \""fresh\"" which uses fresh lime juice.  They have tons of tequila choices.  Nachos we shared were good, and the small order was more than enough for two of us.\n\nMy husband had the mixed fajitas, and enjoyed them.  Portion was huge, and we brought about half of it home. I had the pozole and Alex taco.  Both were flavorful.  Pozole had a nice amount of spice.  \n\nWe'll return."
0,So go thru the drive thru and get ignored. No one answers then decide ok I will go inside. Once inside the only person in the place doesn't acknowledge I am there while he is making good and I am there at the counter waiting 20 min and not one word. WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!
1,"I was there for dinner. It was almost empty on the weekday night I went. Food was good particularly the salad. Service was attentive though only one waiter. Nice environment. Located in a mall, difficult to find. Prices reasonable. Good place for Arabic food."
1,Amazing honey BBQ sauce.  Wings wet and crispy.  Great atmosphere.  I can't imagine going anywhere else for wings.
1,"The hotel was very clean and super comfy, We got upgraded instantly, and the staff was amazing with the amount of crap they were getting from 4 young ladies who didn't go through the proper channels to book a room. The buffett was one of the best I have ever been to in vegas and the winning didn't hurt neither."
1,"This was the first time I watched Cirque Du Soleil and I have to say I was in awe.\nI have always seen the commercials and the little videos playing all over Las Vegas but I have never seen one until last Sunday.\n\nFirst of all, the service is great. They lead you well and are extremely friendly. \nI paid around $69 dollars for a seat third row from the back. It was quite far, but we didn't mind. \n\nHonestly, for this show, I think it's better to get a seat in the back. We were able to get a center seat so we can watch when the acrobats came down from the ceiling.\n\nThe dancing, acting, and acts were all amazing and beautiful. The music complemented the dancing well and so did the funny acting! The whole audience was laughing and cheering. The stunts were gorgeously performed and the dancing was beautiful.\n\nA must see if you're in Las Vegas. Definitely worth the money."
1,"This was the best pizza I've ever had. Homemade lamb sausage, roasted eggplant and peppers.\n\nI are at a random time so the restaurant was empty. My server was very nice and helpful with the menu."
1,This is one of the better boba places around Chinatown. I usually get a watermelon smoothie and it is definitely fresh watermelon. The dried prunes and such are great. The spicy dried guava is my favorite. The service and boba is usually pretty consistent for me. No complaints.
0,"Was at the Excalibur for Memorial day weekend (5 days total). Check in easy enough, however we were told we were getting a free upgrade! Lol carpet stained, smelled bad, beds were hard as rocks! Could have sworn it was a box spring. Sheets and pillows were filthy stained as well as the towels.  View was of the roof. Staff still enters room with privacy tag up to change linens with more stained linens. And no wi-fi had to hit up starbucks to get a signal. Who doesn't have wi-fi? Everywhere else had wi-fi.\n\n    Leavin tower every day we were harassed by people trying to sell time shares and dicount show tickets that were crap. (They say free but they are not.) Big scam. Every day it was same people and same pitch. Unrelenting\n\n     We did breakfast buffet,  unimpressive. And way overpriced. Had upset stomach the entire day after eating that food. It was all bland. Would have been better off eating mcdonalds every day. \n    \n     Gambling in Excalibur cocktail waitresses we're non existent,  but when you got one they were abrasive and by comparison of the other casinos very old and unattractive and rude to match. \n\n     The large pool was closed all but one day! But they kept the adult pool that you have to pay $10+ to get into open with 3 patrons (4 lifeguards). I would say bad idea. Drinks were super expensive bring at least $40 cash with you to drink at the pool. \n\n     I will probably never stay at the Excalibur again it is out dated and under staffed to keep up on the hotel and casino. This will contribute to further deterioration of the casino. (Resort fee?) Ha what resort? Small uprade to motel 6 but with a casino inside."
1,"Boyfriend took his recently purchased used Mercedes here for some work. When we returned to pay, they admitted they had made a huge mistake with their quote. They had under quoted by$ 500!! They forgot to add labor and 1 part. HOWEVER, they stayed true to their quote. But, my generous boyfriend paid in full. He said he knew they would be fair to him in the future....let's hope so! Great work ladies! Car runs great."
1,Wife and I had the lunch buffet.  The food was outstanding everything was awesome especially the rice dish.  The food has some similarities to Northern Indian food so it seemed familiar to me but different enough to intrigue me.  The only con was the bread which I guess is traditional but I found very dry.  We will go back for dinner for sure.
1,"After a long day of walking the strip, waiting for the 9:30 showing of Zarkana we were dreaming of a spot with good food and drink deals, hoping to not have to go back out in the cold and dying for a comfy chair. We turned the corner and found Social House - all of our dreams came true. A hefty list of food and drink specials til 8pm, great chill atmosphere, super comfortable chairs and couches in the lounge, fast service and a plug nearby to charge my phone! We tried 8 different items on the happy hour menu. My faves were the seaweed salad and angry tuna roll. Bronzed broccoli was perfectly cooked. Only the Thai beef lettuce cups disappointed - a little bland. Overall, a great find!"
1,Took my lady here for a surprise come about 5:45 pm cause it's  beautiful  to take pics and the weather is perfect. Had a amazing  experience  1st time  ever doing it and yes its a must. Your 450 feet in the air which is awesome. Looking for the locks for ur shoulders  lol only thing they use is a seatbelt and then your on your own lol awesome will  do it again. Local in vegas price cheap for ride and if visiting YES it's a must
1,"Went to visit Mike at Johnny B's about a month ago. I had been contemplating a quick clean up at Great Clips but decided to look for a higher quality alternative. Loved my experience at Johnny B's, and have been really happy with the haircut for 5 weeks now!"
0,"Definitely sucks\n\nBooked a 3 segment flight.  First and last segment refundable.  Middle segment non-refundable.  Paid extra.\n\nThey told me I couldn't make changes to my tickets because one of the segments was non-refundable and the most restrictive fare rules apply to the entire trip.  Wow.  So what was the benefit of paying extra for the other two segments?  Nothing.\n\nThen.  I guess to make up for it.  I was told I could cancel the segments I didn't want to use (2, I was going to rebook on Southwest) and keep the fare in an account for reuse - plus a $150 change fee of course.  Well it turns out I can only use that money to fly the EXACT SAME ROUTE ... not for a different trip on US Airways.  Fail.  \n\nThey can keep the money.  Consider it the cost of the lesson I learned which is that I will save much more time and money than what I had lost by never flying US Airways again."
0,"If there were less than 1 star, or negative stars, I'd rate it with that. I have been sitting here for upwards of 40 minutes and have not been approached once. I ordered my beer at the bar and then took a seat along the wall, and on two separate occasions the waitresses; two depicted in my attached photos, stood around socializing scanning the room, and conveniently not realizing I was sitting 10 feet away from them. So my glass is empty, no one has asked me if I would like an appetizer or a meal, and there are probably two or three other people with a quizzical look on there faces, wondering if someone will notice them too.  I wish I could have attached a picture of the time going by as I sit here with an empty glass and the table with no food on it.\n\nSo the girl depicted in my photograph finally approached me and then scolded me for having not followed whatever protocol they have for establishing a tab. Apparently if I bought a beer at the bar and then chose to sit down at a table I am prohibited from attaining any additional service.  It's the girl with her hair in a fountain style ponytail."
0,"I came here recently on my lunch break. The place is cute but tiny. Totally packed. Waited about 45 mins for my to go order, as I was leaving I noticed they left out 1/3 of my order! I had to go back and wait another 10 mins for the missing piece. That leaves 5 mins to eat and get back to work lol. I got a healthy Cobb salad that wasn't too tasty... But I did enjoy the mini cranturkey burger.  I wasn't the only one who had a bad experience this day... Lots of ppl waiting and very unorganized for call ahead orders.\n\nMaybe this was just a bad day... I will call ahead next time and give them another chance."
0,Store has been closed for over a week now.
1,"The house beans and bread alone are worth a visit.  My favorite items on the menu are the burrata, bruschetta, the fresca salad with gorgonzola honey dressing, the Sorrento pasta with shrimp and pink alfredo sauce, and the Amatriciana pasta (just a touch spicy).  Great date-night ambiance inside, and the patio area offers a casual option too."
0,"On my way home from work, I always walk by this place and I always see people walking into here.  So I decided to give it a shot and see what's up.  I'm not a health freak or a food guru nor am I picky about food but this place is just plain bad.  The $5/meal is pretty decent until they charge you an extra $2 for lo mein instead of rice.  But the biggest thing that bothers me is the huge puddle of oil that the food sits in.  Again, I'm not a health freak but eatting this food just made me feel guilty.  With every bite, I think about getting a heart attack at 27.  There's as much oil as there sauce and you see the thick oil floating above. don't expect a fantastic dining area either.  it's dark and feels icky.  \n\nI've had my fair share of cheap chinese food, and this is probably the worst I've tried."
0,They took out the table games and like half the machines to make room for pool tables and beer pong. And guess what? No on was playing. It used to be a fun place to play compared to the stuffy mega casios now its boring.
0,"I haven't been impressed with BJ's the last couple times I've visited and I'm not going back. I am newly gluten free and they have limited menu options for a GF person like me although I do appreciate that they offer a GF pizza. I can usually find something on a menu that will fit the bill so I ordered the Thai mango chicken salad. It was certainly nothing special considering the $12 price tag. I was disappointed to see that all their salads ran that much with the exception of the garden salad which was $9.75 + $3 extra to add grilled chicken. They've really increased their prices. My husband's vanilla Dr. Pepper was $3 and he was not offered a refill. So, like I said, I won't be returning."
0,"here is the deal,  do not ever waste your time or money with alex. we took a 1987honda elite 150 that ran,! he said we needed a new engine but afterward, we would have 'no problems' $750 later we drove away and made it less than a mile before it broke down. took it back, waited two days, got the scooter back and it ran for a day. he burned up the battery and we had to buy a new one which is useless now cause we have no scooter. alex is a pure piece of shit. his trashy woman is crap herself. i will never stop trying to put these scammers out of business. never even think of going to alex repair shop. peace"
0,"I was in the market for a black floral embossed belt (no giant buckle) I knew exactly what I wanted, but wanted to try it on first, and possibly support a local business rather than order one over the internet. Granted I do not look like the typical type of person who might frequent this establishment as; I'm white, I was wearing Lucky Jeans, a Locoste shirt, Chuck Taylors, and a Cardinals hat (I don't know how one would classify that look, I certainly didn't think criminal intent when I was dressing that morning).\n\nI walked in, scanned through the assortment of belts by the door, and then at the belts behind the counter, they were all slightly more \""attention grabbing\"" than I was looking for. I was asked if I needed help by the young lady at the register, I replied that I was good, I then walked out and got in my car to drive away. It was at this point that a large man rushed out the door behind me grimacing and angrily staring at my car as he wrote my license plate down. I put my car in reverse and asked him if I had done something wrong, he replied they had been robbed and I told him I had no criminal intent I was just looking for a belt. This didn't seem to placate the beast as he aggressively informed me he was forced to do this (like almost accusing me of being a potential robber and trying to intimidate me against the course of action).\n\nI don't know if this is the policy for all their customers or just any gringo's foolish enough to think they would be welcomed in this establishment. However the encounter was quite unsettling and I really would recommend you avoid this store unless you want to be made to feel like a criminal for no reason. Also for the record, I'm a medical professional and I make $30 an hr, THE LAST THING on my mind was robbing or stealing. Silly belts and supporting the local economy yes; robbing and stealing no."
1,"This is the first place in pittsburgh I've found that produces truly raw, fresh, cold pressed juices. There are shops like this all over LA, SF, and NY, but Pittsburgh is a little lacking. Or was until now. Their green juice is very smooth and super refreshing. It's a small space, but in San Francisco they sell juice out if little closets on the street. Definitely worth checking out!"
0,"I'm not quite sure how to rate Eatalia's. I feel like a 3 is generous, but 2 feels a bit mean. I was disappointed though...\n\nI lived opposite the wonderful, and sadly no longer existent, Marcella's in Tollcross for two years and would frequently pop by for a takeaway pasta dish which tasted wonderful and was only \u00a33. Last night I really wanted pasta, but was going to get back late from work with no time to cook. How I wished for a Marcella's in Leith! Then I remembered Eatalia's.  I'd never been but it was on my way home so thought I'd give it a go.\n\nThe plus points: Pretty good and varied menu, and the service was friendly. \n\nBad points..: I missed my bus because the food took longer to arrive than I'd been led to believe. The prices are too high (\u00a36.80 for takeaway lasagna?!). And the food itself was really nothing to write home about. The lasagna was disappointing - far too much mozarella on the top and far too little ragu. And way to heavy on the oregano. I love lasagna but I won't be ordering that again. The garlic bread was average.  \n\nI might be back, and if so I'll try another pasta (most of which are around the \u00a35.50 mark,  still expensive but not as bad), but only if I'm really craving pasta and have no time to cook from scratch."
0,Horrible. Not relaxing at all. I feel worse now than I did before. I also do not like how they treated my wife.
0,"i love coupons. apparently the server at cantina laredo doesn't. i presented mine (free guacamole!) and she looked horrified but returned a few minutes later with all the proper ingredients. it was fun to watch the guacamole mashed together right in front of our eyes. we dined with some out of town guests who found the guacamole presentation exciting ... i fear that until friday night they had never been introduced to it. \n\nour out-of-towners are not familiar with the mexican food the way most phoenicians are and asked *lots* of questions that were met with nothing short of annoyance from our server. then my dad demanded the server re-explain an entree for my mother, who \""might\"" want to order it (she didn't). yes, our table was probably a pretty annoying one to be stuck with, but that's part of being a server. suck it up. i'm sure you dealt with people far more awful than our group before.\n\nour food arrived within a reasonable length of time. the server and her helper had a hard time figuring out whose food belonged to whom - fine at applebee's, but i expected that this place would match the entree to the diner with ease. the food, admittedly, looked great. i had the fiesta chicken salad, complete with not ripe avocado and delivered with the wrong dressing. i ate it anyway. chicken was way too salty. hub had the carne asada steak. it was served charred but tasty, and portion was really small. we just didn't understand how that cheap cut of meat could fetch $18.99. i can't speak to what the other 5 in our group had; i was focused on choking down my salty chicken. \n\nafter our food was delivered, our server failed to appear again until she asked if we would like dessert. i could have used another vodka tonic 20 minutes earlier and a water refill. dessert, a chocolate nut brownie thing with ice cream, was created table side and everyone agreed it was the best part of the meal. my bottom line: the food we ate was overpriced. our food was just ok. service sucked. there's no reason to go back."
0,"I went thinking wow an Italian Restaurant, but was disappointed.  I went there for a business meeting, and part of the meeting was lunch, and despite that the food was fresh, and warm, it had quite a bit to be desired for me.  Both the Chicken Marsala & Pork where over cooked and somewhat tough & seasoning was reasonable.  The tortellini where over cooked, and just covered in a sauce that I could have just drank because it was so loose.  For me the highlight was Chocolate Mousse which was rich, but at the same time to dense.  Proper Chocolate mouse should be the consistency of pudding.  I could have turned the dish upside down and it would still have stayed.  On top of this the staff where in a hurry to get the restaurant reset, so much that it was extremely difficult to discuss any business because table, chairs where being thrown every where.  Not sure if was the manager or the waitstaff, but many of them just had an attitude of not wanting us there.  Perhaps this was not their day, and perhaps I would try the restaurant again if I was invited, however I would not go there and pay good money for this type of food and service when there are good Italian restaurant's in Charlotte."
1,Amazing club/bar!!! Live music every night! Great staff! I have been coming for years and it is always a good time!
0,BEWARE!!!!!\n\n   So this company not only did not deliver any products as promised but after they wrote me a email saying they would return the funds back to my card they contested it with my Credit Card.... Just goes to show what bad business and frauds they are at LAWLESS Hence the name!!! \n\n   BEWARE !!!!! ONCE they take your $$$$MONEY they won't deliver on time or as promised and then try to keep your money!!
0,"Great boba drinks! I've tried the Thai tea, mango, and watermelon. Very good (very sweet if you like that, I do). The boba is excellent. I lived in Hawaii for many years so I know my boba :)\n\nWhere they lose 3 stars for me...\n\nCustomer service is severely lacking (bad attitude from the lady taking our order at the counter) and the drinks are overpriced. Plus, it's too warm in there. Come on, it's 110 degrees outside...stop being cheap and turn on the AC! Also, you must spend a minimum of $10 in order to use a debit card. I HATE when businesses do this because I never carry cash. It's so annoying.\n\nNext time I'm getting the drinks to go."
0,Tjis place is out of the price range for most college kids and I feel the food is very average. Which would be fine if I wasn't paying extra for average food. I got taken here twice for a focus group for my major and since it was free I cant complain. But there's no way I would pay full price here.\n\nI'm a heavy eater. And by heavy eater I mean I normally throw down to or three normal entrees at regular restaurants.these portions do not fill the average person though. Its not a bad restaurant but its not great either.
0,"I don't know what happened, but this place is terrible now. It was previously one of the best sandwiches ever, but my steak & egg breakfast sandwich was oily and i couldn't even finish it. My wife didn't like either of the sandwiches she tried.\n\nI'm very disappointed, we couldn't wait to get back here, but now the food is bad. See below for my first review.\n\n------------------------------------\nBest sandwiches ever!! It was the little things that made the difference. I had a turkey/avocado sandwich, but it was warm... not too hot or cold. But the real joy was the balsamic onions, it was a pleasant surprise that made a common sandwich uncommonly good."
0,"As for the property its ok, but the biggest problem is the way members of the staff handle residents. Be prepared to be told one thing and then they do another. Watch out!"
0,I deposited a check in bank of america atm before 8pm last night. The check was a little over $2200. It was written from a bank of america business account. They put a hold on the check for 1 week even though it was drawn on a bank of america account. They already debited the account it was written off of. They will not let my boss cancel the check yet they will not give me the money til the 4th. So why are they holding my money for 1 week. I put a check in last week and it cleared the next day. This makes no sense. I have started a srew bank of america facebook group that is growing by leaps and bounds. Take my advice & the hundreds of others in the group and dont use this bank. The worse part about it was the smug attitude of the manager. Join the fb group & let these bastards know that our business is a privledge and not a right!
0,"After watching an advert for large burgers in 3d Phoenix was sunny with no sign of cheeseburger. Didn't  stop at the nearest place, Johnny Rockets ,and we went a bob bob bobbin' along to Red Robin. \nNear 4 in the afternoon isn't a busy time but the service-dividend one would hope to reap wasn't  present. \n\nGreetings, placement, balloon for kid all happy:) time to drinks good. Then not so much. \n\nOrdered a burger that had jalapenos as part of the garnish. What i got was double fried, at least, and cold .While the server did go back and get some  it's a pain in the ass to have to open up, pick them out, and wait for the new ones to get back. It's a small thing? Maybe so small that anyone with brains would not serve cold, fat sodden and about as far from crispy as you can get in the first place.Paltry number of fries ( seemingly you can ask for more but found that out a little too late\n\nThe bun was claimed to be a jalapeno,meant to be chipotle mayo  and the burger was meant to have seen cayenne. Tasted fine, just not gourmet  in terms of ingredients and presentation.\n\nMy wife's BLTA was the straggliest SINGLE piece of bacon we've seen in a long time and the 2 piece of avocado  seemed to have visited the same health farm as the pig:) \n\nSlow refills, had to ask for mine. Wife's refilled but way late in meal. \nPoor value. realistically it's about 2.25 rounded down."
1,"We enjoy visiting Holstein's at Cosmo when we are in town. Sure, you can eat at the hoity toity spots if you want. We enjoy sharing a burger and Caesar salad. Yea, don't be afraid to share. The burgers are plentiful. Service is friendly and efficient. The only complaint I would say are the low seated booths and awkwardly uncomfortable chairs."
1,Perfect size brown rice broccoli bowl was sooo good.    Chicken and steak better than fast food places...   Plus the Customer service is amazing.  They member your name and bring it to your table.    PLEASE TIP THEM!!!    I'll be back
0,"Visited Sunflower last night in search of Scharffen Berger chocolates.  Nay on SB chocs, but you may find organic (Green &amp; Black's, Love, Newman's Own, etc.) in the impulse buy sections.  I sampled a peanut milk chocolate cluster and an almond chocolate cluster at the bulk section and decided I'd get some peanut ones.  I already had a plastic bag open and was about to jot down the item number on a label twisty-tie when I spotted something moving at the corner of my eye... I lifted the peanut chocolate cluster bin lid to have a look, and there was a 1/2- inch maggot doing its dance on one of the bin's walls!!  I dropped the lid shut, stared at the bugger to see if I wasn't just seeing things, lifted the lid back up and pinched it off the bin's wall with the plastic bag in hand, and handed the bag to a clerk and told him where I found it.  The manager on duty was close by so I repeated everything that transpired to her.  She said she'd empty and sanitize the bin immediately.  I didn't hang around to see if she did anything.\n\nUgh!  I'm getting shivers up and down my spine typing this just now!!  \n\nBTW, I had a look into the freezer aisles a few weeks ago to have a look at the Berto gelato selections and they ALL have a horrible case of freezer burn.  Looks like a pretty low turnover rate...  I'll try to see if Sunflower still carries Laloo goatmilk ice cream, but, honestly, I can't see myself going there anytime soon after the maggot incident...\n---\nUpdate: Just recalled that Sunflower never sold Laloo... I found Laloo's goatmilk ice cream at Whole Foods and AJ's Fine Foods.  Sorry for misleading!"
1,"Was looking for place for my visiting parents and spouse to watch the Pack and Vikings play last season (08).  Had a blast for the Packers game even though they (barely) lost.  We sat at the bar and played the machines while watching the game.  Had the halftime burger special and lots of beer.  Just a great, great time and memorable.  My dad loved it: cocktails, the Packers, and gambling all at once!  Woo hoo!  Will definitely go back."
0,Same experience as other Yelpers. Order is usually WRONG in one way or the other. Won't return here!
0,"Booked this hotel through a third party so was surprised by the sneak attack resort fee at check in.\nBe aware. It doesn't matter what you paid or how you paid it. They will up charge you.\nStaff was very nice and although they are stationed at every corner trying to sell you things they politely take no thank you for an answer.\nOur room was nice. Clean and comfortable. Bathroom was outdated and had to call maintenance to replace a light.\nUnfortunately they couldn't fix the shower faucet that required hard core ninja kicks to turn it on and off.\nIf you choose to forgo housekeeping and \""go green\"" they slip an $8 voucher under your door. That will AMOST buy you a cup of overpriced coffee.\nSmall fridge in the room but that's it. ( no coffee.....sigh)\nIf you do not enjoy dj hosted club music you won't be able to enjoy the pool in the evenings. I don't think it'd even be so bad if it were at least a more \""general audience\"" selection.\nNot alot of dining options in the hotel that are open evening hours. Weird for Vegas.\nOff the strip and lots of parking in the garage. I guess it could've been worse."
1,"One of my favorite sushi experiences everrrr.  I've been here three times on three different Vegas visits and it's always delicious.\n\nOn the last visit, we opted for a tasting menu for a party of 7.  The waiter was selling it pretty hard and we finally gave in.  Pretty glad we did too.  We asked for a lower end menu costing $50-55/head and the kitchen did a superb job.  We were able to taste way more than we would have ever imagined if we were to order a la carte.\n\nEdamame\nRock Shrimp Tempura - (MUST GET)\nYellowtail Seviche Taquitos - (YUM!)\nYellowtail w/ jalapeno and lemongrass taradito (this is the best one)\nKanpachi w/ yuzu sea salt and black truffle oil taradito \nTuna w/ granny smith serrano and lime taradito\nSalmon w/ orange and miso taradito\nFilet Mignon Robato w/ 4 kinds of sauteed mushrooms (YUUUM)\nChilean Sea Bass w/ Miso Sauce anticucho w/ Peruvian Corn (GIANT CORN-delicious fish)\nNeo Tokyo roll\nGreen Envy roll\nEl Topo roll\nPacific roll\nRainbow Dragon roll\n\nDrinks  - overall they have pretty good drinks, and if you are clever enough to score some 2 for 1 coupons, it's worth it!  I like the Samba Juice and the Lemon Samurai. :)"
1,"I work across the street from this gas station, and my \""gas station buddies\"" as I like to call them, and myself, go to this gas station every single day.  The people that work here know us well, and we joke and laugh together.  They are super helpful.  Whenever our favorite soda is out, there are more than willing to run to the back and change it.  There is also a wide selection of snacks and other drinks in the refrigerated section.  They keep the store clean, and clutter free.\n\nAll in all, if you are looking for a quick place to pick up snacks for the movies, or a quick drink for work, run over to this location.  They are always willing to help!"
0,"First of all, I have to point out that I am highly concerned that there are four \""hidden\"" reviews for this place, all of which are negative but not \""reccommended\"". Funny, how all the visible reviews are good, so it gives them a higher rating...? I wonder if my two-star review will become \""hidden\"" as well...? None of those reviews are inappropriate - they're honest. I think someone may be flagging them to hide them, which is not cool folks.\n\nOkay, so here's what I have to say. This place has amazing equipment and technology. Three years ago, I came here and was astounded - another eye doctor had tried telling me my eyes hadn't changed, but yet everything was fuzzy, I KNEW my eyes had changed. I came here to Sharper Vision and yes, they had proper equipment and with my new glasses, I could see again!! It was wonderful. I even recommended this place to my mother and grandmother. The eyeglasses selection is... on the minimal side, but I liked what they had, so I didn't mind. \n\nLately, though, the service has taken a turn, and not for the better. My last visit, I tried talking to the doctor about my eye muscles fluttering constantly in one eye, and he dismissed it. New glasses helped, but I still have this issue. I was also frustrated because their eyeglass selection has just gotten ridiculous. Hey, you want uber-trendy frames? This is the place to go. Fendi, Vogue, Juicy, oh, they got it. You'll pay upward of $500 for the frames alone, but they got it. You want reasonably priced simple frames? Eh... you might not be happy with what they have. Frankly, I didn't like the shape of the glasses I got, but they were all I could afford. Everything else was high-end brand names and too pricey. Unless, that is, I wanted huge granny-glasses or aviator styles that look straight out of the eighties. Yeah, they have those, too. Seriously, I think they stock those so that the beautiful $550 Fendi frames that compliment your eyes will suddenly look worth the cost.\n\nNow, I've been trying to get in to see the doctor again. My eye muscles are fluttering horribly, interrupting my sleep and my work, AND I'm planning a major vacation in about three weeks. I've been trying to get in to see someone for a month now, and they're always full.\n\nBut its not just that. When I call in, the office staff is horrible (hence why I'm pointing out those \""hidden\"" reviews, as they all mention the rudeness of the staff) and absolutely unhelpful. I call in and rather than trying to help me find an open appointment, I'm told every day they're filled up. Seriously? Every single slot filled for the next two weeks?? Not one opening??? What, is this eye-season or something?\n\nSo... I don't know what's going on. I don't know why they're hiding all the negative reviews here, I don't know why the staff is suddenly not being very helpful, and I don't know why it now costs nearly double to get glasses than it did my first time in. I still have respect for this place and their doctors... but I don't have the time to wait for them now, and I can't afford them. It makes me sad."
0,"Okay, so this is the second year I've gone to Foodie Fest.  Last year we went on a Friday night, this year on Saturday at 6:30.  The line to get it wasn't bad when we arrived, but our friends came 15 min. later and the line was down the street and around the corner. I'll mention the entrance fee in a min.\n\nThe variety of food trucks appeared extensive, however by 6:30 over half were closing up shop and White Castle - oh White Castle...this is the main reason the huz and I decided to go.  A sign greeted us at the entrance that stated they would no longer be serving.  We went in anyway, saw that they were still cooking and people were sitting around - we soon realized that was the 4 HOUR wait - they gave people chairs!  We decided to grab a beer, however almost all was gone, our choices were Miller Light, wine or water!  It seemed so pointless, so I called my friends who were still standing in line and told them not to waste money getting in and we met up for dinner elsewhere.  \n\nWhat's appalling to me is the fact that when we left around 7:00, the line was unbelievable and any food trucks still serving had lines and wait times I had no patience for.  I wanted to have a megaphone and let the people waiting in line know that it was a waste, but I refrained.  I can't believe they continued to accept people's money ($10 at that - $8 for military) without letting them know what to expect.  All I kept saying is that I felt ripped off $28 down the drain in 30 min. or less and we were still hungry!  \n\nThe event, in my opinion, was poorly run, poorly organized and the staff seemed a bit clueless (texting, calling & not paying attention).  I feel sorry for the folks who continued to wait in line. I doubt we will return to this event, I'd rather continue our trips down to First Friday (Downtown) and Vegas StrEATs (at El Cortez). MUCH better and most of the trucks are at these locations anyway.  \n\nBoo."

1,The food was delicious and tasted very fresh considering it was after lunch time
1,"As mentioned below, not the greatest atmosphere, but when it really comes down to it, I don't give a damn. I'd rather be eating a magnificent hot-link sandwich in a dusty, dimly lit place than a stale sad-looking sandwich at the bright and shiny Subway two blocks down. Prices are great, they have a wide variety of choices and of everything I've had so far has been immense. The guy who run's the place is wonderful-- we were there and the power went out from the storm and he just kept on making our food like there was nothing to it. \nIt is dingy looking and you might think twice before going in, but do. It's good. Oh! And they have catering, in case you have need of this in your life."
1,This is a Yelp favorite so I purchased the Groupon for a facial and it was worth every cent.  I made my 60 min facial appointment and my aesthetician Melanie was fabulous.  Not only was it the whole 60 minutes...not 50 minutes all 60 which was I was really surprised.  It was very relaxing and she talked about each treatment along with scalp and hand massages.  I really enjoyed the whole experience everyone there was very friendly.  I plan to get more facials here with Melanie.
1,"i can't believe i haven't written a review of this yet, considering i've been here a thousand times. this was however the first time i've gone and there hasn't been some sort of event going on. it's actually quite peaceful!\n\nwe went to rent SUP for an hour. the park is just great i think. there's a water play area for kids and it's located right off the fun strip of Mill. tempe beach park hosts numerous festivals and events throughout the year. \n\nfun, fun, fun."
1,You have to try the Steak Tataki. It is absolutely amazing!!
1,Another decent Pho place in the greater Phoenix area. This one is very clean and nicely decorated.  Staff is very friendly.  Pho and spring rolls are delicious. Price is a little more expensive compared to other pho places. But you do get a lot of food here.
1,"We stopped by Little Italy on our way home from Laughlin, NV and I have to say this place was amazing.  We had the gourmet pizza, and aside from it being huge, the topping were fresh, the crust was awesome and the service was great.  If your travels ever take you to Gila Bend definitely stop by Little Italy."
1,"If you are looking for apartments in Ahwatukee, I would definitely recommend Liv Ahwatukee.  The staff is so nice and helpful.  I would give them a call to be put on the list for when they open this summer!"
0,Place is always out of cotton candy ice cream! It's always a crying kid! It's the number one flavor they get 15 5 gallon containers every Thursday and by Monday are sold out! Get more if you sell that much! Place has no biz can't afford to give up sales
1,"Really good lunch spot for takeout (the restaurant is divided into takeout and dine-in, and the dine-in portion is relatively small for large groups). I'm a big fan of the classic mozzarella sandwich and vanilla bean rice pudding. They don't have much on their menu online, but the few items they do have, they do really well. If you order takeout, make sure to call in 15 minutes before your pick up time so that they'll have it ready. Otherwise, you'll be waiting for your takeout. \n\nIf you're going for a market sandwich, I recommend calling in to get their special. It can be a hit or miss. I got a market sandwich without calling once and ended up with a turkey sloppy Joe. It had a great taste but extremely messy and oily to eat."
1,"Delicious-- try the spicy basil noodles.  Really relaxed atmosphere, nice low lighting, friendly staff.  Your water glass will never get more than a third empty!  \n\nOh, sometimes I really miss Pittsburgh."
1,"Great local Tempe bar and venue! The Yucca is a few steps above a dive, with a great beer and liquor selection, and fair prices. Great place to start or end your night, or to catch a gig. Also, lots of craft beers on tap in the east room, great place to try new brews if you don't want to spend an arm and a leg at World of Beers on Mill."
1,"I really enjoyed this place! We got in early on a Thursday (first stop of the night since arriving) and tried to pay for drinks when the bartender informed us that all well drinks were free for the first hour! That was pretty fortunate for us, but not fortunate for the one guy in our group who ordered a non-well drink (and paid tons for it). The vibe was very chill, there were places to sit, and the music was great. Don't ignore this gem just because it's off the Strip! Pay for the cheap cab ride, get there early, and take advantage of their well drink special. You'd be stupid not to!"
1,"I came here with my brother because I had a coupon that was about to expire. The place is pretty small, but there are lots of places to sit. My brother ordered a pork combo burrito ($5.75) and a pint of beer ($1). I ordered a chicken ensalada ($6.95). The burrito came wrapped in foil. It was so huge it looked like it was going to explode in my brother's face. He took his first bite and said, \""*%#! yeah, this is dank!\"" Translated into normal English, that means it was delicious. He was also very pleased about being able to get a pint of beer for a buck. That's a pretty sweet deal and I think it's all day everyday. My ensalada wasn't what I expected. I was expecting it to be a salad in a tostada BOWL, but it was actually a big salad on top of a flat tostada in a foil bowl. All the juices of the huge salad made the little tostada all soggy on the bottom, so I didn't eat it. The salad itself was good though, I was just expecting to get it in a crunchy tostada bowl that I could tear apart and turn into chips. Even though I wasn't too fond of my salad, I am still a fan of this place. My brother loved his burrito, they have lots of specials, and the prices are cheap!\n\nTips:\n*Monday night sliders - $1 Santa Fe sliders 4-9pm\n*Taco Tues - $1 beef tacos 4-9pm\n*Wed - 1/2 price breakfast burritos til 11am. $6 Roadrunner pizza 4-9pm\n*Thurs - $6.50 bottomless bowl of green chile stew 4-9pm\n*Fajita Friday - %6 chicken, $7 steak, $8 shrimp fajitas 4-9pm\n*Sat rib night - $8.95 Red Chile Pork Ribs Adovada w/ green chile cheddar mashed potatoes and Calabacitas\nSunday - 2 for 1 breakfast burritos all day long\n*Carlito's Special Lager $1"
1,"Beautiful decor. \nOne of my favorite salads. Avacadoe on the bottom, stocked with Greens, with a crunchy top. For an Entree i love the Lasagna and the Osu Buco (forgive my spelling). \nService is great. \nI Definately recommend."
1,"Super good italian food. Food, service and atmosphere was wonderful. This is not a super casual, family pizza place. We went for dinner and it was a little nicer than I thought it would be. The food is so good! We ordered the anti pasto platter and it was yummy! The pizza, drinks, and service was first rate! \n\nThe food had wonderful flavor and fresh ingredients. Y-U-M! \n\nI got the Red Blend wine and it was really smooth and went well with my food. \nWe are definitely coming back!!"
1,"In addition to the name, which I love by the way, I really liked this place.  I went here with some coworkers after work for a couple of beers.  There were five of us, we each got an appetizer and each had two or more beers apiece and our tab was $50.  Not too bad for a couple hours of drinking on the patio.  They have a pretty decent selection of food and we all seemed to enjoy our fare (nothing special, just your typical bar food), and they offer mini pitchers of beer (I love that).\n\nMy only complaint is that they allow smoking on their patio.  It's just gross.  But, the patio is big enough that we just moved \""upwind\"" from the smokers and we were fine.  \n\nThis would be a great spot to go watch a couple of games on the patio in the gorgeous weather and have a few drinks.  I'll be back again."
1,"Cafe Rio has to have the best chicken burritos there! Everything is so fresh and full of flavor! I get me burrito enchilada style and I definitely recommend that. Everything is fresh and made by hand, like their flour and corn tortillas. Definitely one of my fave places!..:)"
0,"I'm not really sure how to feel about The Dogs. Myself and my colleagues visited here just prior to Christmas for a little lunch. We had three courses and although I can't fault the absolutely delicious main I had of a beef burger with red onion jam and bacon (which was STUNNING), my dessert left quite a lot to be desired. \n\nI ordered something which doesn't seem to be on the menu any more, but was a winter berry and toffee mess with marscapone. It was a pretty \""ok\"" dessert, but what really brought it down was discovering that part of the packaging for the marscapone had made its way into my dessert.\n\nThe owner David was serving us and I let him know about this. He took it back to the kitchen without saying much of anything about it and I was left to sit a bit confused about whether I was getting a fresh dessert or we'd just be comped for that one. I had been a bit put off by that point so didn't really want a fresh dessert. He eventually reappeared with a new dish and I felt a bit of a tit having to refuse it. To his credit he did explain that the packing was perfectly harmless, but no one ever likes to find something they weren't expecting in their food.\n\nWe were sat in the back room of the Dogs and although there was an obvious theme running through (dogs, unsurprisingly!) and the mismatched chairs and pews were a nice touch, the decor has seen better days. Some might call it decor with character, but I felt it crossed the line a little into tired.\n\nSpeaking of character, the owner David's a bit of a character in himself and he may not be everyone's cup of tea as he's pretty plain spoken and can come across as stand-offish if he's serving you, but he's also one of The Dogs charms if you like a bit of banter and an honest, forthright business owner.\n\nI probably wouldn't recommend The Dogs in a hurry, but may give them a second chance myself at some point."
0,So slow!! The staff was really slow and more busy talking about what they were gonna do over the weekend then hurry and bring patients back... I hear they have appointments... I will do that next time and see how long it takes....
1,"Love this place! I've been going here since they were tiny with just a handful of tables, before they expanded. A great mom n' pop place that offers both great service and food! Try the buffalo chicken pizza, delicious!!!"
1,"I am in love with this restaurant, if only they hired better staff to handle the front of the house it would become a regular spot for me. The service is so slow but the restaurant is amazing. From my experience so far you really can't go wrong with whatever you choose to order from their menu. Great atmosphere and great food, hopefully the service speeds up and then its a perfect night out."
1,"Love this place! Great service, great drinks and great location. My husband and I can't stand Starbucks due to their horrible fake coffee drinks. Coffee bean makes their espresso drinks the old fashion way and you can actually taste the caffeine! Plus they know our drink order and we only come on the weekends. We love it!"
0,"Never again !\n\nThe fish here is as cheap as you can get, pre-fabricated fish squares that are slightly better than McDonald's filet-o-fish. The shrimp that I ordered were flat, like pounded out flat, who knows what this crap was. The fries  were limp and flavorless. The only thing that made this any better was the \""special sauce\"", which I believe to be hot sauce & ketchup.\n\nThis place is SUPER cheap and the food reflects why. There is no reason I will ever eat here again, peace out Pete's !"
1,"Had the big breakfast (wanted to try haggis and black pudding for the first time) at a reasonable price.  Nice little spot with a few tables and window-front seating.  Breakfast made in front of you, if you want to watch."
1,"A handful of restaurants? Check.\nA smattering of retail? Check.\nATMs up the wazoo? Check. \nTheaters to catch some sweet shows? Check. \nSome tables to people watch, and hang for a bit? Check. \nPotential for a huge event space? Check.\n\nYes, folks, this IS Founders Hall. More than an atrium in the Bank of America building, this expansive space also serves as the vessel for the above and a bangin' event space. I attended Art With Heart, which was hosted here, and it was quite lovely. Tons of shiny floors, open, expansive spaces and plenty of room to move around. Plus, there are multiple access points to enter Founders Hall (Hearst Tower, College St., Tryon St.). \n\nYou'll find retail from the major chains (Jos. A Bank) to the local options (Julie's, Ivy & Leo) as well as plenty of tasty options to grab a bite. If you're walking around Uptown, definitely take a gander through Founders Hall - if nothing more than to grab a seat and watch the bankers make their bank!"
1,"I happen to live near this place and I only tried it for the first time 1 month ago. There is a wait time about 20-30 minutes usually. Cute decor feels retro. They offer free \""hot chocolate\"" type shots to start which is nice. I ordered their yogurt and my husband has the grilled cheese with duck. I love my plate as well as their coffee. The grilled cheese lacked some cheese and only had duck in the middle and a small portion. Id go back to try different things. The staff is friendly. Still a decent breakfast place compared to a lot"
1,"This cafe is AMAZING!! The first time I went there, I ordered the \""sweet treat mocha,\"" which was one of their seasonal drinks (chocolate, hazelnut, caramel latte). Sooo good. I mean seriously delicious. My boyfriend ordered a vanilla latte, which was pretty strong, and he loved it. The next day, I went back and ordered an iced \""nutcracker\"" (chocolate, hazelnut, and vanilla latte). Again, ridiculously good.\n\nIn addition to the wonderful drinks, this place has a great atmosphere. There are tables outside and on the first and second floors. There are plenty of seating options from small to large tables and comfy arm chairs, too. There are also cases of books, a table with games, and a tv on the second floor.\n\nLastly, the service is friendly, and they bring your order to the table. The prices are pretty high, especially on their pastries. The drinks are worth every cent thought. All in all, this place is one of the best coffee cafes I have ever been to."
1,"We finally got a chance to try this place Friday and loved it. The ambiance and design of the place is wonderful. The staff is super friendly and most are very good looking. We ordered a bunch of different appetizers including their nachos, quesadillas, fried calamari, and queso dip. Everything was good, not stellar, but tasted pretty good. The fried calamari wasn't crispy enough for my liking. I left full and happy though, which is all that really matters. We also ordered their sangria, because everyone had talked about it. They have four different flavors. Their passion fruit one is by far the best, a couple of those and you will have a great buzz going on. In general I really enjoyed my experience here, and will definitely be going back for their delicious sangria!"
1,Breakfast sandwich was terrific with a mimosa which I believe had muddled raspberry? Capuccino has cinnamon sprinkled on top which I don't really care for but otherwise it was good. I love supporting local businesses and this is worthy of support.
1,"when i close my eyes and imagine the perfect spa experience i find myself walking around a beautiful, calm space, full of the sounds of running water, decorated with slate, dark wood and and glass. everything seems fresh and clean.  there is a soft robe waiting for me, a locker room with rows and rows of showers, a waiting area with plush couches and a counter of healthy snacks and drinks (plus coffee in case i missed getting some along the way here).  the staff is friendly and subdued.  helpful, but not overly \""loud\"" to disrupt the peace that's settling over me. \n\ni love my body scrub, i adore my bath. i'm completely relaxed by my hot-stone massage, and the facial tops it off perfectly.  i continue to be impressed by how flawlessly everything flows into the next.  everyone i come in contact with is helpful, professional, and seems as content to be in the space as i am.\n\nin between the series of treatments i receive, i'm escorted back to the waiting area and am allowed to indulge in jacuzzis, steam rooms, hot and cold pools, but i mostly choose to lounge and sip tea. i would and could linger in this space all day, but the only way to share it with others is to leave and tell them about it.\n\nwhen i close my eyes, nobody rushes me. nobody asks anything of me but to enjoy these perfect treatments and this perfect atmosphere. i am pampered, indulged, completely relaxed and blissful.\n\nwhen i open my eyes, i'm at THEbathhouse at mandalay bay."
0,I went to this chick fil A a couple weeks ago and it was breakfast time. But I asked if I could order lunch and they said yes. service was great as usual but when I got the sandwich and return to work the chicken on the sandwich was half the size of the normal chicken. I know this cuz I eat there multiple times a week.
0,"The Olde Towne location is flawlessly managed.  Even when busy, the staff seems to be completely on their game so much a customer is still made to feel special.  WHAT is wrong with the Scottsdale Quarter space?  It certainly has the usual Sam Fox stunning style.  The food, ONCE IT ARRIVES (!), is great too.  Why is the North Scottsdale space so lacking in good service?  I have been here three times.  Twice it wasn't busy, and I was made to feel as if my server was doing me a favor by condescending to wait on me without smiling.  The third time was at a peak weekend rush, and not only did the three different waitresses I had seem utterly confused, one actually got angry at me when I quietly asked why my appetizers hadn't  arrived after half an hour.  True Food Kitchen is also a Fox Concepts restaurant in the same shopping center, and it's perfect.  Please, Mr. Fox, fix this mess soon!"
0,"The food is good, and they have most everything one could want, but the price is a show-stopper.  For a lot less that $20, I can find everything available here, except the prime rib, for a lot less elsewhere.  There was the potential for a wide variety of sushi, except the platters were always empty.  There was gelato, but only three flavors since they were out of chocolate and mint chocolate chip.  \n\nWith better prices and lots of coupon deals at Oriental Buffet, and a better selection for a few dollars more at Wandering Horse Buffet, this place seems to be caught in the never land middle ground."
1,"After having mock meat meals at a number of restaurants across the world, this place ranks up there. A group of 4 can eat every item from the buffet menu. \nGo hungry, drink lots of water. The sodium content does catch up with you. \nClosed off the meal with some red bean ice cream. \nWill be back here next time to finish the rest of the menu."
1,"Great service from the owner himself, really good gyro wrap and beautiful finish with kunafeh."
0,Downtown Phoenix newest place to see dude on dude action. Service was horrible tonight we had 4 waiters come up to our table each taking our drink order. One of the waiters gave us a fuck off look when we asked for a menus.  15 mins later when one of our waiters brought our drinks my beer was luke warm.

0,"For a great cause but will not be returning...\n\nI was so excited to go to the Magical Forest for a great holiday experience but was greatly disappointed.  \n\nToo many people crammed into one space, lack of organization, and a forced Christmas spirit with glorified advertisements as decorations (who wants a picture with that?).\n\nThe 'magical forest' walk through was way too crowded, they need to take control of the crowd to handle the volume of people. They should only let a certain number of people in 'the forest' at a time with timed space between each group, as it  would avoid the congestion and claustrophobia.  I realize people want to take pictures and let their kids wander, but it's very hard to do when you have 50 people behind you breathing down your neck,  it felt like cattle herding.  \n\nI will be looking somewhere else for my Christmas cheer, as I do not need to experience the feeling of a 'Black Friday crowd' twice in one season, and certainly do not want to be leaving as a Grinch."
1,I just want to hug that sweet little old man who runs the front.  SO NICE.\n\nThe orange chicken is delicious.  We're also a big fan of the teriyaki... portion sizes are pretty big but leftovers never stick around in the fridge for long.  The sauce is great though.\n\nThe decor is plain but I think they're trying to update it a bit... the location is a little sketchy.  But the food definitely makes up for it.\n\nDefinitely a Chandler must.
0,"I bought the groupon for a haircut with Moroccanoil and full highlights . I asked for natural-looking, sunkissed highlights and I was given a platinum bleached look instead. The \""full highlights\"" did not include the entire bottom half of my head... Is that standard?! If I wanted only part of my hair colored, I would have purchased the partial highlights option. I don't think any Morrocanoil products were used and I didn't get the conditioning treatment which should have been included. After all the $$, hours and effort - I would have preferred to do it myself and get what I asked for.\n\nThat being said, the place itself is nice and you could probably have a better experience if you request a specific stylist.. My stylist seemed nice but she did not communicate very well and I think the problems I had with Hotbox could have been lessened if she had talked me through the process."
1,"PDSF Review:  PARKING is free; casino parking lot.  DECOR: restaurant is really small; 50% of the seating at the bar; 50% in high chair/tables.  Line may be get long; so avoid dining rush hours. SERVICE was solid.  FOOD: Corn chowder was salty.  However, when it comes to the seafood pan roast - it was unforgettable.  Every bite had seafood and the seasoning was perfect.  The only caution is the spiciness.  I usually eat very, very spicy, so I thought a Level 9 would be ok... but that pan roast made me sweat and tear up in the eyes... it was too spicy.   I think if I were to go back next time, I would stick to level 7, so that I can actually taste and enjoy the food.  The best pan roast chef if \""Tip\"", a very nice Asian lady."
0,DO NOT RENT FROM E Z CAR RENTAL\n\nE Z Car rental is a JOKE! Don't rent from them... You can find a rental agency that's a few bucks more and better service. They treat locals like criminals. Cheaper is not always better. Stay away. Corporate doesn't return phone calls. They don't care about customers or service. I only can imagine what bullshit I would or could have went through if I got a car through them. I lost over $100 when I had a quote through a different company but canceled it because I was saving $20.
0,"Place is alright. I was in a hurry and needed gas, but if you get Chevron, you're better off going to the one on Kyrene or Rural on Baseline. A lot cheaper compared to this one."
0,Stopped in this morning to get breakfast for my team and got a huge serving of bad attitude from the staff.  This is the first and last time I'll set foot in this place. I'll go up the street to Einstein's where I can get food without the 'tude.
0,"Disappointing. \nService (just the server) was middle of the road to poor. Expected a lot more from a Thomas Keller place. \nOysters were good. Server forgot oyster forks and a bowl. Brought them after we asked. \nPate was off the charts good. \nFoie gras was bland. Some of the worst I've ever had. Wtf? Tasteless and like refrigerated lard. Lacked the wonderful textures and nuanced flavor that good foie gras has. Sigh.\n\nMy friend's fish was on the bland side. Or uninspired. Lacking something. My pork short ribs were really tasty, but both of our entrees were on the just barely warm side. More Wtf. \nDessert order was taken. Server returned to explain they were out of the one my friend ordered. Ok. I know it happens. Just added to the sense that the server wasn't paying attention. Dessert was dropped and table hadn't been marked (no silverware).  Another server noticed and brought us silverware.\n\nThe back server (or busboy if you must call him that, though you ought not to) however: Amazing. This guy was on top of everything he could be expected to be from start to finish. HE was what we expected from the place. Changed plates, checked on us (when the server was off schmoozing the table of hot ladies next to us (yeah, I get it, they're hot and we're just a couple of guys, but we're ordering well and aren't you just the least bit aware of the difference in service you're providing our two tables when we're right next to each other and we can SEE it??).... oh wait, I was talking about how great the back server was... Right. He was great. Crumbed. Refilled. Fast. Expedient. Made us feel at the least... cared about? Noticed? Something like that.\n\nLower than average overall experience.\n\nPalmed the back server cash on the way out. 20% to the server because you do. And sadly, wouldn't  go back."
1,Really an open air English pub with basic bar and bench style seating. Great curb appeal too. Staff was friendly and helpful. The beer selection is strong with almost no domestic beers. The food is a homemade hot pocket but fantastic. Lots of selection for ingredients and the pastry is thin and light. Very hearty and good for lunch.
0,"I used to go here regularly, but stopped... the kid who works at the front desk is a pain. He says there are appointments available, then says there aren't. I went in for my appointment, waited 30 minutes and then when I asked him what was going on he had an attitude, I don't mind waiting when I'm a walk in, but not when I've made an appt days before. The girls do a good job... if you can get in and they're not busy because they're great, they're busy because they only have two girls working the whole place."
0,You don't go here for the food. I have eaten here at least 10 times but it will never be anything better than just eatable. It is however full of interesting objects both stationary and automatonic individuals with upgraded body parts.
0,I agree with Danielle. I have been going there for years without a problem and I recently went there expecting the same service... The place has changed. I dropped a uniform off that I needed to pick up the same day so I made sure I was there before 9am... when I went back to pick up and they told me since it is being laundered it won't be ready until tomorrow. I showed my tickets that said current date by 4pm... she then told me it's wrong how they don't do it like that anymore and how it would be too much work for them to find it for us... but offered up half of the uniform... I guess they don't understand the reason for a uniform. How do you argue with someone with that kind of mentality?
1,"One of my favorite breakfast places in town!!! It's really chill and the ambiance feels like I've been transported to New York. Get anything with lox here, matzoh ball soup, and you have GOT to make sure you check out their pastry selection. They are to die for. Boston cremes as big as my head! Everything here tastes fresh! So explore ahead without fear~ *Note: DON'T FORGET THE DELI.\n\nMy only gripe with this place is every single time I've been here the service is terrible. Been left here waiting for 15-20 min at my table to get my order out...and it's not even busy. And splitting checks is always hard---SO BRING CASH. Regardless, I love the place still...just not enough for a 5 star..4.5 starts please?!"
0,"Id have to say my experience here was truly awful. Did the crepe itself taste great? Yes. I ordered a nutella crepe for take out and after at least 35 minutes of waiting i finally got it. When i took my crepe out of the bag it was literally wrapped in a ball of tin foil. It was a crepe ball. On top of that they had NO plastic utensils even when asked. They are not at all prepared for take out. The food is great tasting but not something i would recommend for take out. Id say its a great place if you dont mind sitting in an extremely small and loud resteraunt, waiting half an hour for food. But yes, the crepes do taste quite good."
0,"This was one of the worst venues i've ever been to.  The music was great! but the service was awful!!  on top of charging you 11 dollars for a domestic beer, as soon as the last band plays the \""security guards\"" (who think they are super important) treat everyone like cattle and start forcing you out the door.  No time to rest, finish your 11 dollar beer, or go to the bathroom, you have to leave now!!  unless of course you pay extra, on top of the amount you spend to get in in the first place..  I'd go to Amos, Tremont, or The MIlestone for a real music experience..  This place sucks!"
0,This place is only after money! Their photo facial is ineffective even after 3 sessions that they recommended! their hair laser treatments burns the skins and makes blister!  they don'T know what they are doing in any means aND NOT CONSISTENT IN THEIR WORDS!! they have no sympathy!\nstay away from this place! Not a trustworthy place at all!
1,"Meat & Potatoes was a blast. Arrived w/o a reservation on a Saturday night and even though we were told we would not get a table for another 1.5-2 hours we could find seats at the bar. We found one for the two of us (of course) but decided to stake our territory anyway with the one chair and to grab another when one freed up, which took some waiting and work including dealing with a rude old man...\n\nAside from that I love the dark interior of M & P with the mirrors and gold trim surrounding the room. It adds a nice element of elegant coziness. \n\nThe bartenders greeted us and were kind enough to give us a sample of the beers we were interested in trying. Ordered the Oscar and my bf ordered the Kobe Flat Iron. Oscar had a cut of veal, a fried soft shell crab on top and a side of risotto. Delicious - kind of on the salty side but I like it that way. I ate every bite but I had a hard time cutting with the knives they gave me (first butter knife then was given a steak knife when realized I was cutting with a butter knife). And the service continued to be great - the bartenders checked in periodically, were friendly and didn't push you out of  M & P. They let you soak in the experience and we did."
1,"Consistently good food. Stay away from the ravioli as unlike Carrabba's other pastas, it is frozen and not made fresh. The Sicilian Chicken soup is amazing as are the grilled chicken dishes. There is so much good about this place, I could go on a while. The desserts in the shot glasses that taste like they've been sitting for a week and the bland iced tea are my only complaints.\n\nThe Chicken Rosa Maria (?) is amazing! Hit and miss for how good it is. Varies from good to great depending on the chef."
1,"Jeff, the bartender at Sage that helped us, is a pretty awesome mixologist. He isn't afraid to just hear an ingredient and make up a delicious concoction for you to try. He knows his ins and outs of liquor flavors, mixers, fruits, and all that jazz. When Misti Y and I stopped by she was able to sample a most refreshing mixture that contained canton, fresh muddled raspberries, and ginger beer among other ingredients. \n\nI myself had the Tea Rose cocktail. This is made with tea vodka, rose water, St. Germain, and is garnished with roasted pine nuts. It's as interesting as it sounds and while I don't think the flavor is for everyone I also don't think it was so offensive or strong that you couldn't drink it if you had to.\n\nMisti and I also shared a tuna crudo and cheese plate for snacks, both of which I really enjoyed. The cheese plate had 4 varieties on it I believe and it wasn't an overwhelmingly large selection so if you're sharing between more than 2 people you may want more than one plate. Overall though I can see why Sage is such a hit for yelpers. I'd love to come back and try proper dinner and more cocktails the next time I'm in town."
0,I've been here since my teeny bopper years and it's been like a roller coaster! I remember it use to be much different from now. For some reason the food is just not as good as it use to be. The chefs appear to be the same or at least one of them is so I can't quite pin point as to why. The flavors just isn't there. For example I always order the jalape\u00f1o fried rice and it gets worse everytime I order it. Por que?!! I love this joint and it's twist on Japanese cuisine but it can definitely improve on it's quality and consistency. Service has been and still is decent. Maybe we need to bring back #TBT.
0,Can I give it no stars? This place was FILTHY! It looks good when you first walk in but when you sit for 2 hours you start to notice things such as everyone coming out of the bathroom going straight to the hand sanitizer. It wasn't until my husband used it that we found out the soap dispenser was broken & there were no paper towels. The seats have silver arm rests but were covered in smears. When I was called I asked to use restroom & it appeared clean but when you sat down on toilet you were looking at a cabinet/table which holds the urine sample cups. There was what appeared to be urine spilled down the front of it. Gross!\nNext back to room & when I went to close the door I noticed a large semi circle area of dirt built up around the door handle. I got a paper towel & put a large amount of hand sanitizer on towel & cleaned it. I was not going to touch that handle area without cleaning it. I also noticed the chairs in the room were dirty also. This is the kind of dirt that builds up over time. \nThe medical treatment was OK but I had a sample given & the doctor tried to tell me what was wrong with me without ever running the sample. I also asked for exact detailed results including lab results so I could provide this information to my doctor but I didn't get it even when I asked again. I waited in the room after the doctor saw me for another 30 minutes just for paperwork.  \nI will not use this location again when I'm in Vegas & I'm going to contact my insurance company regarding them also. How can you call yourself a medical care center when you are treating sick people but not cleaning on a regular bases.
0,"La bi\u00e8re est tr\u00e8s d\u00e9cevante pour le prix (ex: 13$ pour une grosse bi\u00e8re a 7% qui goutais l'eau et qui donnais mal au coeur).

1,"I booked two nights through LivingSocial for only $56 (no resort fees) for Easter weekend and also spring break week for most college students. most hotels started out in the $100s (some with resort fees) for the days I wanted to book.\n\nThe hotel wasn't bad at all like what other people have reviewed here. Maybe I got lucky?\n\nOur room was located in Central Tower and my only complaint would be that we chose the room next to the elevator since it was the only non-smoking and King size bed they had. You can hear the elevator from your room going up and down, though it wasn't loud enough to keep me awake at night.\n\nThe rooms actually looked like the pictures we saw online and it was clean and nicely arranged.\n\nThe hotel is conveniently connected to the monorail, so despite this hotel not being near the center of the strip, the monorail took care of that.\n\nIf I were to visit Vegas again I would definitely stay at LVH if there was another good deal like the one I got from LivingSocial."
0,"Pro: Sugary Krispy Kreme, friendly staff. \n\nCon: Not fresh enough. \n\nCame here after the first day of CES for sugary goodness before dinner time, was a bit disappointed by the fact that this location was only a drop off location, but the service was fast especially have we would tired as hell. \n\nWould come back again if around this side of the strip, but still, not beats fresh Krispy Kreme."
1,Good dim sum in Las Vegas.  Prices are reasonable and about the same as Orchids Garden dim sum.  Food is good and they have a better selection on the carts than Orchids Garden.  Only problems are limited parking because they are popular and the restaurant is about half the size of Orchids Garden and there can be a long wait for a table when they are busy.  Never had this problem at Orchids Garden.
0,"The Woody Allen is just HYPE. I came here for our last meal in Vegas and since we were staying at the Mirage, it was convenient. We ordered to go and went back to our rooms to enjoy a nice quiet lunch since the restaurant was bustlin' with morning brunchers. Originally we were going to order just a salad and maybe an omelet, but I let my eyes eat and so the boyfriend and I decided to split the Woody Allen. I admit, its a sight or the eyes. The meat wasn't distributed well though. I had wished they had mixed the corned beef and the pastrami together more instead of one on top of the other. Luckily we asked for extra bread so I was able to make two sandwiches out of my half of the sandwich. Yes there was THAT much meat! The meat in general was pretty dry and lacked a lot of flavors. I barely finished it and saved my second sandwich for the flight home which looking in retrospect was a darn good idea. ;) I think it tasted better on the way home all soggy than it did fresh. I am SOO happy we ordered fries because it was probably the most enjoyable part of the meal! It was perfect shoe string fries, well fried and seasoned! Order this and skip the woody allen. Their menu is extensive so I'm sure you'll find something\n\nWe didn't get charged for sharing which I'm thinking is because we ordered it togo. Awesome! Just some food for thought!"
1,"Very good the pizza, with Bottega and Arlequino is one of the best pizzeria in Mtl. Or at least one of the most similar to the real Italian pizza. The place is a bit small, better to reserve. \nPs. The fifth star of the rating is also due to the Montenegro, one of the few places that have it!!!"
0,"Usedto come here all the time in high school, but it has slowly become more and more ghetto. A decent mall, cheap stuff."
1,"We make an annual trip to Scottsdale Az for Spring Training and have been staying here the past 4 years.  Rooms are very spacious and very clean.  Only a short cab ride away from old town scottsdale and nobody can compete with their rates.  When we come down here, we're not vacationing to stay in our room all wknd so I dont get the negative reviews regarding this place.  It's not a Hyatt but for $70 a nt for a suite thats kept up, clean and includes free wifi, u cant go wrong.  Highly recommend this place especially if you're headin to the dessert for some spring baseball.\n\nThe only downside is they have a shuttle that apparently is never in service because apparently there's always something wrong with it. For that reason had to take one star away."
1,"Wolfgang is one of my favorite mainstream chefs.  I'm in love with his style of cooking, overall restaurant decor and lack of stuffiness.\n\nThe food was amazing.  We got a bottle of wine and shared the raviolis and Lobster BLT.  The portions were off, the ravioli dish was on the dainty side and the sandwich was massive and enough to feed two.  No big deal, but the price didn't justify the vast size difference.  OMG - let's not forget the delicious fries.  They were so good, the idea of ketchup scared me.  \n\nAlthough a little gaudy (but hey, isn't that Vegas) it was really fun to sit inside/outside.  I felt I was in a cartoon sitting in the palazzio of Venice.     The host and service was great with us; I was debating between the lobster BLT and linguini and clams and with conviction, \""hands down the BLT.\""  She was NOT wrong there!"
1,"This poker room is nice. Good dealers, good servers, reasonable floor managers. Occasional sighting of name pros. I liked that the 1/3 PLO here actually ran like a true 1/3, and not a 1/3 mandatory $10 straddle.\n\nThe only slight knock is that the lighting is a bit too dark and that it has less tables and action than Venetians room.\n\nWould come back here many times!"
1,"Went there for dinner last night...last day during our stay at MB.  Would I give this place five stars on every night?  Perhaps not, but on this night it was excellent.  Our server (James) was efficient and friendly with great recommendations.  Attentive servers all around to clean our table when necessary and provide drink refills.  The \""Crispy Rice\"" appetizer is very good...just bite the bullet on the price at $21...I've not had anything like it.  We also ordered three sushi rolls (spicy tuna, yellowtail and spicy salmon), the green beans side and vegetable tempura.  I would pass on the tempura...not a lot of flavor and you don't get much given the cost."
1,"This is the best Motel 6 I've ever visited.  $50/night in Scottsdale, and the rooms look great - new, European furnishings.  I asked to be in the back, and it was super-quiet.  This place is awesome."
1,"Had friends staying at the Gold Coast, we ate at the restaurant, great service, great food.  I'm not much on Asian cuisine, but this was great, lots of food and even my friends commented how great it was, and they found their new favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas..  The waiter was very informative and helpful, took the time to explain things on the menu we didn't know about or understand."
0,"This is a HORRIBLE Pizza Hut location. I don't know what their problem is. I've had orders messed up five different times now. One of the times the manager gave me a credit for a free pizza, yet next time I called in the other manager said that I couldn't have it for free, but only a discounted price. THEY HAVE AN ACCOUNT FOR ME ON FILE, it's not like I just pulled that out of my A** when I called back!!\n\nOur food has been incorrect, things have been missing, and it has shown up bone dry before. No fun, and they don't even act like they care when you call.\n\nThe latest debacle this evening was the wings. I like my wings saucy. Shouldn't be a problem, right? A long time ago, I ordered their wings and they were mostly dry. So from that point forward, I ordered extra sauce, which you have to pay 50 cents more. Yet every time I did that, the wings were drowning in sauce, so I didn't even need the extra sauce on the side. I kept paying for extra sauce for no reason. Tonight, I orders wings (no extra sauce) and just put a note to make sure the wings were sauced well. \n\nMy order is delivered...NO blue cheese that I paid money for, and the wings have spots where there isn't any wing sauce on them at all. Seriously??!!!!!\n\nI called and spoke with an extremely unhelpful guy, he sounded young. He wasn't listening to what I was trying to say and at one point said that I could order my wings without sauce on them. WTF my problem is that you guys don't put enough sauce on them!!! He then went on to say that my note said extra sauce and since I didn't pay they didn't put it on. Yet A) my note never said \""extra\"" and B) I always got the phone call from them in the past saying if you want extra sauce you have to pay the driver 50 cents. No phone call this time. I assumed that my directions in basic English would be clear to the average Pizza Hut worker. He said it's how they \""interpret\"" the note.\n\nThere is another Pizza Hut location closer to me, but for some reason this is the one that is assigned my address for delivery. Apparently the credit that they wanted to give me for the blue cheese is only good if I order from their location again. What a joke. I told them to not bother with the credit and hung up.\nI guess from now on we will only be eating Pizza Hut if we want to pick up our order, since we're done with this location for good."
0,"The Marquee Theatre is pretty much like going to your horrible mother-in-laws house. Its a terrible idea that you fret over.. But you go because there is some bomb ass reward, like a home cooked meal, chocolate mousse pie and a bottle of champagne not even your wealthiest friend could afford, and because well, you have to, to keep your marriage together. The Marquee is like this. I go because one of the loves of my music life are playing a show there and I wouldn't miss it for the world.. I cant miss it!\n\nI basically hate every single thing about this place. I literally get bummed out when my favorite bands pass through Phoenix and choose to play at this shithole. \n\nThe sound sucks, the bar is almost impossible to get through to, order 2 at a time to be safe, and don't expect the bartenders to be friendly. I know there are a million people there trying to get drunk, but come on, laugh a little bit. Do something besides yell and question my completely legit ID. Its hot, dirty, the bathroom situation is a disaster. I don't even know how so many grown ass women can destroy a bathroom like the ones at Marquee, but I think it might be safe to assume dudes use the ladies room from time to time. Either that or bitches are peeing on the floor and TeePeeing the stalls for fun. Its absolutely baffling. Lines are long, parking is a nightmare, your best bet is to park elsewhere and walk. Don't piss off the security guards either, they are all obviously raging roid monkeys that will kick you out for even looking at them wrong. And one thing I HATE the most, they stamp your hands so much that it looks like a 4 year old took a box of markers to your hand,  with ink that doesn't come off for 4 days. Cant you just give me a neon colored wrist band and call it a day? I have enough ink on my body as it is.\n\nLike I said, I only come here because I have no choice, and yes, I will continue to come here.. I just hope one day Phoenix opens up a venue comparable to the size of Marquee, but actually turn it into a place you want to go to, not just because you have to.\n\nThe end."
0,"Dear Cafe Boa,\n\nI stopped by a little over a week ago to order catering services for an event I had yesterday for 30 people.  I was dismissed by the hostess as you were too busy seating people for dinner.  \n\nSaddened by your complete lack of interest, I left my name and number with the hostess for someone to contact me.  Alas, you never called. \n\nI just wanted to send you a little thank you...\n\nSince you never called, I had the event catered by Postino Winebar. The event was a fabulous success, everyone loved the food and will be visiting Postino for many dinners and lunches to come.\n\nNow that I know how attentive, reasonably priced and easy to work with Postino is, they will be catering all of our events for 2010.  \n\nWithout you, I might have never found them.\n\nHugs and Kisses,\nJim\n\nUpdate: The owner/manager has since emailed me saying the service issue would be rectified.  Having dined here many times before, the service is indeed usually much better."
1,I stopped by around 2pm it wasn't very busy and the girls that worked there were very friendly and extremely helpful. I ordered a dozen cupcakes and became the cupcake fairy for the day. It was my day off so I spent my day dropping off cupcakes to my friends and family who haven't tried them yet. They fell in love with the cupcakes and finally understood what all the fuss is about. My favorite is the strawberry cupcake the frosting tastes like strawberry and the cake is similar to banana bread. I tried the peanut butter one and I almost barfed. I enjoy peanut butter in moderation but this was an overload. Unless you are obsessed with peanut butter I wouldn't recommend it. Black and white and marshmallow were also pretty tasty. I don't even really like sweets but I can't help but devour these cupcakes even though I always get a tummy ache after eating them :)
0,"I like Goldies and we take out often because the food is usually good but, honestly, they cannot get orders correct. Every single take out order is wrong. either they forget something or they undercook something, like wings that are called in to be well done. And when they make a mistake, they do not take responsibilty for it. They charge for everything including ranch dressing which I feel is insulting. Again the food is good but, under these circumstances, we will go elsewhere."
0,"This review is for the two employees who happen to be working at the time, not about Geico as a whole. I have never felt so unwelcome in a business as these two associates made me feel. They were so blatantly rude and acted like we were wasting their time. I went in with a couple questions and they acted like we didn't even deserve the time of day. I have never been in a geico office thanks for the WORST FIRST IMPRESSION ever. Doesn't even deserve one star but I had to pick one"
1,"The AT&T Store employees were so helpful when I lost my phone in Montreal.  Peter helped me get a temporary phone and a new one sent to me within 48 hours.  He could not have been more helpful!  And today I went back to have my bill explained to me, and Jay let me know what the charges were for and helped me understand my plan.  5 stars!"
0,"I try to avoid this airport at all costs while connecting to other destinations.  The terminals have no tram or train and are VERY far apart from each other.  On more than one occasion the people-movers have been down for repair which makes that feature even more annoying.\n\nThe bathrooms have this hallway that is only wide enough for ONE person to fit through which makes going through with bags entertaining; especially when a flight arrives and the area is crowded with passengers rushing to the restrooms.  Yes, that's \""one person\"" for both directions.\n\nThen to add to the fun there was a last minute gate change AND it took them 20 minutes to get the jet-way to the plane.  Good times."
0,"I will not write an entire story here so as not to bore everyone.  However this place and the people who work there rank in the very bottom/worst tier of customer service.  There was not a single thing that was done correctly by any of the agents.  Among the things that went wrong and were true pain-points:\n- Could not initially pull up reservation, even through I had the number and copy with me.\n- Pulled up a completely different reservation (under someone else's name) and didn't notice it until I pointed it out just before signing things.\n- All the computers crashed in the office and they had to resort to pen/paper.\n- I watched as agents next to me tried to suck every dollar they could out of the reservation by trying to convince everyone to purchase insurance.  It honestly appeared they tried to make it confusing and almost scare people to agree to getting insurance.  I understand offering it, but this was well beyond that.  Further, two of these people were very old and had a hard time understanding everything - I really felt bad for them as the agents were anything but helpful and patient and understanding.\n- Mysteriously was charged ~40% more upon returning the car, to which no one knew why when I went to the desk to inquire.\n- Throughout the entire experience and after while trying to resolve my problems, I was promised a call 4 times - never received a single call.  I have sent two emails to the \""manager\"" - I have not received any reply.\n\nNeedless to say, this place is just horrible and deserves -5 stars.  However, it's hard to say it is better/worse than any other car rental place as they all seem to give you nightmare experiences frequently.  I'd try any other place than Budget at LAS Airport - it may not be better but hopefully won't be much worse."
1,"I can't say enough good things about the style and quality of food here.  Simply prepared with high quality ingredients, the unique food and preparation speaks for itself.\n\nThese type of neighborhood restaurants are always good - but this one is particularly unique in what they offer and the quality of what they serve.\n\nJoined some friends and family her the evening, shared an Ensalada, Pizza Del Cafone, Pizza Lasagna, et al - all was excellent, service was simple and efficient - food and ability to talk with the table guests was great."
0,"We decided to try out La Ristra this past week. The restaurant itself is very nice. Love the decor, colors, tables, etc. The location itself is mainly what earned it the 1 star.\n\nOur server was ok. Both my partner and I opted for the 2 entree combo meals. I had the machaca enchilada and green pork tamale. My partner had a taco and enchilada. The chips and salsa were really good, minus the mild salsa. The mild salsa had too much of a tomato taste to it. \n\nAs far as the entrees go, we were not asked if we wanted red or green for the enchiladas. The server did not seem educated on the whole idea of red and green from New Mexico. I had to ask which chile sauce came on my enchilada, as I wanted green.\n\nThe actual meal itself was very bland. I don't know if it was an off night...but if not they need to add some flavor. The only thing you tasted from the green sauce was spice. (Which I do like spicy!) The machaca was tough and not tender as it should be. The beans and rice were absolutely flavorless. Our bill was outrageous for just mediocre food. We could've gone somewhere and had a meal full of flavor for how much we paid."
1,Best pho on north end of valley.  Did take out combo pho and it was so right! 5star to me. Will return often!
0,"Ate breakfast here before my flight. I really expected more.  The service was terrible.  The egg white sandwich on a pretzel roll sounded great, but it was very poor.   There was absolutely no care in the assembly of the sandwich and the \""hash browns\"" were just a deep fried triangle potato patty.  \n\nUnfortunately it's the airport, and when you give a long term exclusive contract to one operator, there is no concern for quality."
1,"This a very nice restaurant in downtown. I had dinner the day after dinning at Eiffel restaurant. It does not have a view but has everything else you may look in a nice restaurant. It feels very intimate and dinner was delicious. The cocktails are probably the best I had in Vegas and Dean the bartender is awesome. We met a couple at the bar that has been coming to this place for the past 6 years or so. That tells you a lot about a place. Do yourself a big favor and visit this restaurant, may be your best dinner in Las Vegas."
1,"This is the REAL Las Vegas Outlet! There are a few other lame run down outlets in the Las Vegas area, but make sure you go to this one, LAS VEGAS PREMIUM OUTLET!\n\nWho says there's nothing to do but gamble in Vegas? I personally hate shopping maybe it's a guy thing, but I hate looking at the same crap that's  never on sale. This outlet is great for men! I'm not into men if that's what you were thinking (that's what he said). Let me explain. Most malls are composed of 95% womens products. This is no joke! And the 5% of stores that are not women's I am counting the food court and gift shops that don't even sell clothing. I admit malls are great for guys to go window shopping for eye candy (go on ladies do your thang), but if you want some decent clothes there is no mens clothing! This outlet actually has stores that men will  shop at! Also, unisex clothing stores have a men's section and not just on rack hidden in the back of a women's store. There's nothing more embarrassing than wondering if something is your size and it turns out to be womens clothing. That's a nightmare for a straight guy. \n\nVan Heusen, Nike, Reebok, Adidas, Nautica, Calvin Klein, Keith Cole, TIMBERLAND!! One of the last Timberland stores open. Other outlets will only have a few big names and no section, but the premium outlets have what you are looking for. There's too much good stuff! Usually, I only get halfway through the outlet because I have bought too much stuff before I make it all the way through. \n\nIf you are going to shop for reals, the Las Vegas Premium Outlets is for you. If you just want to look around, still go... but you should buy something because the prices are awesome. This is a must stop everytime you go to Las Vegas. The only bad thing is you may freeze your ass off in the winter and you will melt like a ice cream in the summertime, because this is an outdoor mall. I still don't get what the designers of this mall were thinking! Outdoor mall in Vegas?\n\nWritten via blackberry"
1,"Spoiler alert--- It's a Chain Restaurant!!!!\nBut this might just be the best run chain restaurant company in America. It seems nothing has been forgotten, a solid well rounded menu, tasty well seasond meals, attracive well kept salad bar, better then very clean restrooms, well trained and informed service staff, prices from fair to great, great beverage program, and nice tastefull decor.\nI really like this place and it has been my go to restaurant for a few years. I am not big on chains, but this particular one is great. \nFor what it is, it's a solid 5 star place."
1,"I've been going to this coffee house for a while now.   I enjoy the dining experience.  I like the people and atmosphere there.   The coffee is great - with one caveat.   On occasion I've gone there during the mid-afternoon (2:30 - 3:00 pm) to do a little work on my laptop and enjoy a cup of coffee.  On every occasion the cup of drip coffee they've served me was lukewarm.    When I've brought this situation to their attention they've always corrected the problem by brewing a \""fresh batch\"" - however - a true 5-star coffee house would not wait for their customers to tell them the coffee they're serving was sub-par.\n\nI still frequent this place - I still enjoy the experience - but here's my lesson learned - if you want a good cup in the afternoon and you're going to Altitude - get the Americano or Chemex pour-over.   Steer clear of the drip coffee in the afternoon."
1,Great oceanic escape in the middle of the desert.  Wonderful place for the whole family.  Goes to show there is quality entertainment for all ages in Sin City.  Discounts for local residents too!!!
0,"I had a tremendously negative experience with hardys pool care. My pool was half drained due to a malfunction of my salt system. Water was drained , so that new water could be added. I decided since pool was half empty, this would be the ideal time to have the pool acid washed. My regular company did not have openings for a month, so I turned to the Internet and found hardy's.  The owner stated he could come the next am. I told him I was working but could pay my neighbor to stay and open gate ect. He stated he would be there btwn 830-9. At 11, nobody had appeared. I called 5 x, left vm 2x. No response. So... I hady neighbor call and say he needed an acid wash... Amazingly the phone was answered at hardy's. When my neighbor explained the actual situation. The owner stayed he wpuld call me. He did not per my phone log. I finally reached him, he said he was at the wrong address and agreed to come the next day, making little apology or offer to reimburse me for my efforts. The next day he came and acid washed pool w my neighbor supervising. The tile looks great, the pool looks terrible, very streaky. He also did not add the 5 bags of salt he promised. I paid an extra $50 for this. He claims I never told him it was a salt system ( a lie). I have asked him many times to rectify the situation. He has not responded. I highly regret doing business with this company."
0,"I'll be honest. I do not like writing bad reviews, but, I have had way too many bad experiences at this KFC to not comment. I have been coming here on and off for several years. The facility has been renovated and looks amazing. The bathrooms are always clean, but that is where the positive stops. \n\nMost of the time my order is wrong when going through the drive through. Often times there is no flat ware with my order. The wait is always long inside and in the drive through, even when there are no customers in line. I waited in line inside for over 30 minutes with no customers in front of me and no one else waiting for food. Then, my order was wrong. The staff are not necessarily unpleasant, but certainly not customer focused. The food is inconsistent. Got 3 biscuits, one was almost raw dough and the other two were dry and crunchy. The chicken is much the same. \n\nI keep going back hoping for change, but never see any. \n\nAgain, I would usually not say anything rather than write a negative report, but this KFC has been continually under par with bad customer service, wrong orders and inconsistent food quality. Add in the long waits and this is certainly a place to avoid."
0,"Probably one of the worst restaurants in Charlotte. No Joke. The service is horrible. Bad attitude, not helpful and lazy. The food tastes like cheap frozen boxes.. The view is great, but don't eat there."
1,"We had a wonderful meal tonight with impeccable service. What a view!  This will be my new \""go to\"" place for out-of-town visitors. I hadn't dined here for many years and I was so impressed by the quality of the food.\n\nSince we came in early, we took advantage of some happy hour priced cocktails. Our entrees were the Scottish salmon and beef tenderloin -- both highly recommended! Thanks to the Chefs at Top of the Rock!"
0,"Ok I will be short but what I have to say is not so sweet. I am astounded that this place is still in business.  We went this last Saturday night and were treated horribly. After an hour of waiting for our food and not having been acknowledged by our waitress. My husband & I got up to leave. (The people next to us had fininshed thier meal and they had been seated 20 minutes after us.) We asked to speak to the Mgr. He did not come, only sent the bill for our food ( that we never had recieved) and said that he would have it wrapped up for us to go. When we stated that we wereonly going to pay for what we had been served the Mgr (then suddenly appeared &)   said that he was going to call the sherrif. I think everyone has expereinced bad service but this place literally takes the cake."
0,"Went 4 the seafood buffet on Friday. Extremely disappointed, should have been called Crab leg Buffet. Being allergic to crab and finding only limited other items, no salmon, some kind of breaded and dry halibut(?). It didn't appeal to me at all. Steamed clams, mussels and  dipping butter were all luke warm at best. Prime rib was the best thing other than the desserts. If crab wasn't one of the wife's faves it would have been a complete disaster. Way over priced. Never again."
1,"I heard about this place from an old co-worker at Green Valley Ranch, so I decided to give it a shot. If you are a GVR employee, Sandy gave a discount. Remember to ask if this still applies.\n\nI went through a stage where I have cut and dyed my hair in every possible manner and color under the sun. I put my trust completely in Sandy's magical hands. With a lion's mane and a personality just as bold, she is a hoot. She is not one of those stylists who rush you in and out, but takes time to assess, ask for what you are going for, and suggest some slight modifications if necessary. If you are in a hurry, I do not suggest this place, because she is meticulous. \n\nThe staff in this establishment are all friendly and lively. It is a welcoming environment."
1,"First of all, can Yelp afford to give 1/2 stars?  The better question is, why CAN'T Yelp(!) afford 1/2 stars?  I might have given the extra 1/2 star, but for no reason at all, Yelp won't allow me that option.  I cannot believe that.  Of course Yelp must think this page is perfect and cannot be interrupted.  I disagree.\n\nI finally made it to Indulge and let me just say, I indulged.  Whoa.  The visuvio burger was great.  Moist, a damned good burger.  {Note to self: a few criticisms: \n1)wheat bun wasn't good.  It's tough and not tasty.  Ok, next time I'll try another kind of bun but the wheat bun wasn't \""my bad choice\"", it was just bad.\n2) if I order mushrooms on the burger, who said I wanted mushrooms on the side?  Mustard, ketchup, mayo...same thing.  Ordered it, wanted it, PUT IN ON THE DAMNED BURGER!!!   I want it ON THE BURGER!   But that's just me.  I could be wrong.}\n\nWhat DID impress me the most here wasn't even the burger I was eating.  It was what the guy next to me was eating.  Seriously.  Here I was, eating a really immense burger, juicy, delicious but what kept catching my eye was the Salmon Salad the guy was eating next to me.  And it didn't help that he was savoring EVERY SINGLE BITE..\n\nAnd a joint that's friendly, clean (very), can do a fabulous gigumbo burger...AND a delicious looking Salmon Salad, that's a good joint.\n\nI say thumbs up~!!!!"
0,Reserved a car for noon. Showed up late (my fault) to find they rented my car to someone else; didn't bother to call me (their fault). Both employees were on the phone when we got there and didn't bother to acknowledge us for at least 5 minutes. They said they could get me another car from another location if I was willing to wait 45 min. So Make sure you call or show up on time because their inventory is like 2 cars.
0,"I'm surprised by the number of good reviews for J & G.  I've been there twice and felt the same each time - mediocre food, nothing special at all.  You would think The Phoenician hotel would ensure they have a great restaurant but J&G will not be on my list of places to repeat.  Sure, it's a nice space but the food is blah, expensive and certainly not on par with the costs."
0,I've always liked the setup at Tao but beware of getting a table at this place. We got a table $1500 min right next to the dj booth. As we were half way through our second bottle I closed the tab. Within a few minutes someone from the club management came to us and said we can't have more than 10 people at our table. That is the most ridiculous thing I've heard. The reason to get a table is so you can bring guests over. Several of our guys had to leave our table for most of the night and hang out by the bar so we could have a few female guests over. We finally got a third bottle and the management left us alone.
0,"I now know why this place was empty during our visit.  Terrible service... and Service is EVERYTHING!  There are plenty of places to eat in this city, think twice before choosing Ruby Tuesday Marketplace."
1,"Meatballs and beer!\nThis was a grand experience. The food and nice full beer selection were only surpassed by the excellent service. We visited this place on a busy Saturday night and it was packed. Loud by fun atmosphere. Classic Beef with arribiatta, Spicy Pork with creamy parmesan, Chicken with spinach-almond pesto all delish however the Beef was a little bland. I got them in slider form but I would have preferred them In the Saucy Balls. The problem is you cannot mix your balls. With this many choices you should have an option that lets you sample more balls at a time. That would be my only criticism. on the other hand the mushroom arancini were so good I would go back just for them. we also had the tomato risotto and escarole & beans were adequately prepared but nothing to brag about. Plenty of fine drafts on tap and when I say excellent service, I mean it.  I can't wait to go back and try the upper levels.\nNote to owner: BALL SAMPLER!"
1,So far so good
0,"I hate to give 1 star, so 2 will do. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here for dinner around 6:00 on a Sunday evening, it looked a little busy so the 10 minute wait for a booth sounded great! The manager apologized and I assured him we were fine with that.\n\n \nFirst, the poor hostess was so lost and confused,  she was wondering around looking so stressed out trying to help buss tables, looked like her first job. The busser was no where to be found I only saw him twice the whole night, it almost seemed as if he was washing dishes and didn't have time to buss. The whole night we sat with the last tables dirty cups and dishes stacked above our head at the booth.\n\nSecond, Our bartender was our server so I expected a little wait, no one brought us bread until we asked, and when brought out it was just thrown on the table, no oil was served or anything,  nobody even introduced themselves. Meanwhile,  our order went in at 6:20 at 6:50 our main dish was served, it looked as if it was sitting on the counter for 15 minutes and a little cold, but wasn't to big to complain so we just asked for some extra sauce to moist it back, by 7:10 the extra sauce was delivered as well as our appetizer salads... My boyfriend has order the chicken parmesan,  he asked for bowtie noodles and unfortunately got thick string noodles.\n\nHey my pinapple mojito was delicious!!\n\nFinally, our check was brought out our bartender apologized for the horrible service he knew was served and comped everything from our bill except  our salads, I was thankful.\n\nI wanted to add a server in particular,  unfortunately I do not know his name, but I made sure I went out of my way to thank him for everything because he was the one making sure we ordered, our food was delivered, our condiments were brought out, refilled waters, he basically did everything, defiantly the only one who could hold his composure at a busy rate."
0,"So, one star is hard for me to give, but Beijing was an utter disappointment. Livin in the area, I love trying new places and Chinese, even better. So, driving home Friday night I spotted Beijing. Got home, checked out the menu and called for pickup. I ordered the Shrimp with broccoli dinner special which includes rice, egg roll, and your choice of soup. I chose the spring roll and wonton soup. I was quoted 15 minutes and when I arrived my order was ready. And, there were multiple people picking up orders as well as diners in the restaurant. A good sign in my mind, not!\nThe wonton soup was brown, see photo. Never having seen a brown soup I was a little nervous and I was right, nasty taste. The rice was so blah and the shrimp and broccoli was covered in a thick brown sauce that has a horrible taste and the shrimp tasted very fishy. As for the spring roll, pure grease. All I will say is the fortune cookie was the only thing about the meal I enjoyed. I will definitely not be back. Bummer, because it is convenient to me."
0,"Worst Apple Store Ever. (If you're an American)\n\nThis is a store that is frequently visited by Las Vegas foreign tourists. I'm not slamming anyone for pointing that out, but it is a major factor in why this is such a different store than the rest. The employees simply don't care or try. You walk in and there is NOBODY that will greet you, and thats because they know they'll make their sales regardless of their efforts. The \""tourists\"" are going to buy no matter what and they know it so the employee (and management) effort is minimal."
1,"Had lunch today...My lunch pal had the BLTA and I had the SW Chicken Wrap.  Thank you so much for using a quality tortilla and not some flavored one that has so much preservative on it that it tastes like wax!!  The chicken had VERY good flavor and it was a good size.  I got the side salad with it and while I feel they were a bit skimpy with the salad, it was still good.  The fries were very tasty!  Crispy and flavorful.  Loved the decor too!  This place beats the heck out of Kneaders.....I am happy to pay $8 for a lunch I am going to like!"
0,"Decently priced.. But not for the hassle I had to go through. As soon as I was done with my oil change, I'm leaving the parking lot and notice there's a nail in my tire.. So I go back and he rushes to grab his card and sends me to discount tire to get it patched. As I'm leaving discount tire, I check to see if one of my screws are missing. Sure to find out, one of the srews are missing to my skid plate and it was the one in my tire. I call back to tell them. He rudely tells me to bring it back and as I start to get a tad bit frustrated on the phone, I was HUNG UP ON. I try to call back about 4-5 times, no answer. I call another location to get the corporate number and try calling back this location. Shiloh answers and tells me I have an attitude and basically to please stop cursing if I want help and proceeds to hang up on me as well. I shouldn't have to calm down because you guys don't know how to put things back the way you find them. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CANT PUT YOUR CAR BACK CORRECTLY."
1,E-Jo is a Korean Sul lung Tung Soup House which is boilled beef soup. The choices are what cuts of meat you want in your soup. There are some other options and the hangover soup has spicy bean paste added. The grilled meat start at $17 per plate. The soup is good and the Kimchi is excellent. But the green onion topping is very roughly cut. \n\nService is good but English is limited so you need to use the menu item numbers. Great place to get a hot piping bowl of beef soup.
1,"I took my wife here for our anniversary last year and it was really nice. Upon arrival they were extremely friendly. They new it was our anniversary so they had a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberrys waiting in our room. The hotel, amenities, service, and overall appearance left nothing to be desired. A truly great stay with a great couples massage in the morning. Great place to relax or getaway. 5 stars from me!"
0,"I MUST talk about the food at this place!!\n\nOkay, it was only recently that I decided to really try their food. and it was soo yummy! One time, I had a gyro and a seesh thoola (is that spelled right?) The second sandwich was a grilled chicken dish wrapped in a pita. it was so good! Their olive oil is quite good. The gyro was good too - a little greasy for my liking, but still yummy. \n\nAnother time I went - i went with a couple of friends and we brought it down! We had a kebab combination. My friend had just a chicken kebab and I had a lamb kebab and the sheeh thoola combo and my other friend had just the lamb. It came with salad and hummus and pita as well as our entrees and rice and this one side dish of feta cheese, tomatos and i think sage? I didn't get to eat it because my friend ate it all! damn her! \n\nThe hummus and pita was DELICOUS! and the rice was amazing. The kebabs were a little dry - I gotta admit but everything was good. I was really surprised. I thought it wasn't going to be that great. I wish we sat at a table becuase eating in their lil booths with just pillows on the floor was not very easy. We all got leg cramps that night. \n\nBut seriously - the service is SHIT! There's this guy who is their waiter - if you're not a FEMALE under 25 and WHITE and BLONDE and a size ZERO and have HUGE tits... he does NOT give a shit about you! and that's REAL! I am SO not lying!! I've have been to this establishment atleast a dozen times and everytime - the story's the same. We go up and order our hookah... this employee takes the order is seems rather pissed to do so. I give him my ID and credit card and sit down with a couple of menus.\n\nSEVERAL minutes later, our hooka comes and then we order our drinks and another quarter hour later our drinks come and then he seems CRAZY annoyed that we actually want food. I never care and just order anyway. There's been a couple of times when my friends wanted to eat somewhere else because of this guy's attitude. We order anyway. He reluctantly takes our order. We sit and wait... and wait... and wait... I search the room for him and there he is... standing over some girl's clevage as she giggles and twirls her hair. and FINALLY (one time 40 minutes later) we get our food. a-hole supreme usually plops our plates down and gives us more coles and is GONE. We never get refils on our drinks unless we beg another employee who seems like he's 15 years old.\n\nWhen we're done - we flag him over from yet another table where he's now hovering over a different cleavage since cleavage number 1 has left. and he clears the tables and leaves us yet again. Until we're done smoking and then finally go to the register to pay. When i think about it... the service really does suck! but the food is so good and so is the hookah. I've come close to telling off the waiter of the year - but the tobacco and food always calm me down. :P"
1,I wasn't impressed by my carne asada buritto-it was ok. I am VERY burrito picky! Some friends rave about this place-so I ordered what they get: the carnitas plate. I love it! It may break my burrito habit.\nNow if I could only find the perfect burrito in vegas.
0,"My Pathetic lunch in all it's glory before a single bite. \nAt least the portions of this 9 dollar lunch were tiny so I didn't have much to toss out after I tried it. Bland, over cooked and greasy. Just three tiny pieces of meat (about 1.5 bites total) and some canned peas in greasy tomato sauce. Greasy lettuce garnished with a single slice of tomato. They couldn't even bother to give me a fork despite asking for one twice. \nNot going back here again. Disgusting, they should be ashamed of serving such disgusting and overprice food."
1,"All in all, this is one of my fave spots to go for sushi here in the valley, mostly because of the japanese soda's, Most other places don't have them which sux!  \n\nservice here is always great, fast seating times even with larger groups.  Sushi is good as well.  No complaints"
1,"Went into Best Buy after a dismal experience at Walmart. We were looking for a camera, which also happens to be carried by Walmart. Antonio was helpful and informative, explaining the differences (both pros and cons) between similar cameras. Best Buy had the same camera at the same price, with a more friendly, knowledgeable and professional employee.\n\nI've had similiar experiences with Best Buy in the past when purchasing cellular phones. I was able to upgrade my phone, through my wireless provider, at Best Buy. The same product at the same price, but a much more customer friendly employee. I will continue to utilize Best Buy for all of my electronic needs. \n\nCustomer service is huge for me when chosing where to shop. Best Buy has never dissappointed and always seems to put the customer first. Too many other places don't place enough emphasis on customer service.  I will definitely return to Best Buy."
1,"I was visiting from Los Angeles for my little sister's birthday & was skeptical because I'm usually a \""stick with what I know\"" kind of person. Oh, & I'm serious about my cupcakes! =) Well, Cupcake Lane did NOT disappoint! They were exceptional. My sister was excited & loved them. I will recommend them to all my local friends. Thank You!"
1,"Every service that I have tried at The Loft has been amazing!  My hair stylist, Jodi Glibert, is one of the best (and the most reasonably priced) that I have ever used!  Jodi is very friendly and professional.  She does not attempt to sell you every product in the store, either!\n\nStacey Fishberg has been my aesthetician since I have lived in Las Vegas, and is absolutely wonderful as well!\n\nThe Loft has a very relaxed atmosphere that offers many cute boutique accessory items to peruse while you are waiting for your appointment!"
1,Sushi here is A+ ; come here during happy hour though that's when you'll get the best value for your dollar! Plus the happy hour menu is awesome.
1,"So interactive!  And the design of the place was unreal.  Loved taking the boys, but would definitely consider returning without the kids too (to take full advantage of all the interactive exhibits and activities that were hard to stop and participate in with a 3 year old wanting \""to go see something else\""."
0,Wow great pizza great food. But they have list there way on customer service do yourself a favor and go to the origanal location were there cool. The lady that runs the flamingo location needs to wake up. Customer service is king I will drive 3 more miles for service.
1,"MIM is a must! If you are someone who moderately enjoys museums, this is for you! It's probably the most approachable museum I've ever been to. The only issue is that it's a bit more expensive than the other museums so if you are bringing a friend, it's $50 with the special exhibit."
1,Holy crap I hate vegas and clubbing.  Put them together and I am in hell.  Fat people don't club.  We just eat club sandwiches.  This place was freaking amazing!  Cover was $50 which is the most I have ever paid to get into a club without getting a steak.  Freakin insane.  All of the asians and their moms from LA pretty much drove 4 hours to meet here. The venue is freaking awesome.  Some fatties paid $100 during labor day weekend.  SuckAZ!  This is probably one of the best clubs I have ever been too.  It was that good.
1,"I love this place. It doesn't look like much but they make excellent indian food from scratch. They will do any substitution you need and ask for. If you eat there rather than getting your food to go you will get very generous portions for a decent price. They also have wide selection of indian desserts and snacks, most of which are made fresh daily.\n\nIt's family owned, if you are nice to them they will be very nice and helpful to you!"
1,"The small business woman's best friend.  At least it was mine. Though my business was more micro than small, Kinko's helped me with everything from creating invoices to routine faxing.  The folks there have always been pretty helpful in giving ideas - though with some folks were more interested in talking to each other than helping a girl who at the time didn't know the difference between Word and Excel but needed to create a marketing document.  Ah, silly girl.\n\nNow that I'm a more savy business person, I've used their services for massive training documents and big ugly audio visual gunk.  Yea, that's about how much I cared about all that. By my favorite thing about Kinko's is their fun paper and envelopes for personal use.  It's weird to buy a card there, but when you realize you've spent the last 16 hours working on some work crap that you've been doing at that pace for the last week - you might want to pick up a mushy \""I love you\"" card for your significant other who's putting up with it all.  Or maybe a card for the Anniversary/Birthday you're missing while you go back to the office?  \n\nI'm telling you - Kinko's knows what you need before you do."
0,"Seriously? All these great ratings? I was so excited to go and was quite disappointed in a few ways...\nWe waited an hour for a table, yes the place is small, but when I see emply tables and servers staff around talking, you have to agree that the wait is not warranted.\nThe flavors of the pancakes are quite interesting and we liked the ideas when reading the menu, but the pancakes were a little thin, dry and tough - I think a fluffy pancake is worth talking about. I will admit the cream cheese syrup was totally tasty!\nCall yourself BabyCakes and the Cakes should be amazing.\nWe wouldn't go again, I can make better pancakes at home."

0,"Hands down WORST pizza I have ever had. I ordered a New York style thin crust pizza with pepperoni.  Mannn... this \""pizza\"" came out with more grease than an auto shop! The dough was thick and soggy in the middle and the cheese tasted like rubber. To top it off the waitress/bartender said \""Wow! Doesn't that look good?\""  HAHAHA SERIOUSLY?! Maybe she's never had a pizza before, but this was pure nastiness.  My bf and I just looked at each other and laughed. Sorry Nikki Lee's... nice people working there and you may make good drinks, but PLEASE refrain from calling that ball of grease on my table a \""pizza\""."
0,I stopped in for a title loan amd their commercial says 15 minutes. I was there for over 2 hours waiting. They need to change their commercials. False advertisement
1,It was my first time here today. The office looks a little outdated but the service is great. Very nice and friendly staff.
1,"This is one of my alltime favorite breakfast joints. I don't know why. The food isn't that spectacular. I think its the creativity of the items and large menu selection that sticks me. \n\nThere's also two vegetarian items that are really good: The Veggie Benny (vegetarian eggs benedict) and the Veggie Croissant (with garlic mayo so good, make me wanna slap yo momma). \n\nThey're prices are a little steep, being a breakfast place in Summerlin. And they get totally hammered during prime breakfast hours, so I'd recommend going sub primetime. They have indoor and uncovered outdoor seating. \n\nGet the coffee cake. The Kickin' Potatoes (their spunked-up version of potatas bravas) are supposed to be a signature item ... they a'ight. \n\n* off the strip, non-casino"
1,"I was super excited to come to this restaurant, especially since I'm such a big fan of masterchef and gordon ramsay. haha. Anyway, I ordered a farm burger and had regular fries and onion rings as appetizers. The burger was good - very juicy and well cooked, but I just felt like something was missing. I still enjoyed it, but I guess my expectations were a little high. The fries were fries, the onion rings were onion rings, pretty normal, but I loved the dipping sauces that came with both. They made the fries and onion rings taste amazing. I also had a milkshake (the one with oreos),  and it was SO GOOD...probably the best milkshake I had ever had. It was, however, almost $10, so i kind of expected it to be something special anyway. \n\nAll of their burgers are around $14-$16 dollars and their fries and milkshakes are all about $10. I went with my family as a party of 4 and we waited about 45 min. The service is good, the waiters are all friendly and smiley. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the experience at this restaurant. Will probably be back again the next time I go to vegas to try something new. \n\nNote: The restaurant is in the Planet Holleywood hotel, the very first restaurant when you walk through the entrance of the Miracle Mile Shops."
0,Our waitress was great. But the service was super slow. Probably cause one person was taking table orders and waiting on every table. And 4 people standing up front not doing anything but talking to each other and playing on their phones. The owner needs to start managing this place. Very disappointing for a first visit. Better pizza places right down the street
0,What happened? New owner? New management? We remember coming here and talking to the owner while he deboned a fresh piece of salmon and talked about curing and making sushi. Now the owner looks like he just stepped off the golf course and flaunts a $20 tip to sushi chefs making sushi with below grade fish. The 'Panko' tofu was good. Tonight it was Gordon's from the freezer. The yellowtail will assuredly make us sick. We will miss you Sushi Room.
1,"Delicious! Excellent Service! I had the black bean burger and it was very yummy and big!! Also, the sweet potato fries and the greens salad were quite tasty. I will definetly go back."
0,"We ate there last Saturday, before heading out to the comedy club. While it was an enjoyable dinner, I have to say I was just not impressed and will probably not return. The food looks great on their website, and the descriptions really are what made us decide to dine there. But the reality didn't meet our expectations. \n\nService was definitely A+. I have to say that much. Our server was great! He was on the ball, put up with all our crap (we had two smart-asses in the group), and kept our glasses full.\n\nOur  meals were blah all the way around...\n\nWe started with an appetizer of \""fire stix\"" - beef on a stick in a spicy sauce and fried wontons. The wontons were stale, the marinated and mequite grilled beef tasted bland and neither marinated nor mesquite grilled, and the hot sauce was more sweet than hot.\n\nThe Southwest Salad (with a Chicken breast on top) was nothing out of this world, though very tasty and I did enjoy it.\n\nOne of my companions ordered the Marguerita Pizza, of which I had a taste. It seemed like re-heated pizza. I'm not saying it was, but it TASTED that way. The crust was way chewy, and the toppings seemd to have been drying up on it for a while. My companion was not happy with it either.\n\nAnother dining companion ordered the Strawberry Spinach Salad (has apples, candied walnuts and goat cheese with a strawberry vinaigrette). She liked it, but wasn't impressed. \n\nOur fourth member had the Southwest Kobe Beef Burger and loved it. It looked great, but i can't really give a fair review on this one. He didn't give me much feedback to work with."
0,"Nonchalant attitudes all around. I felt that the customer service was quite poor. They never really cared until I came in to pay for the work I had done, which made me very surprised after reading all of the great reviews. They were also quite pricey. I will most likely not return to Honest 1."
1,I've been to several shows at the Arts Center.  The theatre is a fairly large performance area with seating for several hundred people.\n\nThis is the new home for all productions of the Rainbow Theatre Company since the building they were using on Las Vegas Boulevard was being closed and then taken over by another company.\n\nThere are rotating art exhibits here.  Parking is available in the lot and on street.  Last night's production of Charlotte's Web was very well done!  The kids do a great job!
1,"So I shouldn't eat refined carbohydrates...but if I'm goin to Lo-Lo's I'm gonna tear it up! I took my niece Ivy on Monday...actually she paid so who took who, right? Anyway...we arrived right at 9am when they opened and sat right down. The waiters were cool and cute...made sure the table was freshly wiped down and brought the high chair for baby John Ford with a smile. I ordered the #2 Baby Ray...3 smothered chicken thighs with gravy and onions, 2 waffles, and a side of grits, and even though I suffer from \""Sugar Diabetis\"" as my family still calls it...yeah, I admit my white trash culture...I ordered a jar of Red Kool-Aid Drank. Man...it's worth the risk of diabetic coma...the sweetest Kool-Aid Drank ever...tastes like summer! The food was amazing as always...the waffles have a hint of cinnamon ...smothered in butter didn't even need the warm syrup! The chicken was delicious, and the grits were creamy and soooo comforting! My niece said Lo-Lo's was the best chicken and waffles she ever had...and she's had 'em in Oakland!!! \nWe were both very disappointed there was no red velvet cake...but had sock-it-to-me instead that was like pound cake on crack! Like a cinnamon roll banged a pound cake! \nI spent the rest of the day napping and farting...heaven!"
0,"Awful. Really just awful. \n\n-Staff members were extremely rude. For example, we were standing by the bar waiting for drinks for 15 minutes. Not one bartender acknowledged us. So, I politely asked the bartender who was cleaning glasses, if he could help us. He told us he was busy and we should go to the other side of the bar. \n-Rarely saw a waitress in the casino. So, we had to go back to the bar and get our own drinks. Lame.\n-The rooms felt like a cheap chain motel, rather than a Vegas experience. The room really wasn't clean. When we opened the armoire to watch TV and found old food and snacks. Gross! Super loud at all times of day or night. Old room service trays sat in the hallways for more than 24 hours. I even watched hotel employees walk right by the tray and do nothing about it.\n- Their activities fee is lame. You pay to use their gym and pool through this fee. There is not an option to skip thee fee by not using the gym or pool. \n-Overly aggressive sales people every ten feet. After we checked in we had to walk through the casino/shopping area to get to our room. I was hassled by this woman (who had a leathery wrinkled face) trying to sell me a makeover and her anti-wrinkle products. I said no thanks and walked away. She followed me, yelling how I should get this makeover. She just wouldn't let it go. I swear I thought she would follow me to my room.\n- Their internet is a joke. It only somewhat works in the room, but mostly not. Plus, you can only use it one one device. I just used LTE. \n- Hubby got bad food poisoning from the mussels he ate at one of their restaurants (LaProvencial) . We ate and drank exactly the same things except the mussels. I was fine. Just a rotten way to end a vacation.\n\nWill never, ever be going back here again for any reason."
1,"I am a pretty handy person with do it yourself tasks, but when it comes to pool care, I am a fish out of water.\n\nFor the the 5+ years l lived in Arizona, Desert Sparkle kept my pool in perfect condition.  I supplied chlorine tablets, and they handled everything else.  Thanks to Steve, who provided the weekly service, the only thing I had to consider when it came to my pool was which bathing suit to wear.  He kept me aware of any issues with the equipment, and even made friends with my dog.  :)\n\nIn addition to the weekly pool service, Desert Sparkle handled the annual maintenance of my DE filter as well as any other repairs that came up.  When my pool vacuum started to have issues, they provided me with a loaner unit until I could get a replacement.  Pool vacuums aren't inexpensive, and they provided recommendations on which units were the best in terms of performance and value, which I appreciated.\n\nWhen I moved out of state and my house was on the market for sale, I knew I did not have to worry about my pool continuing to look perfect.  Since my home was vacant, Steve even put a wire tie on my back gate latch to discourage anyone from paying an unwelcome visit to my back yard.  Nice to know someone was looking out for me!\n\nOverall I was very impressed with the service provided by Desert Sparkle.  If you are looking for honest, reliable pool care, give them a call!"
0,"Famous Dave's reinforces the thought that chains suck. I had such a bad experience back in April 2011 when this location opened that I didn't go back for awhile. 14 months later I finally decided to give them another try and place a carry out order. \n\nThe person who took my order over the phone was nice and helpful. Apparently there is a special website: famousdaveslv.com that has the local menu on it which differs somewhat from the national menu. After taking a look at it we settled on mac & cheese from the kids menu with a side of spiced apples, Texas Beef Brisket with spicy mac & cheese and cole slaw, and a BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side of Wilbur Beans. $29 got us three little black plastic boxes and a styrofoam cup of milk for the kids meal. \n\nSo when we get it home we open the bag up and we're looking at $30 worth of food and we're like where's it at? Appearances / non-standard portion sizes aside, it didn't taste much better and all the Rich & Sassy sauce you can smother it with didn't help. The brisket was over cooked and tasted like double corrugated cardboard. The spicy apples looked like someone dumped a big spoonful of spice on top and it looked bad and tasted like crap. The BBQ chicken? Awful! Bleech! Boring, flat, I thought this was BBQ? It sure doesn't taste like any BBQ I know! And being from Kansas City, one of the 4 established American capitals of BBQ I know BBQ. \n\nI could go on and on but the fact is the dog ate well last night with half the brisket going to him, my 2 year old ended up spitting out the mac and cheese and the apples, and pretty much everything else ended up being put in a nice 30 gal plastic trash bag for Republic Services to take it where it belongs. The landfill. It was so bad I found myself thinking Sysco's horrible \""BBQ\"" meat - just add their special food service sauce\"" would have tasted better than this slop. \n\nI promised my wife that for as long as we live in Vegas, I will never ask her to have Famous Dave's again. Ugh, why did I torture my family by thinking this would be any good? They deserve better, and so do you. Don't go here.\n\nEdit: After finishing writing this review I looked over at the dog bowl and the brisket is still there. He even moved it out of the way to get to the dog food under it. Seeing that I created a new list: Even the Dog won't eat it. And my dog likes almost everything so this is kinda weird when he won't touch it."
1,"Buzz, buzz, buzz about Eat for a while now.  I wanted to see what the buzz was about, too, so myself and a friend showed up last Friday at 7:00am, eager to get our breakfast Eat on and....it was closed.  Both the Eat website and Yelp have the hours as opening at 7:00am Monday through Fridays, but that is no longer true as we discovered.  The new opening time is 8:00am.  Disappointed to say the least, we settled on DuPar's for pancakes--it's nice to have a backup downtown!  Round 2:  we showed up today at 8:00am and they were open for business--yes!  Both the beignets and the pancakes looked tempting, but I wanted to try something not sweet for once, so I went with the Shrimp and Grits with bacon.  Our waitress described it as being served in a big bowl with the bacon strips, then the grits, 3 big shrimp, topped by pico de gallo--that's what I got and it was GOOD!  I never eat something so heavy for breakfast, but I liked the combination, being sure to get each part of the dish in each spoonful--very creative and delicious.  I tried my friend's dish, the Huevos Motulenos, which I didn't order only because I don't do spicy food.  If you have the spicy gene, you should order it; I had a bite and it was also delish.  Service was excellent and the space itself is very comfy and clean.  I love having places like this springing up Downtown.  I'll definitely be back for lunch and to try the beignets--just please update the business hours so others don't show up at 7:00am and walk away, sad and hungry."
0,"We like Mexican food, and this was only 'food' from the standpoint that we were no longer hungry afterwards, but unfortunately also regretful for having invested time in chewing... and waiting.  Allow me to explain... The trio of salsas brought out with tortillas as we were seated were all but tasteless.  The 'made just for you, table-side guacomole' was too salty, too much lime juice, not enough avocado - the ratios just weren't right, and this was sadly the theme of the meal.  The ceviche was OK, but was almost exclusively shrimp... where was the lobster that was also supposed to be in this pricey appetizer?  Obviously, ceviche needs acid to 'cook' the protein, but the acid wasn't balanced or complex.  So the tastes of salt and lime where first, middle and last.  We've had much better for much less cost in places less exotic than Las Vegas, such as Chicago. \n\nThe considerable lag between tortillas and 'real food' was annoying and the music was loud.  The saturation of red in the decor was interesting from the outside but more gloomy than mood-setting once we were seated and the images on the video screens were jarring and did not contribute positively to enjoying food. \n\n I ordered two appetizers and a side as my meal, wanting to try a wider variety of their offerings that just an entree might have provided.  Queso Fundido - primary taste: salt.  Stringy cheese is always fun, but that was the highlight of my meal, this generous portion of blah.  I adore goat, but this could have been any kind of stringy, salty but otherwise tasteless protein, a mealy mastication chore.  I can't remember what the 'side' was called, but was disappointed that it was regular button mushrooms smothered in a heavy, all-but-tasteless cream.  I have never tried properly prepared corn smut and was hopeful that this was what I'd be getting.  But, no.  For those of you who might be curious, \""Huitlacoche (\""wee-tlah-KOH-cheh\""), also referred to as Mexican corn truffle, can be eaten either cooked or fresh.\""  My husband's black beans were not as satisfying as any you could have gotten from a can and his chile rellenos (sp?) where apparently plated cold because they welded together into a dough ball with cheese in the middle.  Our overwhelming impression was food that was unimaginatively interpreted/prepared/presented, over-salted and only appropriate for the most flaccid of tastebuds. \n\nI gave a '2' because the pitcher of margarita was pretty good, though I am not a liquor connoisseuse.  On the other hand, the number of antacids needed to help put the memory of this meal behind us should be the better indicator of 'don't bother with this place'."
0,Totally not a bad place but my experience was a bit tainted by one of the staff. He had his jeans LOW and his underwear hanging out (trendy I know) but he always seemed to be on the verge of losing his britches. He handled his underwear as much as he handled menus and food. Thats an issue.\n\nI would have told the manager but there didn't seem to be one.\n\nThis place will get better as it matures and a lot of the initial new hire crew is separated out and we find out who is wheat and who is chaff.
0,"I asked him to do an ombre on my hair. It took two hours and I had to leave early which was unfortunate because hes a very nice guy to talk to, but when I came out it was not an ombre, it was like dip dye. An ombre is supposed to be like a gradient, right? Yeah no my hair is now half black half blonde and not worth the money and damage. Now I have to dye the blonde portion a burgundy black every month so it doesnt look like I had a 13 year old do my hair.\n\n Kenfield is a nice guy, but he really did screw up my hair. :/"
1,"First time eating here. Won't be the last.\nCame in with my lady. Ordered carne asada fries, adobada burrito, barbacoa tacos and cheesecake chimis.\n\nAsada fries were good, nothing that sets it apart from other asada fries.\n\nAdobada burrito was the best pork I've had at a Mexican restaurant within this price range.\n\nBarbacoa tacos were exceptional, well flavored and fresh veggies.\n\nCheesecake chimis were the bomb. Ate mine in 2 bites.\n\nThis is one of the best Mexican restaurants at its price range. I will be coming here again for sure.\n\nOwner is super nice too."
1,"I have heard so many friends rave about Earls that I feel like I've been here a thousand times.  Finally I can put an end to all the \""you've got to try Earl's\"" and \""you've never been to Earl's?\"" and \""dude, Earl's is amazing\"" because I ate at Earl's!!!  Is everyone quite satisfied now?\n\nThis Earl's is in the Planet Hollywood Casino which attributes to its popularity and long lines.  I don't think there is anywhere on the strip you could find a more affordable meal unless you are completely desperate and stumble towards a fast food chain like McDonald's or Subway.  Speaking of Subway, Earl's is nothing like Subway or Quiznos for that matter.  I was somewhat expecting Earl's to be like these two popular chains but fortunately, Earl's was a few hundred notches up on the sandwich ladder.  Earl has a extremely efficient ordering and sandwich production line.  I promplty received my order within a couple minutes of payment, mind you, there was quite the crowd so the speed of execution was quite impressive and would make any VP of Operations proud.\n\nWhen a place is so hyped up I'm usually faced with bitter disappointment but I'm happy to say that this time, with Earl's, I wasn't disappointed.  Mind you, it wasn't a life altering experience and harps and giggling angels didn't fill my head after the first bite but overall, it was one of my best sandwich experiences.\n\nBecause of all the hype, I took it upon myself to try as many sandwiches during my visit as possible so I promptly ordered the Original roast beef, the Earl's Club, the Italian and the Jerk Chicken along with a brownie, a Blue Moon Beer and a Coke.  Before you start pondering what a complete pig I am, I shared these with my group of 4 so everyone got a 1/4 sandwich each.  This was a great way to try a wide selection of their sandwiches, a prix fix Earl's sampling if you would.\n\nOn to the actual sandwiches. \n\nThe Original was superb.  The roast beef was juicy and flavorful, the horshradish was spicy and blended perfectly with the beef and sharp cheddar cheese.  It was light years ahead of the roast beef sandwich I had at Quiznos just a few weeks before. The Club was also very delightful with turkey and ham with fresh lettece and tomatoes.  The Italian wasn't my favorite with its Pastrami and ham combination but everyone else in my group thought it was terrific, I guess I'm not a big fan of Pastrami.  For me, the star of the show was the Jerk Chicken.  The chicken was moist and the Jerk sauce added a spicy kick to this exceptional sandwich.  The thing that made all these sandwiches special was the bread.  Only one kind of bread is served at Earl's and its their artisan white perfectly toasted.  If you believe that bread is what makes a great sandwich then Earl's should be your sandwich Mecca because you would be extremely hard pressed to find another worthy opponent.\n\nHmmmm, I seem to have written too much....I doubt any of you will actually read to this point but for those that make it this far, thanks, I'm relieved my rambling was entertaining enough to retain your attention for this long.  I guess I'll just summerize Earl's in one last line.  If you haven't tried Earl Of Sandwich, you should listen to all these 5 star Yelp reviews and take the plunge, you'll most likely become another raver like myself."
0,"BEWARE!!  I read some bad reviews about this hotel on another site and thought maybe it would be okay anyway.  Initially, it was an acceptable place to stay but not a place I would stay again because it was dirty.  But then we had a terrible customer service experience on top of that and I would never recommend this hotel to even an enemy.\n\n1. Bad customer service at the desk: We made reservations online for 4 days and on the 2nd day, we went to the front desk to change our credit card.  The manager at the front desk asked if we were checking out and we said no, we were not scheduled to check out for two days.  She kept telling us \""This is a pre-paid hotel.  If you don't pay in advance, we can't guarantee the rooms.\""  I told her that the web site has no mention of that and the person who checked us in did not tell us that.  The she said she didn't have any rooms for us and we would have to leave.  I asked what the point of a reservation was if they couldn't keep it and she continued to say several times \""This is a pre-paid hotel...\""  At that point, we went upstairs to pack our stuff and try to find other arrangements.  I was getting ready to call corporate customer service when she called and said she made a mistake and we had the room for the next two days.  She was extremely rude during the experience and she was the manager.\n\n2. General carelessness and more bad customer service at the desk: The maid left the door to our room ajar and not locked.  This was a room on the main level next to one of the open exits to the parking lot (the hotel has an open-air design where the rooms open to the the outdoors).  When we called down to the front desk, the personnel there said \""Oh well.\""\n\n3. Dirty.  The hot tub and pool had slimy stuff on the tiles.  There were broken beer bottles and cigarettes all over the ground by the garbage cans.  Everything else including the rooms were dingy.  We had a non-smoking room but it smelled like a smoking room with perfumey air freshener.\n\n4. The continental breakfast is listed as free but it costs 4.99 plus tax and it is the breakfast you get for free at equivalent hotels in the area."
0,"I went to this place a year ago because my regular optometrist in Scottsdale moved overseas.  Terrible.  I even scheduled my appointment online 2 days prior and STILL had to wait 90 minutes.  The so called \""optometrist\""  briefly looked at my chart and asked \""what's the reason for your appointment today - did your scrip expire?\""  I said it is called an ANNUAL exam.\n\nTHEN she insisted that i needed bifocals - and I explained to her that my eyes were simply exhausted from studying (16 units) and late nights.  She totally did not listen to me and said well then we will just give you regular glasses and then you will have to buy your own bifocals.\n\nshe did NOT check the general health of my eyes NOR did she ask for the reason behind why they were obviously IRRITATED.\n\nI advised her that only 1 brand of contacts works for me (cooper vision torics) and she gave me a prescription for a completely different brand.  The brand irritated my eyes and one month later she would NOT change the prescription - 6 months later the brand was recalled and they did not issue replacements or change the prescription.  I basically had 1 year of crappy contacts because I was laid off and had to stick it out. The 2 for $69 deal is a bait and switch - and they try to sell you on the membership upgrade - garbage.  i wrote to their customer service and they had NO response.  Also, they would not give you a physical prescription to get the contacts elsewhere until you bought at least ONE box in house.\n\nCHOP SHOP.\n\nI am grateful to them - because this year instead of taking my chances on another crappy eyeglass place I went and got lasik surgery.\n\nThanks you hack."
0,I love church's chicken but this location is ridiculous.  The employee are super slow and rude. I'm assuming it was the manager had his pants sagged so much you can see his sweaty marks in his undwrwear. I'll definitely be contacting Corp because if that's the manager there's a huge problem. It's weird they are so slow because all the food is already made.
1,I go to this Sprouts at least once a week. The staff is friendly 90% of the time and the produce is always fresh and well-stocked. I'm very happy to have Sprouts close to home for cheap fresh fruits and veggies.
1,"I would have to say, Both Gordon Ramsey and Robert Irving would like the menu here, its pretty short menu, and your not waking your brain trying to figure out what to get. \nI had a Omelette and OJ, the one thing I REALLY REALLY loved here was the Strawberry Jam! Best jam I EVER had! The Omelette itself, I dont know about the gravy on it, but it was good, wife went with a Omelette that had Goat Cheese on it, the Goat Cheese most diffidently had a bite to it, so not sure I would get it myself, but overall, if your looking for a good Breakfast place in the Tempe area- THIS IS A MUST GO TO place!"
1,Love coming to church here. It is uplifting everytime I get a chance to be here. Praise God.
1,"This place is nothing short of amazing. Tapas style plates. We tried the 6 course for 2 and it was like nothing I've ever had. The blending of flavors, fruits, fish, spice, etc. ah-mazing. The coconut sake was delish.  Take a cab here or walk from Palms/Rio. I wish I could eat here every day. Great service and fantastic food. Best new restraunt I've been to in a long time."
1,"I had to take a moment to rave about a waitress named Katrina at Roq. I was there for a friend's birthday brunch and from the moment we arrived Katrina was friendly, attentive, helpful, and went out of her way to meet our needs. Her customer service made such an impression on our dining experience that we asked her if she could continue to be our waitress at the pool. She agreed & consistently thought ahead, anticipating when we might need something. Her service with a smile made our celebration even better!"
0,"I used to frequent Tai Pei once a week or so, but within the last few years, it has gone severely downhill. The food is greasy, way too expensive, and they use massive amounts of MSG. I got terrible MSG poisoning from Tai Pei and ever since then, have gone to Jimmy Wan's down the road."
1,"Omgggg so! I kept hearing about these places,them n bc. In Vegas I stopped by, paid $11 a lb for hot n juicy special. 2lb minimum n it came w corn n potatoe. In total $26 bc I added sausage which was worth it. $26 was super steep bc of the name I suppose. In Texas it's the same quality just not as expensive. The food was HOT N JUICY. for ppl who like spicy,get spicy not mild. I came home from Vegas later that night n my bf made me bathe bc I smelled like it lol. It's true it stays on you but yummy. At least go once. At first I was pissed bc some of the fishtails were small."
1,"Aloha Animal Hospital is my new veterinarian for my dog. I have now been for two visits. \n\nThe docs/owners are Dr. Jamie Sulliban and Dr. Jason Sulliban. They are husband and wife and the mother of  Dr. Jason Sulliban is one of the secretaries. They treat you and your pet as if you are one of their family. \n\nThey seem to go above and beyond for their customers and their patients. I checked the mail the other day and there was a picture of my dog in the mailbox... \"" What the heck?!?!?! \"" Well it turns out it was a custom made post card with my dogs picture on it reminding me he needed his shots. I thought that was pretty cool. \n\nSo a few days later we go in for our appointment and we are greeted and my dog is given attention by everyone in there. We were put in the exam room where I see a plastic stand with a message on it. It says something like \""your dog has had a treat so here's one for you. Enjoy and the DR. will be with you soon.\"" It was a Mauna Loa chocolate covered macadamia nuts. Wow I REALLY LOVE this place now. Even I get a treat. \n\nSo the Doc comes in and he does a full exam, askes how he has been, and administers the vaccinations. Well I brought in all the vitamins and such I am giving my dog and he looked them over and answered all my questions. The two times  have been here the Doc has spent quite a significant amount of time with me. The other three animal hospitals I've have tried seem to come in and leave just as fast. This place seems to truly care and spend that extra time with the pets and the customers. \n\nTo top it all off the next day I receive a phone call and it is Aloha asking how my dog is doing and checking to make sure after all his shots and everything he is doing well. I got a check up call for my dog...I've never even gotten one of those for myself!!! \n\nI highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great animal hospital that truly cares."
1,This is absolutely my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  I love the family/casual atmosphere.  The knowledgeable and friendly staff treat us like family.  \n  The menu is diverse and every dish is great.  Eat here...you'll come back again and again.
0,"If this truck had a theme it would be scallions. I ordered a Phil a Delph I think it was called. Ok flavors but nothing WOW about it. I asked for no scallions but to after a nice wait  I saw a green cheesesteak headed my way. Yes that many scallions. The waffle fries with buffalo sauce and crumbled blue cheese were decent, also loaded with scallions. I felt like a judge on iron chef but I was the loser."
0,"Great sound as soon as you get through the front doors.  The set up is pretty neat too, general admission standing, with different level floor, so there is good visibility every where.  And if you can manage to get up front you are literally in arms distance from the performers it's sweet! \n\nThe bartenders were super friendly.  I brought in a reusable cup for water and the bartender was nice enough to keep it full of ice and H2O for free all night!  However, if you looking for adult beverages than you better bring a fat wallet with you because prices are out of control!  \n\nAnd although the bartender couldn't have been sweeter and the door security guys were polite and patience, the security dudes inside were NOT friendly which is the reason for the low rating. I understand that they are there to keep the crowd contained for safety reasons but they are a bit over zealous... I mean to constantly harass anyone that accidentally steps over the line that defines the area you can stand in front of the stage when it's a pack show and every one's dancing or reprimanding anyone even leaning on the railing during set break of a 3 hour show is a bit extreme.  I'm all for safety first but they were just a buzz kill.  With ticket prices are high as they are you would hope that your experience would be customer friendly.\n\nHowever, despite to rude security gang I will surely dish out the dough and find myself shaking it down here in the near future because lets face it, they get great bands and I'm a slave to the music."
1,"The salt and pepper shrimp was fantastic. I didn't have the opportunity to try the calamari but if its anything like the shrimp, it's probably just as fantastic. My husband had the chicken chow fun with black bean sauce and that was ok. He said he would not order it again because it lacked the smoky flavor that other Chinese restaurants have in their chow fun. The Chinese broccoli was a little aged so some of it was stringy and towards the end there were a few pieces that were gritty.  I would definitely come back here for the salt and pepper anything."
1,"This place was excellent. I brought my elderly grandparents, who aren't big on greek, and they had a great time. The sergice was attentive, and thought was put into every dish. \n\nMost Greek/Mediterranean places tend to overflavor their food, I thought Eden balanced the flavor of their chicken brilliantly with just a compliment of nice spices. Their salads were fresh, and the falafel was cispy outside and fluffy inside. I would absolutely go back...and congratulations to the owner on opening a nice, quaint business."
0,"Yes, I ate here only because I wanted to watch the flamingos outside the window.  The food was NOT GOOD.  One of the worst buffets ever.  Not even that cheap, actually overpriced for what it is.  Food was luke warm, not very many choices, and just tasted bad (I went for lunch).  The buffet at Orleans is cheaper, larger, and SIGNIFICANTLY better."
0,More than likely I won't be back.
1,"Went here last night with my husband and had a lot of fun.  I wasn't sure what to expect so I was very surprised when there were actors telling me I was part of the mob and I needed to do some business for them.  I was cracking up the entire time, so my poor husband had to talk to them (and then have them yell at him- \""i wasn't talking to you, i was talking to her!\"").  Lots of fun technology in use as well.\n\nLike the other reviews have said, there is a lot of reading when you finally get to the museum area, which would be a great way to kill an afternoon if you have time for it.  Some really interesting artifacts to look at and a movie to watch if you have the time.  Towards the end, there seemed to be a few places that looked like they could have used a little more work.\n\nOverall, if you are the museum type or have an interest in the mafia I think you would enjoy this.  If you're not, than you may want to think twice before you go.  Def make time to spend an hour and a half to be there, longer if you want to read everything or watch the film.  The price is a bit high, but if you can get discounted tickets it's worth it.\n\n5 stars if they fix up the end of the exhibit and lower the price."
1,"So good! So adorable! I want to give it 5 stars and there is only one reason I'm not going to. The service.\n\nThe service was strangely slow. It kept seeming like our server was forgetting about us. Even when he'd come over he seemed pretty distracted. The woman who was refilling the waters also seemed pretty distracted. At one point she dumped so much ice in my husbands cup that it was a little ice mountain sticking out of it. And then she overfilled my cup with water which started spilling on me but she never noticed. They also never even asked if we wanted a second glass of wine or beer. I probably would have gone for it seeing as we had to wait for the food for so so long.\n\nThe food though, the food was so worth the wait!!! First of all the appetizer we had, mozzarella and basil was amazing. The basil was really fresh. There seemed to be two types of mozzarella, and the really creamy one on top of the appetizer was to die for. The pesto drizzled across the plate I could drink.\n\nThey have a really nice option where you can choose 2 out of 3 things, half sandwich, cup of soup and half salad. All for $9.75. I went for the half vegetarian sandwich and half Italian picnic salad. I loved both. The vegetarian sandwich was unlike any vegetarian sandwich I'd had before. Sure I've had the things on it before, but I'm thinking not together, and maybe not stuff of such high quality. The salad had these delicious cheeses in it along with bacon. What's not to love?\n\nWe sat outside on the patio and it was so nice. Really pretty furniture and accents and I loved the outdoor/indoor bar.\n\nSo, weird service, if the food had sucked I would have been annoyed, but since it didn't I'll just hope that's not normal because I'm going back for sure."
0,Apparently you cannot order the traveler through the drive-through even though it does not state that anywhere on the menu and if you go inside to order the traveler the clerks get upset and sigh as though your an inconvenience to them.  No customer service.
1,"Great place to watch the games. Comfy seating. Wall of TVs. Food and drink specials during all NCAA and NFL games. $5 appetizers: Great wings, nachos, mac n cheese bites, and zucchini. Still more items to try next time. Giveaways during MNF."
0,"Clean place , service is okay just the food comes out to slow and sometimes chefs take off early so you can't get certain dishes on the menu !! Was kind of disappointed"
1,"I'm always a sucker for local video game stores.\nI've lived in places dominated by GameStop and EB Games... and I used to love frequenting them... when they were smaller and far less corporate. Over the years though, those individual stores started losing their spirit, their individual management that made them feel like local stores of their own. Now they're just filled with half-meant smiles and trained-speeches. It's hard to get a real, honest, individual opinion out of the workers of these places without knowing they've been a bit brainwashed with what they know.\nWhich is why I started avoiding them and started aiming for local video game stores.\n\nI came to visit my partner in Arizona and wondered, \""Hmm... she goes to GameStop a lot... but is there a store near her that's local AND worth going to?\""\nLo and behold, I find this place.\nIt's certainly awesome. \n\nNow, I've seen larger selections elsewhere, I've seen better store conditions and organization elsewhere, I've seen better forms of self-advertisings and community-building strategies in other areas...\nBut if you want the best in AZ when it comes to local video game stores - as in a place that JUST focuses on video games and knows their stuff (both old school and new school): You're going to want to come here.\nA perk? They'll match GameStops' prices, if not beat them entirely.\n\nOutside of that... what I CAN say I'm very surprised by and applaud them for: They have the largest selection of darn-good used games I've seen in any local video game store. It's not often when you'll see extremely-popular old games or even underground-hit niche titles still in stock in a place that isn't eBay. But there's actually a good chance you'll find it here! Other local game stores I've been to? These things are often SOLD OUT immediately.\nBut here, you might find that they own TWO copies, if not more, of what you didn't know you were looking for.\n\nIn Arizona? Want a video game store that feels like it's actually run by a video game enthusiast that doesn't just spout advertisements? Look no further, step on in."
0,There is something wrong when you try and use a shared branching system and you are told that you are second rate and will have to wait for all the other customers who are members to be helped before you will be helped
0,"Friendly staff but everything else is just bad, ( accept the salsa that comes with the chips... Which you do pay for ) first of all it's called tacos and beer but when you go in it doesn't feel like a place to relax and drink a beer it's more like a stuffy date restaurant with low lighting, they are really over priced for the portions they give and their food is nothing special. It's really uncomfortable if you have kids and the tables are over crowded with stuff. Would never eat there again and I love mexican food."
1,"Gute Lage, nettes Personal. Preise sind i.O. und die Zimmer auch. Das Essen in der Hausbar ist gut und preiswert. Kann dieses Hostel nur empfehlen."
0,"I've stayed here several times over several years. The decor is nice, the setting is serene, and the beds are comfortable. But, I can't imagine staying here except through name your own price bids on Priceline. I would bid a lower star level on Priceline, except for fear of getting some unlikely but dreadful outcome. Bidding for Scottsdale Conference Center, more Conference Center than Resort, is risk management. Sadly, I've never gotten a (different) resort in Scottsdale to take my bid. Many complain about the resort fee and the location of the self-parking. I don't love these either, but I think they're immaterial. (More thoughts on the resort fee at the end.)\n\nI have not raised any of the following concerns before this review, because it seems futile. I have never used the pool. Why would I? It and the surroundings are forgettable compared to many relatively pedestrian hotels in the metro area and elsewhere. Also, the chemicals in the hot tub were so strong that they bleached my trunks. The chairs in the room are uncomfortable (and I don't think they are antiques, which might be worth having even if not comfortable). There are some really simple fails that I can't believe the hotel doesn't fix, and the lack of effective response seems to speak to the hotel's lack of concern for guest satisfaction...1. If you can actually get it brewed, the in-room coffee is vile--yes, vile. Remember to bring your own coffee with you, if you like having decent coffee before going out in the morning. 2. The coffee pots are dysfunctional--they get stuck regularly and don't complete brewing; the carafe is practically impossible to remove from the apparatus, which gets messy. 3. Why do the sinks still not have hot water reliably!? When the dust settles, I am still very satisfied at the name your own price rates I have obtained, but I would be irate if I paid what the hotel asks publicly.\n\nAs an aside, the hot water at the sink still doesn't work several months after the other review complaining about this issue, and I've stayed in several different rooms at the property. In light of this, the management's repeated cheeky form response (to that reviewer and to other yelpers on different issues) to the effect of \""hope you aired your concerns so they could be addressed while you were there\"" seems hollow and phony. Frankly, I didn't need a smoking gun to divine that--it is apparent from the tone of the replies. I don't know why the hotel bothers to respond to these reviews if it's not going to do so effectively; it just makes things worse. I actually felt much better about staying here before I read the management's responses! I would prefer negligence and neglect over calculated disdain. I may share my views with the management via email or in person--hopefully it will go to someone other than the person who apparently monitors yelp.\n\nHere is my longwinded take on the \""resort fee\"" (a common theme on this page). It  strikes me as essentially cosmetic for an informed consumer, given that practically all resorts in the local market are charging a similar fee (it's more of an issue when non-resort (in Priceline parlance) hotels charge a \""resort fee\""). But that doesn't make it ok. If the fee is per rooms, it should be built into the price. Otherwise, it is annoying. I can only think of two reasons to break it out separately, neither of which inspires confidence from the consumer's point of view. The most likely is that the hotel wants to trick someone who isn't likely to be a repeat customer. The other is to send a signal along the lines of \""we're special, and you're paying more because you're getting more.\"" (A resort fee is a star on a Sneetch's belly.) This, however, makes absolutely no sense, because resort amenities vary dramatically just like any other hotel amenities, and travelers generally make decisions about how much to pay for hotel-apples and hotel-oranges based on a holistic assessments. Resort amenities are no different from views, location, furnishings, staff, etc. It is obvious that most people don't read disclosures--the goal of most people who write them is to have plausible deniability but not to help the reader. A per person resort fee might make some sense, but that's not how they charge."
0,"Not shave ice but not ice cream!? Say whaaaaat?!\nI have heard great things about Kuma Snow Cream recently and finally decided to try it out with some friends!\n\nFirst of all, let's start with the ambiance--I have to say, it is beyond adorable in there! I am a sucker for modern and white furniture. How cute is that thing! (Is that a bear? I don't know.) It really is adorable! I was there around 8 pm and it wasn't busy at all. Oh, and the service is great, too! As a first timer, they were patient with me and gladly got me through the process of choosing the base, toppings, and sauce!\n\nNow, for the actual product... I have to be honest. I was thoroughly disappointed with this. I had the mango snow cream with peaches, mangoes, and condensed milk. Pretty basic! Can't really screw it up, and nothing too exotic for the first try. Right? Sigh. It just wasn't good. The texture was interesting (in a good way) but the snow cream itself didn't taste like anything. I didn't taste \""mango\"", and mango was what I had expected... I'm not even sure I tasted any condensed milk. I found myself just eating the fruit while I kind of just let the snow cream plop in its container. Yes. \""Plop\"".\n\nAnyway, I really am sad this wasn't what I thought it'd be. Did I just get the wrong flavor? Was it just an \""off\"" day for mango snow cream? I don't know. Nevertheless, I think I'm willing to give it another try sometime!"
1,Ordered 6 medium wings and a medium Chicago style.  \n\nWings were surprisingly good and the ranch was so good I wanted to drink it.  Yum!  \n\nPizza was good too.\n\nEmployees leave something to be desired and the girls at the counter are not very bright.  \n\nWould order again.
1,"This my favorite pub in Phoenix! Good beer selections. Good food (the shepard's pie is amaze-balls, the Irish nachos are epic, and the frickles are delish). They have good live music / entertainment during the evenings. This is a great place to go during the day to hang out with friends, watch a game, have a quiet beer, or have an awesome night out partying. The weekend nights are a raging blast! The staff does a great job handling it all!"
1,I just bought my first fountain pen. So what do I do within a month of owning it?  I bend the nib!!

I was able to repair the pen with him on the phone!!!\n\nI will definitely be back for any supplies or advice I need int he future!!\n\nThanks Jay!!
1,"Their calzones, salads, and pizza muffins are great!!! There pastas are okay, nothing special but still good. The atmosphere is very quaint and intimate. Perfect banquet room for a party or shower (I have been to both there) and the pricing is very good. The staff is always friendly as well. I have been going here for about 7 years and I will continue to go!"
1,"Sushi is ok, not the best, but decent given the prices. We came in on a Saturday during lunch and it was not crowded at all. Great place if you want to satisfy your sushi craving fast. The nigiri was pretty good and overall the sushi was very fresh. Lots of selection too."
1,"I have always been a fan of the Mellow Mushroom concept.  I think this place has a great theme and atmosphere.  \nVery laid back hippie, stoner vibe.\nMy daughter absolutely loved the bus and the fact we could dine inside of it\nPerfect, good atmosphere and entertaining my 3 year old.  \nWe started with the Brushetta app.  This Brushetta is perfect for me.  It is served with feta and a balsamic glaze.  I will go back for this alone.\nI am from NY and love my pizza so with that being said their pizza is a little different than the tradition NY style I am use to.  They have a sweeter crust and it is a bit thicker than my liking.  We did get the house pizza which came with a generous amount of toppings.  The pizza was good but it is not the best I have ever had.  \nThe beer selection was huge which was great, I ordered 2 of the \""dirty hippy\"" beers they had on the menu.  This was actually really good, it was Sweet Water 420 layered with Guinness VERY TASTY! \n\nI will be definitely be back and recommend everyone to try it out if they have never been to a Mellow Mushroom."
1,"One of my top favorite Filipino Restaurants in Vegas. Must try the Max's Chicken, Dry Adobo and everything else on their menu! Soon they will be open late nights with drink specials and  meal deals. The atmosphere is nice and the entire staff are much nicer and respectful... You can definitely feel the \""Filipino Hospitality\"" when you dine here!"
0,"The description said...\""cheesy creamed spinach served with warm chips\"".  What I received was \""milky spinach served with room temperature chips\"".  The dip would not even sit on the chip. It ran off. Nothing remained on the chip. The chips were fresh though.  I used to enjoy this restaurant and the atmosphere.  It's not the same.  There was no service with a smile nor was there a thank you please come again. Just my bill and the server disappeared. That's exactly what I'll do...and I won't return."
1,"My wife and I booked a room here over the weekend for her birthday. I called ahead and asked if we could check in early and they were very accommodating. We needed to be in by 11:00AM so we could make it over to the start of her party (bar crawl) where all of our friends were waiting. When we got to the hotel, I was helped by Cedrick, at the front desk. He must have read the notes, but he was super friendly and wished my wife a happy birthday. He then proceeded to upgrade us in every way possible to ensure my wife had a great birthday. He upgraded the room as well as free internet and parking. We did not ask nor expect any of this and he just did it, it was amazing. We got to the room and expected a standard room, and entered into more of an apartment style room on the 30th floor with a view, it had two rooms and two bathrooms. Needless to say it was incredible and we have Cedrick to thank for it.  As if they had not already done enough, the next morning we woke up to a note under the door offering us breakfast and drinks on them for my wife's birthday. We didn't end up seeing the note until after breakfast because the bar crawl got the best of us the night before lol. We went down and let them know we did not see the breakfast slips until it was too late, they insisted it was not a problem we have lunch on them and a couple of drinks. The food and service were amazing. I know I will not be staying anywhere else downtown besides the Sheraton. Thank you Cedrick, and everyone else we encountered. You guys helped make my wife's birthday amazing. I can't thank you enough."
0,"I called early this morning to get an appointment today for my dog to be washed & groomed. I got him there a little early and went over the paperwork with \""Tiff.\"" I specifically asked her, and was charged for, the medicated shampoo because my dog has allergies. More on that later. She told me that he'd be ready before 5. \n\nI called at 4:40 and she said he was not done & that she would call me a little after 5. Well, we had another errand so we thought we'd just go do that & then go pick him up without waiting for her call. When we got there at 5, he still hadn't even been started yet!!! Why would they make an appointment for me at 12:30 knowing that they were overbooked and slammin' busy????? So we waited. \n\nWhen he came out he tail was still not cut short enough and there were numerous places that had fur sticking out that should have been cut. His eyebrows are totally uneven and now I have to trim him myself. \n\nAND NOW FOR THE WORST PART.... He came out smelling of some horrible, nauseating spray!!! I specifically told her that he had allergies & that's why I requested the allergy shampoo. Doesn't anybody listen??? My poor dog has been rubbing his face on the carpet all night and now needs another bath. I will never use this place again. 5 hours is way too long for a shampoo & groom!!! Thanks for nothing \""Tiff!!\"""
1,"I had the beef taco and cheese enchilada combo with beans and rice. The beans and rice were pretty standard. The cheese enchilada was quite cheesy and tasty. The beef taco was just OK, but that's partly my fault. I was expecting ground beef, but you have to specifically ask for it, so the next time I will go in I'll try that."
1,"Upon our return, in which we were comped a gift card, the service was excellent, the food even better! I have even received an apology from the waiter. This is my favorite place to eat by far! The oysters are delicious, the Bloody Mary will knock your socks off, the fish is delicious and even something as simple as the cole slaw made with wasabi is absolutely decadent!  I will be back many , many more times!"

0,"Ugh gross.  My family and I visited Treasure Island for the first time and were searching for a good restaurant that was somewhat affordable.    We checked the menu here and decided to try it.  Bad mistake.  The waitress was rude and hardly bothered to come over to our table (8 of us and we all were thirsty)  When we finally got the food, eh, for the most part it was OK but wayyyy too pricey for what it was.  My stepdad ordered the steak sandwich and it was so tough when he bit into it, he had to pull on it and the bread came off.  ...not how a steak should be cooked!  He did not end up eating it and let the waitress know what happened.  The so-called \""manager with a mohawk\"" came over and said he will let the cook know.\nWhat????  Finally, at the end, it was taken off the darn bill and they gave him a big bowl of ice cream since it was his birthday, but that still doesn't make up for being rude and disgusting."
1,"I think what I liked most about this In-N-Out location was the party in the parking lot. \n\nA constant stream of taxis disgorge all elements of the Vegas experience, pre-, during-, and post-party.  Here we are at 7pm getting a snack before our night begins, and these lovely sparkly hoochies are closing down their 36-hour night with some food before they sleep the sleep of the damned.\n\nIt's all good."

We call and ask if we will have somewhere to microwave our food and can if we get folks and spoons, then I was being transferred from front desk to room service to dinning service, by the end we have been told that we need to pay for the folks and spoons! Last but not least, everything in the room is charged for money, no free water nothing is free expect the wifi, oh wait!

0,"A Restaurant.com gift certificate and some curiosity brought my boyfriend and I to Cravin' Cajun last week Wednesday for my birthday dinner. I had done some research reading reviews on Yelp and figured \""What the hell!\""\n\nIt was more like \""What the hell?!\""\n\nI would have to disagree with some of the other reviews here on Yelp. Hot n Juicy is far superior in quality and taste. We typically order crawfish, clams and king crab when we go to Hot n Juicy. It was a bummer that Cravin' Cajun didn't have any clams on that particular night. Next, they only have 2 flavors: Lemon Pepper and their Cravin' Cajun house sauce. I didn't get the punch in the tastebuds effect here as I do at Hot n Juicy. The spiciness is pretty wicked. Can't complain there.\n\nThe service was very good. We were seated promptly (it was pretty empty with about only 6-7 tables being served), didn't wait too long for our food to come and our water cups were constantly filled. Sad to say, the great service wasn't enough to compensate for the mediocre food. I'm just glad I had a $25 gift certificate.\n\nI would not recommend Cravin' Cajun to any of my friends because I love them."
1,"People who don't allow themselves to be immersed in the experience that is Vesper are missing out tremendously.  Granted they make all of the standards very well, but to fully appreciate it you'll want to inform your bartender what type of spirits & flavors you are in the mood for and you'll be conjured up something extraordinary, something to remember for quite some time.\n\nAll of my drinks had tequila in them (my spirit of choice) and I like heat, so habanero was used liberally and the muddled cucumber had a cooling finish.  The wife hates tequila, the bartender said that she wouldn't taste it or she'd get another drink no problem or cost... there was no replacement drink and for the first time in a decade the wife drank tequila.  If a bartender can make a drink with tequila for a tequila-hater and 2 of them are ordered, you know the place has to be ballz."
1,"Like Vegas itself, this Urban Outfitters is fast and easy! It's small not what you're used to. It's one story and you can actually see the whole store, front to back, when you walk in. Does this mean they don't have every over price t-shirt a fly over state tourist would want to bring back to their nephew as a gift? Does this mean that they don't have a decent selection of toys that only a middle age dude that hasn't grown up yet would like? Does this mean they don't have a sale section that has the one item you really need for $9.99, just because it's $9.99."
1,Love the Rhythm Room! I saw Grand Archives there this week and it is the perfect little venue to see any band. Any seat is a good one. The bar is big so you never have to wait to long to get a cocktail. \n\nThe only thing I would like is that you could take your drinks out to the patio. With the admission of the 18+ crowd they have to confine the booze to one side and it's not the smoking side. I guess only once vice at a time.
0,"I wanted to love Windsor because we love Postino. But, there's a different vibe even though it's right across the street.  Service is more flippant and dismissive, the seating options are either too sunny (and hot) outside or too dark (and freezing) inside.  blueberry lemonade is a great concept, but strain the blueberry skins out....nothing like a straw-full to keep you from enjoying your drink. loaded chip app with caramelized onions, bacon and blue cheese could have been amazing, if chips weren't greasy and overdone. the pastrami reuben was good (wet, but good) but not anything out of the ordinary.  chicken salad sandwich was a unique mix of chicken, avocado, nuts and sundried tomatoes but it just seemed like it was trying to hard.\n\nodd service...went from friendly waitress to unfriendly waitress to other food and drink deliverers who had no idea who ordered what."
1,"Stopped in for the first time with the family in tow.  As we walked in we were promptly greeted.  I placed our order which consisted of 5 cheese burgers, 2 French fries with special sauce, 3 Mexican Cokes, & 4 chocolate shakes.  Our bill was approximately $61.  Our order was delivered to our table and everyone was impressed. The food was excellent!  As we walked out my daughters asked when we could return.  Can't wait to return & try the short rib tacos."
0,I was not impressed with this place at all. The chicken I found to be very greasy and was overcooked. The waffles lacked luster in taste....they were straight bland. The place was packed when I went on a Saturday morning and there was no order anywhere in the restaurant. It took over 30 minutes to get the check after we had finished eating. Then to pay there was a line a mile long at the register and one register was not working properly. Was a late morning mistake to come and try this place out. I would avoid eating here the chicken lacks flavor.
0,"Don't go to this store!  The service is always poor: the people working there are unfriendly, don't know what they are selling, where anything is located, and to top it off you are likely to be overcharged.  So if you do go you best check your receipt.  Plus they tend to get in your face when questioned about store policy.  Sure they have the food I want but I can get it in a different \""friendly\"" store.  Lose the attitude!  What ever happened to good quality customer service?"
0,"Can 14 years make a difference in the life of a restaurant?  At Cabo Fish Taco the answer is a resounding NO!\n\nThe last time before this week that I had a meal there was 2000.  At the end of my meal I remarked that the fish was overcooked, tasteless and served barely above room temperature.  The service was at best mediocre.\n\nAs we were in the area, a friend suggested we go there for lunch.  I hesitated for a moment, but then figured they had to get better after 14 years.  WRONG!  Someone please tell me how/why this place is still in business!\n\nWhatever that corn stuff they bring to the table is was horrible.  None of the condiments at the table could make it much better.\n\nOur waitress (in training) was pleasant enough.  She recommended a daily special - Curried Fish (trout I believe) Taco.  I had actually been in the mood for Indian food that day, so a Curried Fish Taco sounded like just the thing.  WRONG!  The curry flavor was so diluted that it tasted as though someone sprinkled just a dash of cheap curry powder on the fish while cooking.\n\nJenny's Cabo's Signature Taco (beer battered white fish) was dry, overcooked, and EXTRA crunchy.  I surely would not want my signature on that!\n\nPerhaps I will wait another 14 years to see if they are able to earn that third star...."

You'll get honest service at a great price and, most likely, will make a few new friends.\nThe crew here has worked on my '72 3.0 CS for several years now.  First, it was to finish the restoration I'd contracted with another shop then to change out my carburetor jets so the car would pass emissions.  With an old car, no matter its degree of restoration, there is always work to do and TTB has since worked on my air conditioning unit, suspension and drive train.  I wouldn't trust my car anywhere else.  If you have a classic this is the best shop in town.  But if you're looking for a shop for your daily driver, give them a chance too.  An honest repair shop.  What a concept!"
0,"Went to dinner tonight and it was different  from every other experience I have ever had at Pig & Pickle. This was just upsetting. The server didn't have much time for our table and actually let us know that. The food was good as usual, but the service ruined my night. I'm disappointed. Worst birthday dinner ever."
0,"I WOULD RECORD EVERYTHING THE FRONT DESK TELLS U. Apparently none of the employees honor anything they say. At check in, the girl had told us there was no resort fee which was strange to me since I had looked on Ballys website and was ready to pay the mandatory resort fee. I made sure to ask her a couple times but trusted the girl and figured it might be a new year and things might've changed.I refrained from using the internet, the fitness center, and the phone, which is included in the resort fee. A day after checkout, we were charged the resort fee on our credit card.I was appalled since I didn't even use any of their services included in the resort fee and got an overdraft on my card which was why I wanted to use cash. I was hung up on 2 times rudely by the front desk when I called about it, when I was able to reach the supervisor, she was equally as rude and said the employee that helped me was very thorough so pretty much calling me a liar. Not to mention half of the lights were out in our room, there were questionable looking stains on carpets and walls. I especially felt uncomfortable during the night and saw shadow like figures near the windows in our room. My boyfriend thought I was crazy but after looking up the history of Ballys, it turns out this same building had burned down in 1980 that killed 87 people. I'm not a person to believe in ghosts but still am shaken up by what I saw. they participate in illegal charging give them cash deposit at check in so theycantcharge it without authorization ."
0,Always closing early and never got to try them yet. Today arrived at 7:41 and female employee turned the sign to close and locked front door. I had just turned my car off and was annoyed. Owner needs to know his staff are closing earlier than 8pm posted closing time-cardinal sin in food business
0,This review is for the gas station. \n\nThe fuel pumps SUCK. Good luck holding the nozzle the whole time while your 40gallon tank fills up. Boo.
1,"Presidents Day weekend FAIL on the \""come for lunch, stay for dinner\"" tactic. If we had gotten there 15-20 minutes earlier (1:30-2pm instead of after 2pm), we probably would have just made it. It's just that we waited over 1.5 hours in that ridiculous line, and it seemed to get worse (but great for King Caesar!) from there on out through the rest of the afternoon and evening. It sounds like these lines (for most buffets) are only this bad during peak times and especially over holidays/holiday weekends, so plan accordingly. It's expensive (dinner is $52 and I think I heard lunch is $42 or around there). You can pay an extra $15 for the express line if you don't want to wait like the rest of the lemmings. I noticed, for a good 5-10 minutes, it seemed like the cashiers were standing around and not ringing people up (probably a \""counter-tactic\"" to push it to 3pm and try to get the rest of these people in at the dinner price). Even after paying, we still had to wait 15-20 minutes to get a table. In the end, we probably waited close to 2 hours. Fortunately, we had no plans until at 7:30pm for the Beatles LOVE show...\n\nSo once we finally got into the buffet, I went straight to the seafood line and loaded up on king crab (they had snow crab too I think). There were oysters as well, but they kept on disappearing too fast - apparently the ratio of shuckers to consumers was severely lacking. One of the shucker guys dumped four oysters directly onto my plate after I stood there waiting for a few minutes though. The oysters were super fresh! So much so that my wife, not an oyster-eater, thoroughly enjoyed hers. The king crab legs were OK - some that we got weren't completely defrosted in some parts, so I found myself eating small bits of king crab ice at times. That said, Dungeness is still my favorite.... it's too bad they didn't have any of that cause I would have gone buck wild on it. \n\nMan, I felt like a kid in a candy store... now, the last time we made a quick \""pit stop\"" in Vegas, we checked out Wicked Spoon. I was thoroughly impressed with that. But this is like Wicked Spoon x2, as another reviewer alluded to. It's literally almost twice as big. Amazing.\n\nSo I made it over to the meat station and picked up a nice chunk of brisket and a lamb chop. The lamb chop was pretty bomb. The brisket was okay. My wife got some prime rib, which looked good but by the time I stuffed myself with everything else I didn't get a good look or taste of it. She also got the spicy sausage and boy was it spicy. IMHO, the meat station at Wicked Spoon has the slight edge here. \n\nOther interesting stuff I picked up: \n\nFried chicken & sweet potato fries - I didn't enjoy this as much because I was stuffed from the plates of king crab we destroyed. It was good though, and I thought the fries were pretty awesome (I think they were drizzled or coated in honey!)\n\nSushi - I only had one piece but it was pretty fresh. \n\nShiao long bao - yes, they did have these. And surprisingly they weren't bad - soupy and flavorful as expected.\n\nPho and tonkatsu ramen - the broth was slightly lacking but the option to even offer these was pretty impressive.\n\nI was looking forward to \""chunks of honeycomb\"" that someone spoke of in another review. Disappointingly, I only saw a display of it (not sure if it was a fake display or real too) behind glass. I did get some \""honeycomb honey\"" which was pretty good though.\n\nAs far as dessert, we were pretty impressed but so stuffed full that we could hardly enjoy anything. Creme brulee, flan, mochi, gelato, chocolate covered strawberries...... EXPLODE! We seriously couldn't eat anymore... but then I just had to get a slice of pizza to cap it all off.\n\nIt all became somewhat overwhelming after a while, but I'd say the top things to consider: OYSTERS, crab (of course), lamb chops, spicy sausage, sushi, fried chicken.\n\nOne thing I almost fainted over when I saw it was a large hot table (ala Mongolian BBQ). They were utilizing it to grill in the Mexican section, but I thought to myself \""wouldn't it be crazy if they had Mongolian BBQ?\"" That would take things to another level, IMHO.\n\nToo much to write about... too much thinking. Still digesting. Until next time, maybe. But only on a non-holiday, off-peak hour, and for lunch going on dinner."
0,"For being such a big store, they have a very small entrance.  I've tried to go in here twice and there's always a gaggle of people crammed around the door trying to get in or out.  And I'm always suspicious of bike shops that don't have a bike rack so you can park your ride outside.  They're probably good people.  But this place seems like an expensive corporate time waster.  I'll try a local mom and pop shop next."
1,"The Traverse has quite captured my heart. I've not been there during the year, I'm afraid (not being a permanent resident of Edinburgh, sob) but during festival season the Traverse can be trusted to put on the most impressive array of shows, most of which are amazing. Granted, I'm a 'theatre person' so my opinion is probably a bit biased, but I'm usually very impressed by the offerings at the Traverse. Even if I don't like a show, it's never all bad - there's something good to each show, whether it's the writing, the acting, or the technical aspects. \n\nThe Traverse focuses on new Scottish playwrights, although during the festival many international companies come through as well. It probably hosts the largest concentration of Fringe First winners of all the venues, and each show is on a highly professional level. As for the venue itself, there are two theatres - a bigger, traditional space and a smaller black box theatre, and there's not a bad seat in either house. There's a coffee shop upstairs and a bar downstairs, and one can usually hobnob with the actors in the bar after a given show, which makes theatre that much more accessible. As far as quality goes, the Traverse is hands-down my favorite venue in Edinburgh."
0,"$6500 and They Thrashed Our Stuff\n\nWe were moving from Tempe to Sacramento, and chose Ace due to a good consultation with the sales person.  They weren't the lowest priced bid, but worked hard to be competitive and gain our business.  \n\nOn moving day, the driver saw immediately that the load size had been underestimated and he would need a 2nd truck.  He called it in at 9:30 am.  By the time the truck was filled at 3:30, no one had responded.  He had to go back across town in afternoon traffic to weigh the truck and either unload it or find another truck.  While waiting the extra 2 hours, the new owners showed up demanding to know when we would be out.  Not really a pleasant experience.\n\nAfter coming back with a second truck, that truck's driver accidentally knocked over and shattered our outdoor glass table for 6.  That was just the start.\n\nI met the driver the next day to sign off the paperwork, and he had repacked the truck so everything fit into 1.  So, all our stuff was handled for a 2nd time.\n\nWe ended up having to store the load at their San Jose facility for almost a month due to house closing and remodeling issues.  They wanted to charge $2700 for the month.  I researched a local storage facility and local movers and determined that would cost about $1200.  At the threat of losing business, Ace decided to match that price.  After already paying $5600 for the move they tried to rip me for an extra $1500.\n\nSo, our things were offloaded in San Jose and then reloaded 3 weeks later for delivery.  At this point, they were loaded/unloaded 4 times.\n\nThe first thing off the truck on delivery day was a smashed lamp that cost $800, followed shortly by a bench with a leg broken off, another lamp with a smashed glass shade, some outdoor flower pots that were cracked, a ladder shelf with the bottom shelf broken off, and various other damaged items.   Several boxes were partially crushed. We had multiple plastic tubs full of Christmas stuff that all had packing tape wound around them.  The tape was gone on all but one of the tubs.\n\nWe were also missing 4 boxes but couldn't really prove it because the numbered stickers on the boxes did not correspond with the numbering system on the paperwork, so we could not say exactly which boxes were missing or what was in them.\n\nThe San Jose crew claimed no responsibility at all, saying that it happened during packing in Phoenix.\n\nThe insurance claim process went ok.  I sent a detailed account of what was damaged (along with pictures).  They sent a claims adjuster out. He filed a report and got authorization to repair what was fixable. (Did a good job.)\n\nThey called today with the final settlement offer, and I'll be paid within 2 weeks.\n\nIt pissed me off that they denied some of the broken items because they didn't pack them.  So, it's OK if they drop, play catch with, or sit on your boxes for lunch, but if they didn't pack it they're not responsible for it.\n\nThere are a lot of moving companies out there.  Think very carefully before choosing this one."
1,"Rock climbing was one of those things that I always thought was cool but didn't really intend to try out. But again, Groupon has given me the opportunity to check this place out. In turn, I'm really starting to like this (expensive) sport even if I am awful at it right now.\n\nThe Groupon was good for two people and it gives you access to a beginner's class once a week for 1 month. The classes are offered on Saturdays (that's the one I chose) and another day during the week (sorry, I forgot!). Along with the classes, they also give you one month of unlimited access with gear so you can come in a practice your skills. The one item not included but would be super useful is the hand chalk.  \n\nI'm not going to lie but when you walk in, it smells like stinky feet. But you get over this relatively quickly. The walls are covered in colorful rocks of different sizes. Parts of the ceiling are as well. I've never seen anything like it! It's quite overwhelming at first. You'll see really advanced folks traversing or climbing away, making themselves look oh so graceful. They have tape all over the walls, indicating the path you should take for a certain level. \n\nSecond and third floors are much smaller than the first. These floors are set up for bouldering, whereas the first floor you can actually get into a harness and utilize the ropes for climbing. I've always gone in the early evenings/late nights and the second and third floors are pretty packed. Perhaps it's better to go in the mornings. \n\nI'm still a newbie at this. Learning all of the terms and techniques are boggling my brain! But with Matt the class instructor, I have confidence that I'll get better soon! Matt is super patient and is thorough with his explanations which I am super appreciative of! \n\nDisclaimer to all those that have not done this: You will be sore. No joke. I look like a robot when I walk right now. You will get blisters on your hands. Battle wounds on your legs. But trust me, it's all worth it!"
1,"Had the King crab legs--hard to give it anything but 5 stars, but it was pricey.  It's a great restaurant, but in a town of great restaurants, it's 4 stars."
0,"The quality of the food has really plummeted over the past year. We use to love coming her to get the creamy clam chowder, not its watery and gross. The nachos were awesome, now the cheese looks brown and disgusting. After 7+ years of coming regularly we likely won't be back."
0,"I would like to preface this review by stating that I haven't been to Pepin's in over 11 years, but at one time, it was my go-to place. My most recent experience will undoubtedly make it my last time going there! Upon arrival, we were seated and my credit card was taken, to charge me $60.00 to cover my party of six. I was told we would have to order an \""entree\"" to get the $60.00 refunded to us. As we had eaten earlier, we decided to get four \""hot\"" appetizers, several drinks and a pitcher of sangria. In addition, four persons ordered drinks, totaling $50.00, from the bar. We were sat at a table for four and our appetizers arrived, cold, overpriced and without adequate room to sit and enjoy. Imagine my disappointment, when I received MY tab, $67.00 and was told that I would not be getting my \""cover\"" charge refunded, however, we spent, with tip, $132.00, for 10 cold shrimp, cold calamari and a couple of beers and drinks and a pitcher of sour sangria! All in all, $200.00 and we were seated where we were unable to see the dance floor, so no entertainment, either! I was VERY disappointed and to add insult to injury, we were offered  ONE glass of soured sangria, as a consolation!"
0,"This place was a huge disappointment. After hearing how it had been recognized on the Food Network, I went there with a friend on a Sunday evening and found the food to be mediocre and overpriced. The waiter also tried desperately to get us to purchase wine and sides. I finally relented to an order of garlic bread, and was served plain, stale bread. For this stale bread, we got charged $3. I will not be going back. If you want Italian, Red Devil is a better deal with a nicer atmosphere and better wait staff.. Oh yeah, the bread is good and complimentary."
0,"If you want to have the worst pool experience ever then this is the pool for you!  We went on Saturday around 11 am, and the water was already murky and gross looking.  Plus its super small, and I am sick of snobs who think they are too cool. Plus to top it all off the bartender mixed up our credit card with the only other person at the bar who just happened to have the same looking card!  We were left without a debit card for the rest of the trip, and when we tried to get it resolved the people that work her are the most incompetent people we have ever met! Never again!"
0,"I was lucky number.... not!!! I took my chances and went with Hotwire with the booking and to my disappointment, I got the Trump Hotel.  I figured, this can't be that bad... well, it sorta is.\n\nTrump Hotel:\n-Away from the strip, believe me it's a long walk to the general area\n-Resort fee ($25/night) for all the necessary inclusions like wifi, free shuttle to Wynn and Caesars, shoe shine (only for BLACK shoes! no cognac or brown),\n-No casino here\n-Restaurant below is disappointing\n-Stuck us in the handicap room... who does that?!\n-No housekeeping for 2 nights?! C'mon, get your act together\n\nAll in all, it's was a pretty bad experience for me and I would consider spending your dime elsewhere.  Extra thumbs down for no housekeeping. =(\n\nMeh..."
1,"The food was awesome and getting everything comped was even better.  WOOHOO!\n\nVoga is the Flamingo's new restaurant.  They've been updating the casino to be more with the times and Voga is a nice new addition.  A hip little bistro where the old Italian restaurant used to be.\n\nThe bruschetta tower, lettuce wraps, and lobster tail were awesome but the best was the dessert.  Fried doughnuts and fried Twinkies with chocolate and marshmallow sauces and a creme brulee trio!  OMG!  The fried Twinkies are like a deep fried menage au trois after going thru a 3 year sexual drought in the mouth.\n\nIt's a total recommend!\n\np.s. -  It's pretty pricey so I recommend you get your Harrah's points racked up to get the meal comped!"
0,"this was awful, will not go here again.  It was expensive, and, you could not tell\nwhat you were getting.  The soups were awful, and, the meals were over $15 and up, it was not worth it.  The ice cream desserts were melted and more like Ice cream soup, the coffee drinks were over $4.00.  Will never go back here again."
0,"Honestly we ate here last weekend because we were staying at Excalibur and it was the least busy restaurant. I kind of like the whole rocker vibe to it, but there is nothing noteworthy about the place. The novelty of the name/band affiliation does not make a restaurant.  The food was typical bbq that I could get anywhere, served cafeteria style..yawn. and as for the prices, give me a break! Even for Vegas it was overpriced and underwhelming. I had 1/2 a chicken, 2 sides and my partner had a pork chop and 2 sides which came to over $40!! I know its on the Strip but its not like this is a fancy restaurant.. \n\nAs for seeing any actual members of the band, not sure if they actually stop by but I did see Vinnie Paul the drummer for Pantera there.  That is about as rock n' roll as it gets."
0,"WORST resturant i went on my whole trip!!!!!!!!! Poor customer service, after having an appetizer my roll never came and I had to tell my waitress who told me I should have reminded her my roll never came...the roll it looked all dried out and dull, and it had this really awful smell. Kind of like when you use way too much detergent in washing your tupperware, put your food in the tupperware, and then your food ends up smelling like a mix of plastic tupperware and detergent. The waitress was a hostile listener. She never came to check on us. Every time we asked her for something she totally looked frustrated.\n\nThis place is a pass. I will never, never return."

0,"My niece had her wedding at our home and catered by Southern Gourmet...so I will submit my review based on a two categories:  food and service.\n\nThe food was very good.  We had pork Marsala and Tuscan chicken for entrees.  Both were quite delicious and overall, the food was tasty and cooked well.\n\nThe service, on the other hand, was sorely lacking.  I realize that a caterer is there to do a job, but the abrupt attitude and overall rush to get plates off the table had me hovering over my dinner because I was afraid someone would take my plate if I didn't guard it!  I (we) were really put off by the (dare I say bitchiness?) sorry attitude.  It was supposed to be a fun event, not a race to get food served and removed!  And, in fact, we set up all the tables, not the caterer as arranged, so you would think they would have been appreciative that they didn't have to take the time to do it.  \n\nOverall, I think I would probably look elsewhere for a future event.  I don't need attitude in my home from someone I'm paying for \""service\""."
1,"Cooperstown Sports Grill Does NOT disappoint! \n\nCooperstown offers an incredible selection of beers, good food and excellent service.  The prices are reasonable, and the servers are outstanding.  \n\nCooperstown Sports Grill is big, filled with large screens televisions. The walls are covered in vintage guitars signed by every rock star and rare sports collectibles signed by past & present icons.\n\n The food entrees have celebrity names, like the Bill O'reilly BBQ sandwiches, Kurt Warner corned beef,  AZ Cardinals Country BBQ chicken salad, or my favorite the \""Jeff\""  grilled chicken salad.  I would put the grilled chicken salad up against anybody (including Durant's or even Arrogant Butcher).\n\nSo if you find yourself in downtown Phoenix give Cooperstown Sports Grill a try, it does not disappoint"
0,Simple review:  the food and service are good if you don't mind smelling like an ashtray after.  I can't go for lunch because I can't stand smelling like that all day.  \n\nI can't believe this place gets by with allowing smoking considering how much food they seem to serve.
0,"How could anyone of Japanese lineage give this place more than 3 stars?\n\nThis place is completely marketed and designed for Westerners. When you walk inside all you see are: White folks, Hawaiians, and a random Korean guy sitting in back.  There were absolutely  no one of Japanese descent eating here.\n\nBefore I write my review, let me tell you a personal story about my Dad. Everyone from Hawaii will tell you stories about that one Japanese family who lived on their street who absolutely refused to assimilate to Hawaiian culture. They didn't speak in that \""Wakki Lakki talk\"", hated saying Aloha, refused to call their brothers: \""brah-duh\"", and thought surfing was the sport of idiots. These Japanese men raised their kids in a traditional Japanese style. And, that was how my Dad was raised. So, he knows good Japanese food when he sees it. My Dad came to Miko's about 2 years ago and hated it so much that he called me and told me never to come here. I didn't believe him back then because my Dad literally hates everything for no reason. He even hated Urusawa(the most famous sushi bar in LA), and got into a fight with the chef. So, when I walked in Miko's today, I had totally forgotten everything he had told me about this place. For the first time in my life, I actually agree with my Dad on something. This place wasn't a Japanese restaurant.  \n\nWhen I first walked in, I stood at the front desk for about 5 minutes before anyone even said \""hi\"" to me. The man working here(who looked like he was half white and half Hawaiian-Japanese) was too busy kissing the asses of the regular customers to even bother seating me. The regular customers here get all the priority. Even if they order 15 minutes after you order, they will get their food before you do. \n\nWhen I was finally sat, it took him another 5 minutes to come back over and take my order. And after he dropped my bowl of Ramen off, he never came back over again. This whole time I was here, he was acting lazy and having fun with all his regular customers.\n\nSome places use a Tonkotsu base for their Miso Ramen, while  most places use a chicken bone base. Miko's Izakaya uses water mixed with a powder. \n\nThe 2 slices of Narutomaki were nothing more than generic prepackaged \""swirl\"" fish cakes you buy at Greenland Market. It's a product of South Korea.\n\nThe hanjuku egg was nothing more than just a hard boiled egg with no soy sauce. And the egg was VERY hard boiled. \n\nThe Charsiu tasted like it was made days in advance. It didn't even taste like pork. It tasted like an oven roasted piece of dried out turkey. \n\nThe Miso Ramen's broth tasted 100% identical to Nissan Ramen's Instant Miso Flavor, which you can buy at both Greenland Market and Japan Creek.\n\nIf you want good Ramen in Las Vegas, go to places like Ramen Sora, Shuseki, Yagyu Yakinku. Anime Ramen has not been the same since Ryosuke went back to Japan, but it's still far superior to the instant cup of noodles you get at Miko's. \n\nThis was a 1-star experience. The food was 1-star, and the service was 1-star. The only reason I am giving this place another star is because when I was leaving, the Sushi Chef(a true full-blooded Japanese man) tried to get my attention.  He then gave me a certain unique look which I remembered from my youth with my Dad. While I was eating, I did notice the look of concern that the traditional Japanese Chef had on his face when he noticed I was being ignored. Traditional Japanese men do not have to use words to express their feelings of regret. When I was walking out the door, he let me know with facial expressions and body language that he felt it was wrong that I was treated so badly. I thought it was a kind gesture."
1,"We loved this place since they were located next to the Smith's on Flamingo, small intimate, but then they expanded to their location on Spring Mountain, it was big and very nicely decorated but they closed up even though it always appeared to be busy, we thought they were gone for good, but then we discovered their newest location at Village square and are enjoying once again great food and service. \n\nI love the happy hour, who doesnt love margaritta's! They serve roasted onions and jalapena with radish, soup with the meal and they gave us complmentary desert. \n\nI chose the combination plate, chili relleno, beef taco and chili verde enchilada. It was very good. My husband got a steak it was grilled and very tender! It was a good meal. Always good food great service and good margaritta's!"

0,"Down we go as I tried the turkey. Ya know those Jenno O turkey breasts you always see in the store? - well it appears Dickey's bought a bunch of them and put them in the smoker and then charged us $5.50 for a large sandwich. The turkey is not good breast meat, it tastes more of gelatin you find in the Jenni O world. BBQ sauces all all watery now, saw some forms of fly hovering near the dirty meat cutting area as well. The pickles are good though and you can stock up on fake plastic silverware on the to-go orders. I will only visit a Dickey's in the south from now on - that chain food just seems to always taste better in BBQ country."
0,"I met a couple of friends here Sunday morning (by that I mean noon - don't judge me) for breakfast. I have been searching high and low for a place to finally catch on to the bacon bloody mary craze, and I heard this was the right spot. I expected a crowd, but there was plenty of parking and plenty of seating available. I became skeptical, and rightfully so. I was not at all impressed by the boring 1985 country-kitchen d\u00e9cor, which included grandma-powder-blue diner booths and a few rogue tables in unfortunate positions. The walls were \""decorated\"" with nothing more than dozens of identical empty ketchup cans and a couple of oddly placed flat screens. The food was disappointing, at best. I'm not sure how they managed to ruin simple potatoes, but I'm fairly sure it was intentional. They were hard round disks that appeared to have been soaked in some kind of onion-oily substance, and tasted nothing short of old. The bacon-bloody was equally as disappointing. It was mediocre in flavor and had relatively no kick = pointless. The only thing bacon-y about it was a skewered piece of chewy bacon climbing out the top - good for display, but perhaps they should consider cooking it first or maybe working the flavor into the drink. In fact, I didn't really see anything bacon-y about this place. It's a shame because there really is a lot of potential here -great location, open and spacious layout, a full bar (which is v. important in any breakfast joint), etc. \n\nI'm giving the stars for the decent, friendly service and the availability to get a table at any time. I typically judge my breakfast experiences by how helpful they are in relieving my hangovers. I was hoping for a fun, lively environment coupled with a little hair-o'-the-dog, in which my friends tell me about the good times I had the night before (because i can't remember). Sadly, Bacon didn't come through for me."
1,"I am very reluctant to pay more than $50 for any show, so when I found cheap last minute tickets to Folies Bergere at tix 4 tonight, it was the perfect deal for me.\n\nThe show is extremely entertaining. It starts out a little slow, but the dance numbers and costumes get better and better and the finale is awesome.  I am pretty critical of dancing and I thought that all of the female dancers were good and most of the male dancers were pretty good.  The male and female gymnasts were amazing.  The main female singer is perfect for her part.\n\nIt seems like most nights, they have a later show that is topless and an early show that is not topless.  The crowd is a little older, but who cares?  If you buy your tickets at the Tropicana, I believe most of them are in the $70 range.  A little high for me, but you can seek out better deals on tickets.\n\nOne last thing...The tables in the theater are a little strange.  I was expecting round tables, but most of the seating consists of long tables that are perpendicular to the stage, so you have to turn your chair and twist your body to face the stage.  If this bothers you, I would pay more for one of the booths, which face the stage and looked very comfortable.\n\nOverall, I was very entertained by this show and would recommend it to others."
1,"Parc Laurier is either my favourite or second favourite park in the city. Big leafy, shady trees in the summer keep this ginger from burning to a crisp, but also a tiny skating area in the Winter to keep me entertained...this park truly has a bit of everything. The swimming pool is lovely (and freaking cold!), the grass areas are plentiful, the public washrooms are decent and close and helloooo, there are ping pong tables, niiiiice. People BBQ, drink wine and act their age here; now that's a great Montreal park!"
0,Beautifully laid out store but the staff is very uptight. The prices are very high and in many cases as high as a new item. To be the only consignment store in Scottsdale to not allow pictures is strange. What are they hiding?
0,"For the most part, this is a pretty standard albertsons - well lit, reasonable prices, fairly well stocked. \n\nSomething must be up with pay or management or the holidays or something, because the employees here seem disgruntled, which really affects the customer experience.\n\nI came in the other day and saw a bag of shredded cheese that had a huge hole in it. I stopped the nearest employee I saw, who was unloading some boxes, and said \""excuse me, I found this bag that has a hole in it.\"" \""oh, it has a hole in it? ok.\"" uh... you're welcome. Next time maybe I won't try to do the nice / right thing and I'll just leave it hanging until someone picks it up without noticing the hole and spills shredded cheese all over the display\n\nToday, upon checkout, apparently the person behind me was an employee coming off shift. She and the cashier struck up a conversation about how annoyed / angry they were about the way they were scheduled. OK, you're unhappy and venting with a colleague.. maybe wait until you aren't around customers or you are off the clock to do it. Incredibly unprofessional\n\nI usually only come to Albertsons if there's something in particular I can't get at some of the smaller / less overwhelming stores. This is why."
1,"These guys were fantastic.  I called, got an estimate and used the yelp voucher which saved me $40 on my service.  We just moved here and needed new keys cut for our mailbox.  They were here exactly on time (wooowwww).  He did his work quick and efficiently and charged me exactly what I was quote over the phone!  Satisfied."
1,"I am a big fan of sushi and have been to many different sushi bars in the tempe area. I was so impressed by sushi time! First big plus - an immaculately clean and rarely crowded establishment. I am always surprised that there are never many people there when I go - maybe I just go at the wrong time, or people don't know about it, because the place rocks.  You order up at the front counter, and then they bring your tray to you when the food is ready - drinks are self serve also. \nTheir sushi is really delicious and fresh! They make one of the best Las Vegas Rolls i've ever had - make sure to try it if you go. Also, every day they have 'combos' posted, where it's $10.99 for two types of rolls (the rolls in each combo are different every day) and miso soup. For the price, delicious sushi, and clean, modern atmosphere, I would definitely recommend this place!"
1,I love I here! It's a big church with a small church feel! Everyone says hello and is helpful! I must say they have the best nursery director ever! But I may be a little bias  ! !
1,I have order about have the menu. This place is very good. The chicken katsu and the misubi is delicious. I did order the orange chicken and the only critique is not to use to much garlic it orange chicken after all not garlic chicken and the garlic does need to be cooked so it doesn't over power the dish. And the lumpia needs to be fried with very hot oil so it doesn't come out to greasy/oily.
1,"I was visiting Vegas this weekend, and stepped into Sunrise this morning before heading home, and just to be clear: this place rocks! Baristas knew their coffee, and we're super friendly, I also loved that they roasted their beans in store. Size of shop was small but still comfortable. I will definitely be returning to this coffee house whenever I find myself in Vegas again. Oh, and my cappuccino was great."
1,"Came here to buy my boyfriend some casual shirts and jeans. The sales representative who approached me, Gene, was very helpful and nice. Helped me pick out some very nice shirts I wouldn't have otherwise picked out myself. Wasn't pushy in trying to get me to buy other things. Boyfriend loved the clothes and they fit well. Will definitely come back next time he needs some new clothes."
0,"Terrible place, do not waste your time!  Awful valets, very slow, most restaurants closed for lunch.  Go somewhere nice like Wynn, Encore, Cosmo, etc.\nWayne Gorsek"
0,"Perhaps a good place for a drink, but the food was positively dreadful even by airport food standards. Split chicken fingers and fries with my son. Food was dry and bland. I found the server to be borderline rude despite the place being empty. Prices were really high although you have to expect that at an airport. Wish I would have walked a little further to a more local establishment."
0,"Decent tasting. Not bad for $5 but tonight when I went,  I ordered breadsticks , similar to crazy bread, but they forgot to include sauce and the bread sticks were undercooked and doughy. My pizza had way too much cheese and was barely cut. The pizza looked like it had just been thrown into the box, getting cheese and sauce all over the inside of the pizza box."
0,"This place was horrendous.  We bought VIP line passes that included two hours of drinks.  Arrived, and there was no line, so we totally did not need that VIP pass.  In order to sit ANYWHERE in this place, you needed to buy a couch, and this was a $375 minimum.  Give me a break.  A bottle of Bacardi is $12 at the store.  The music and DJ were good, but the place was way too crowded (they had not opened the other area even though they advertise how large this place is) and the bathrooms were almost impossible to get to (behind the dance floor).  Bartenders were quick and friendly.  Anyway, I would never go here again."
1,Pretty good dinner with a nice selection of food. Open 24 hours and provide nice service. I usually go here after a night of partying. My favorite dish is the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict.
0,"I was excited to get a pedicure here because of all the options. Too bad the girl at the front desk had a bad attitude.  I sat down for a few minutes after checking in and then had a question.  Even with a second chance she still never every made eye contact or smiled at me. I ended up just leaving. I don't care how good a pedicure is, your customer service should be just as good."
0,"Arrived on a Saturday and there was a dj and gogo dancing by the bar but by Monday just a spot to grab a drink, catch up on sports and play video poker. Service was adequate not much more to say."
0,Ok so here's the thing...the bar is called Rockhouse. We went there after reading reviews all hyped up for beer pong and girls in cages. Nope. Nada. Zip. Empty cages. No pong. Hip hop that was happening maybe 4 years ago. Idk...perhaps its just me? But I felt duped. Nothing that was advertised at all plus no rock music. Humph.
0,"OK, I must stay loyal to Thai BBQ chain because they introduced me to the pleasures of Thai food. BUT I must say, this particular location really let me down. I've been to this location a number of times, and for my first review for them I'm disappointed to report that the staff here really needs to get their stuff together! I found a much better Thai food restaurant and will no longer be going the Thai BBQ, unless I'm extremely desperate for Thai food. WHY? Because on final bon voyage visit to Thai BBQ, I experienced the worst service and delivery. \n\nThe hostess that was there that night was unbelievably rude, for example, we arrived at 9pm and they close at 10pm, so when she greeted us she looked at her watch and rolled her eyes. Not to mention the mean mug we saw when we first walked in. Then to follow, literally two minutes after we sat down, she came up to us and asked us if we were ready to order, she didn't even ask if we wanted something to drink first. As we waited for our meal we glanced over at her and noticed that 1) she never smiled (looked extremely angry) and 2) Was talking on the phone while she sat other guest. This had to have been the worst hostess in the world!! OK so got our meal and felt extremely uncomfortable every time the waitress came by- which wasn't a whole lot and finally time to leave- we decided to be nice and leave a tip of $1 even though we felt she really didn't deserve it. Meal was less than $20. As we walked out to our car we glanced back and noticed the waitress mad-dogging us as we left! NO JOKE! She had the blinds open and was staring us down. Then she followed us outside, stood there, and gave us a look of death! I'M NOT KIDDING. ON TOP OF THAT she came out a second time as we were in the car pulling out, and started pointing and yelling something that we couldn't understand. At that point we were burning rubber out of the parking lot! We understand that leaving a dollar might have been insulting to her, but we figured it was better than nothing given her crappy attitude and poor delivery. Had we known we would be harassed out of the parking lot that night by an ornery waitress we mightve brought some protection. \n\nI don't want to end on a negative note because like I said, I started out with Thai BBQ, as far as meals go I suggest the BEEF SATE (comes with a delicious peanut sauce that is to DIE for, Marinated sliced beef or chicken, in a mixture of Thai spices and coconut milk grilled and served on bamboo skewers with cucumber salad.) I've had the Chicken Sate but it wasn't as good as the beef. I'm huge on curry, and the Yellow chicken curry is good except I'm not a huge fan of simply adding sliced green peppers in the curry to make it spicy. At the very least try a side of their fried rice- DELICIOUS! and so sweet- you'll love it!"
1,"You might think that because this is the first comic haven i've come across, and that I momentarily the name with Doomsday comics, thinking it to be a clever tie in with Utopia, that my opinion of this little den might be skewed.\n\nBoth are true, but folks, my four stars stand strong.\n\nThis place isn't much to look at and in all honesty, walking in the door was a bit of a let down. I'm used to my comic stores bursting at the seams - with rows upon rows, boxes upon boxes to get lost in. At first glance, this place seems a little sparse to truly make it a worthy contender of my rather fickle geek love. But this minimal little room holds some serious oophm.\n\nCase in point: I'm currently obsessed (and will talk your ear off about... just try me) three different series of graphic novels: Y The Last Man, Fables & Promethea. I'm currently smack in the middle of all three - mainly because my previous Canadian comic joints were frequently out of stock in the next editions of all of the above. When I try to buy comics, it seems that without fail I am doomed to find one book off. If i'm on book 10, they'll stock 12. It's a middle class curse i'm none to fond of.\n\nWhich is why this place gets a geeky nod from this gal - not only did I find all three series within record time, but they had every next chapter I was looking for. Which is just wonderfully dangerous for my pocketbook. Turns out, that minimalistic, \""wow, I might not get crushed by a haphazard box\"" layout that I so sorely missed is a HUGE plus in actually finding what you need - instead of wasting three hours combing through boxes that may or may not have the obscure Brian K. Vaughan copy i'm looking for.\n\nIt was a fly by visit, so I didn't ruin my bank account this first time around, but seeing as though I caught a glimpse of a first edition Sandman near the counter, you can bet your britches i'll be back."
0,"Stopped in here a little before midnight on a Friday night. The club is laid out kind of like a big living room with an outdoor patio in the back. Friend of mine chatted up some girls outside and got us in for free. Dress code didn't seem to be an issue. I was wearing a really casual polo and blue jeans (didn't have time to stop back at the hotel and change before going out due to other issues). Drinks were insanely priced (A \""short\"" redbull vodka was $17). The place was packed and cramped. Bartender service was terrible. The line was always 6 people deep, and the bartenders were in no hurry to get your drink. The other thing that really annoyed me was they stopped bar service for 10 minutes so they could do a mini-fashion show and have some lingerie models walk out on top of the bar. Once service started again the line for drinks was insanely long. Took 35 minutes to get a refill. I also got yelled at by a bouncer for sitting down at the \""wrong\"" couch. There was no one sitting on one particular cushion (enough for one person) although there were people seated at the other spots and nothing to indicate I couldn't sit there. The other people seated didn't seem to know each other. It even looked like all of the other couches, but he came by and said \""move it, VIP\"". I said \""excuse me?\"" Since I didn't even understand what he was referring to at this point. He got in my face and put his arm on my shoulder and said \""do we have a PROBLEM?!\"". Ridiculous. \n\nI could have had fun if the bartenders weren't incredibly slow, the staff was nicer, it wasn't incredibly overpriced, and it wasn't so packed. After all the other stuff I had a run-in with a snobby customer who seemed to think she owned the place and her little spot on the dance floor so that sealed the deal for me. I had to get out. I felt kind of bad, because the friend I was with really was enjoying herself dancing and wanted to stay but I really had enough."
0,"This Starbucks is worthy of mention only because it moved into the lobby of the former Plaza Theater.  The Plaza is where my friends and I (legally) first saw R-rated movies on our own.  I remember seeing \""Pulp Fiction\"" here.\n\nOtherwise, it's just a Starbucks."
0,ATTENTION all Brides or anyone else who even considers hiring Adam Brooks from Brooks Photography. HE is an absolute fraud!!!!! Adam will take your money and not deliver what is promised in the contract. He will basically disappear on you and will be impossible to reach. He has been recently pulled from Wedding Wire and and will soon be pulled from other wedding websites. Legal action is taking place from numerous people. Adam Brooks from Brooks photography is also in the process of changing his business name. Maybe things have caught up to him and he needs to start over with a new scam. I will be sure to let EVERYONE know his new name once i get all the details. There is no way we will let him do this to anyone else. Especially brides on a very memorable day for them. Wheres the zero star option?
1,Above average fried chicken and ribs delivered right to my office. I liked the potato salad and the mac n' cheese but I think everything would have been much better if eaten at the restaurant. 30-min in a foam box doesn't do this type of food any favors.
1,"Rooms in the tower are really pretty. Character comfort and the shower head delivers a soothing spray \""nice head!\"" 4th floor even gives good views with ability to open window a few inches to get a lil bit of outside or break from ac. Old style writing bureau and funky Polynesian themed couch with matching table all are nice touches. Clean and with an assortment of toiletries the Cortez is on a par with a much higher priced sub-Saharan hotel. \n\nAnd for those nostalgic fiends out there you can use quarters in the casino with rows and rows of bucket-wielding tranches of humanity sitting perched on chairs dinging and rustling their way to fortunes untold, or not as the case may be. But of course we ll never know cos as the adage goes: what happens in El Cortez costs a fraction of what it does elsewhere. Or something like that. You feel me?"
0,"High hopes not fulfilled\n\nThe recent re-opening of Taqueria Guadalajara had me in a taco state of mind, so the wife and I made the trip to the east side of Madison to El Poblano.  We knew the owner from her days at Tex Tubbs and were looking forward to her take on Mexican cuisine.  \n\nThe restaurant is in the parking lot of Woodman's East and hasn't changed a lot from its days as a Hardee's / Popeye's Chicken, other than a mural painted on the wall.  Some of the tables had embroidered table cloths under plastic, which was a nice touch, but many of the tables needed to be wiped down.  And the bullet hole in the window of our booth was a touch I could probably do without.\n\nOnce we were seated, we received a basket of chips with red salsa.  The chips were so-so; they didn't appear to be made fresh.  The red salsa was quite delicious, but the salsa verde (which you need to ask for) was the real star and we enjoyed our chips and salsa as we perused the menu.\n\nI ordered three tacos:\nThe fried tilapia was by far my favorite.  The interior was flaky and moist and the exterior was well seasoned.  I would have preferred a little crunch, but still a very solid offering.  The garnishes of spicy mayo, slaw and pickled red onion provided nice contrast of flavor and texture.  I would like to come back to try the blackened tilapia and the shrimp versions of their Taco Del Mar.\n\nThe el pastor taco was very dry, I needed to spoon on several spoonfuls of the salsa verde to overcome the dry, chewy texture.  The dish needed a sauce or a little pineapple to provide some moisture.  I'd take the el pastor as Los Gemelos over this dish any day.\n\nThe asada taco suffered from the same problem as the pork.  It was dry and chewy and needed several spoonfuls of the red salsa. It was my least favorite of the three tacos.\n\nMy wife ordered the chicken enchiladas.  The chicken was so dry that I could not cut off a section with my fork.  When she removed the chicken from the tortilla wrapper, the chicken stayed in cigar shaped tubes.  I was tempted to put one of the chicken tubes in my pocket as eat it like jerky, but decided that I didn't want to risk chipping a tooth.\n\nAt the end of the meal, my wife reminded me of her simple rule for evaluating restaurants: if the restaurant is almost empty at dinner time, there is a reason for that.  We really should have heeded that advice.  While I will return to try the other seafood tacos, she will not be accompanying me."
0,"Do not take your vehicle if you value your sanity and your money. This was the worst auto repair experience I've had and if I never have another experience like this one, it would still be too soon for me."
0,"The most bland, expensive soup I have ever had."
0,"If you like great steakhouses like Ruth's Chris, Morton's or The Palm, you won't like Stripsteak. One of the worst steak meals we've ever had. Service was very slow, took 45 min to get out raw oysters and a salad, and an hour and a half for a medium rare steak. Steak was not tender and very plain...grocery store steaks have more flavor. Please don't waste your time or money on this very over-hyped steakhouse."
1,"great stake as any other high end stake house, anything special ... I dint think so"
0,"Pizza it's always good.  However this place really needs an update or refurbishment on booths.\n  And they had music playing overhead that was more annoying than anything; lots of static.\nMusic, static and kids tv noise doesn't work!\n\nLast but not least.  Guy that took my order had Attitude Attitude Attitude."
1,"What fun shops! I have recently visited both locations for the first time, and I enjoyed my shopping experience very much.  First of all, I met the owner, Kat, and she is lovely, very kind & personable, along with all of her staff.  Everyone working there was courteous & friendly & helpful.  Secondly, I love the selection of labels & styles.  Very, very cute stores, can't wait to return for more shopping.  Plus, they are always posting new arrivals on Facebook which is nice.  I highly recommend this business!"
0,"I am usually a huge fan of Wildflower, but not of this location. The coffee was old and the food was cold. When I asked to get cooked potatoes they were very sweet but still gave me cold food. Disappointed!"
0,I ordered Pad Thai with beef A La Cart. First thing I noticed was it was a small portion.  Second thing was there wasn't much beef. Beef was a little tough but for the most part it was tasty. Different from many Thai places.\n\nI also ordered a large Tom Yum soup with chicken. Standard size amount. This too was prepared differently than most places. Chicken was tough and flavor was ehhhh \n\nPlace has seats for inside eating but restaurant is designed for take out.\n\nSmall portion sizes along with the cost makes this an undesirable place for me to return. For $23 ...I expected more
1,"I  love this place for what it is!  Cheesy decor, good late night eats, drinks  and friendly service, and for me memories of trips to Vegas as a child where this was our breakfast spot before heading back to CA.  Our party of six arrived at about 11 on a Saturday night and were quickly seated.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict and while they weren't the most amazing version of Eggs Benedict I ever had they were tasty and with three eggs and hash browns included more then enough for one person.  I would highly recommend the Key Lime Pie Martini.  Delicious and tasted just like the desert with a graham cracker crust  rim.  A photographer came by and offered to take \""free\"" pictures of our group with no obligation.  Of course to upgrade to a nice full size photo without the Peppermill logos all over turned into $10 but it was a nice memento of the evening and easily scanned and divided among six of us!"
0,"I don't understand how they are always out of beers on tap! I live right across the street from this one and get bad service all the time. \nBut I love to go to the hualapai one, the People are friendly and not rude!"
1,"Decided to switch up my regular spot for a while and give Jimmy and his retro decorated barbershop a few tries. I love the old school vibe, tv and machines and cool car-barber chair for the kiddos needing a chop. While I thought he did a decent job on my haircut I doubt I'll be back. I asked for a razor skin fade twice on two separate occasions and Jimmy still left some hair where there shouldn't have been. Ah well it seems like he's doing a bang up job with the other fellows on here so I'm not worried about him losing one guy. In the meantime I'll still continue to go to my regular spot in Hendertucky. 3.5 stars, rounding up."
0,"I was starving and this place was still disappointing. The gyro was not warm enough the meat was just salty,not flavorful.\n\nThe tabbouleh was $3.25 for a tiny cup that was mainly just filled with parsley. Possibly the most disappoint Greek food I've eaten. On top of it all the prices are pretty expensive even compared to mall prices. Nearly $12 for a small gyro and some tabbouleh? Maybe their prices could be more reasonable if they didn't hand out business cards with pointless quotes from ancient philosophers on them.\n\nThis place is pure garbage."
1,Excellent service! Food was delicious. My date and I shared the tortilla soup and the server graciously brought out an additional small bowl without us even asking. The enchilada con mole was fantastic! The side of beans that came with it reminded me of my Mexican grandfather's recipe and brought back great memories. We will most definitely be going back very soon! Highly recommend!!!
1,"Their Vietnamese dishes are on point; vermicelli, pho, and rice plates. The smoothies are also on point. Everything else, from what I've tried; Chinese dishes (orange chicken, lemon chicken, shumai), Thai dishes (curry, pad thai), aren't all that great. The spring rolls, egg rolls, pork buns and sesame balls are pretty awesome too."
1,"Whew, let me tell you, if there is an open parking space: 1) park 2) Dash inside 3) get a table!\n\nThis place is really popular.  So unique, too. On the surface, Korean/Mexican/Chinese fusion does not sound like it should work.  Well, as you can tell by the reviews & ratings, it does work & work well.\n\nAlso, come hungry, because the portions are, ahem, large.  Cheap, too!  Lotsa food & cheap, what every growing boy needs, right?\n\nI had a Pork Bulgogi taco & Chicken bulgogi fried rice.  The classic, eyes too big for my stomach situation.  The taco was tasty & spicy, with a mild sweetness (bulgogi, of course). It was pretty big for a street taco, but, I think that is becoming the trend for street tacos. The chicken fried rice was more than plentiful, with chicken, egg, carrots, peas, & scallions.  Some ginger & garlic in there, too I think.  Light on the soy sauce which is a welcome change from street corner Chinese fare.\n\nThe place itself is pretty tight on space & the food takes a bit to prepare, but this is not fast food.\n\nIf you're in the area, you owe it to yourself to drop in & try."
0,"I brought my friend here for her Birthday. It was her first time at Massage Envy. The front office girl was very loud and annoying. My friend was told she would have a therapist that could give her deep tissue massage. She was not happy with her massage and it was not deep enough. I told my Threapist that I was having back pain in my lower back. All he concentrated on was that area and nothing else. Being a professional, I thought he would know he had to massage the surrounding area in order for me to feel relief.  I left with my lower back feeling better but the rest of my back was in A LOT of pain and still is. I was not happy with my experience at all.\nAlso, as a member I thought I would be taken care of better but I was treated no better than a non-member. My membership doesn't get me anything special. Pay three times as much as a membership to LVAC and don't even get as many massages as you want. Or at least go twice a week. Total rip off. Pay full price and only perks come if you refer someone and they sign up. Don't waste your money here. If you're in pain, look up a chiropractor that has massages in office."
1,"By far this was the most wonderful steak experience.  After arriving in Vegas for a girl's weekend, we were hungry for some good eats.  When I called to check in with my boyfriend, he had mentioned that he had gotten a thank you card from Del Frisco's after going there during SEMA and highly suggested that we try it.    I ordered the house salad, filet and shrimp, and the creamed spinach.  The salad came with two pieces of crispy bacon on top, the vinaigrette that it was tossed in was okay, I think  i would get it with the house ranch dressing next time.  The steak and shrimp were amazing.  The filet was the most tender  piece of steak I've ever had.  I tried the Chateau potatoes that my friend got and they were amazing.  The creamed spinach was like no other, with chopped pieces of bacon.  Good thing I don't eat like this every day.  a week later I got a thank you note too.  guess I need to go back soon."
1,"Impressed with the quality of the food given that its quick eats healthy food. The greek salad is huge and tasty. Ohh for greek salad snobs sorry this is not a greek salad that does not actually have salad buy great nonetheless. Nice fish sizes with your meal, for the price, I had the salmon very good. If you like deserts I tried the key lime pie (don't do it, I swear it was a edwards frozen slice thawed). Overall good place for the people who care about living longer and for those who don't it tastes good so try it anyway."
1,This is one of our favorite places to go as a family.  The food and atmosphere are great.
1,"Best customer service in town; the owner introduced herself by name and gave me time to browse the menu and ask questions, without making me feel rushed.\n\nCozy place with lots of natural light and a cute fireplace in the corner.  The cat decor can be a little much if you're not a cat person (like myself) but that's easily made up for by the quality of the coffee and the pleasantness of the staff!"
1,"I've heard a lot of good things about Serendipity 3 from my friends who came to Vegas on vacation, but I never had a chance to eat there until recently. Since this place was close to the Linq, a friend and I decided to eat here.\n\nThere was a helpful banner that said that the restaurant was open which was nice since it looked like part of the outside was under construction. We entered from the side and the hostess greeted us warmly before directing us to a table. The decor was a little goofy looking, but I liked it.\n\nThe menu was huge and it took a bit for me to figure out what to order. It finally came down to ordering a portobello mushroom burger with fries because I love mushrooms. My friend ordered a salad with a crab cake.\n\nThe food arrived and the first bite of my burger was amazing. My friend took a bite of her rather large crab cake and was pleased that the crab was fresh instead of frozen. Our waiter kept coming around to ask us how we were doing and refilling our water, which I like."
0,One star is generous.  But there are no minus stars available.Ssooooooo disappointed.   Let's face it the Cosmopolitan commercials are better. They try to be hip and trendy with exotic food offerings but fail miserably. Dishes are dry and tasteless.  Spent almost $40 for carbs and sone sugar. What??!!!  No prime rib or turkey?  Oh ya mashed potatoes were pretty good and the white chocolate mousse thing okay.  Go to Bacchanel instead
1,What a view from the patio! That's what makes the $10 drinks tolerable. \nA little weird dancing on carpet with heels on... but it works. The decor is so cool and eclectic. Tons to look at. \nGreat music playing and videos above the bar. I was having 90s flashbacks.\nDid you notice to private lockers for celebrities near the elevators. Very cool.
1,"Wow, I really like Humble Pie. The thing is I've lived right around the corner from this restaurant for over 2 years now and have been there a couple times, but recently I came in with family and was shocked at home much I loved the food. Actually, it's kinda of funny story how we ended up reuniting with Humble Pie... we tried to take family to Tryst Cafe next door at 7pm and were told by someone on their waitstaff that they close at 8, so if we are going to take awhile, we should go somewhere else. WHAT?!?! Well of course we immediately left and went right next door to a more than happy to serve us Humble Pie. \n\nThe pizza at Humble Pie is unique, but has such a good crust it's unbelievable. I just love the taste of that darn crust. They have good cheap wines, excellent salads, and tasty appetizers. Also, my Husband and I used to come here JUST to get an order of their cheesecake to go--- it's that GOOD. The last time we were here we have the pizza cookie and it also was amazing. \n\nAll in all, we've been eating here a lot more frequently and I'm so happy we rediscovered it's goodness. Thanks to Humble Pie for accepting our business happily... unlike it's next door neighbor..."
1,Food is delicious and staff is very prompt.  \n\nThe one thing I absolutely love about this restaurant is how clean the bathroom is!!!  I was completely stunned and amazed when I walked in.
1,"Brought the kiddos here to check it out and found that they really had a wide variety of activities. My daughter loved the art area, the big climbing tower and the little pretend area (store, ice cream stand and kitchen). My son enjoyed the toddler room and the shopping area (mainly pushing the carts!). Facilities were nice and clean and it wasn't super crowded. I felt it was a bit pricey ($11 per person) especially since there was no adult vs. child rate as I've seen in other children's museums."
1,"Not a bad restaurant at all. The Bauer Kitchen has an upscale pub feel. They have a pretty decent selection of mixed drinks. I had the rosebud which is sparkling wine with rosewater and something else I can't quite remember and it was quite delicious. My fiend and I followed that up with a duck entr\u00e9e, where I substituted the roasted potatoes for sweet potato fries and she for mashed potatoes. My meal was excellent. Best duck I've had in the city by far. My boyfriend had the rib special; he didn't like the sauce very much. He found it too sweet, but he also didn't ask what the ribs were cooked in before ordering, so to me, that's not a knock against the restaurant. The garlic mashed potatoes were well received, and the pizza was well liked by the fourth person in attendance. We didn't get any desert. It was on the expensive side and not very appealing - plus Vincenzo's is connected to the restaurant via indoor tunnel and who can resist their selection of takeaway pastries? \n\nAll four of us liked the atmosphere. Our jackets were hung up for us upon arrival, we were seated almost immediately and our waiter was friendly. He even came around every once in a while and poured us water from the bottle that he left at our table! The only real complaint that we had was the noise level in the restaurant. It was quite busy when we went arrived (around 6:30 on a Thursday night), the tables were close together, and there was music playing in the background. So, at times, we found it hard to talk to one another. Otherwise, a great experience."
1,"WORTH EVERY PENNY!!! Yes, this place can be a little pricey. For my large vegetarian pizza with chicken and a family sized Greek Salad it hits about $40, but it easily and happily feeds 3 greedy people. The Take-out is efficient and they even have Take-out parking. Sometimes I dine-in and when I do the service is always friendly and prompt. They have a fairly decent happy hour too!"
0,"If I was rating this place for how sweet the girl that works here was...then I would give this place 5 stars. Unfortunately, though, the food did disappoint a good bit.\n\nThe iced coffee was standard fare, rather large (which was great) but it wasn't made at the table, which always makes me sad.\n\nThe spring rolls were alright, but the peanut sauce was sickly looking and the fish sauce had nothing swimming in it. So sad...\n\nThe pho itself was decent. Nothing that stood out about it or not. The sizing was very reasonable and there was plenty of meat for my pho tai."
1,A really cool retro tiki-bar!  Great drinks and ambiance in a friendly atmosphere.  Highly recommended!
0,"Well, it started off well... As I was walking up to the door, an employee about to go on break stopped and held the door open for me. That was nice and, frankly, a notch above the service one expects or usually gets at a fast food joint.  Unfortunately, that all went to hell the moment I walked in the door.\n\nThere was only one other customer in the place and his facial expression - that borderline look between frustration & constipation - should have tipped me off.  There were two employees in the cook line as they were so engrossed in their conversation that they didn't see or hear me come in.  Despite my \""Excuse me's\"" & audible sighs they didn't bother to acknowledge me. One of these ladies was a manager.  The other one, working the line, had plastic gloves on but kept touching her shirt as she stood there making the food order in between squeaking with the manager.\n\nI wasn't acknowledged until the drive thru girl came out of the bathroom still zipping up her pants.  When she finally asked if I had been helped yet, I politely said, \""No, and I've changed my mind.\""\n\nThe customer that was there when I walked in, who was still waiting for his food order, started laughing out loud as I walked out.  Sad, actually, if you stop to consider that he was actually going to eat the food that the gloved employee that kept touching her shirt was making for him...\n\nNot coming back to this Taco Bell - ever!"
1,"I told myself that on my next trip to Vegas, I was gonna try one of the nicer buffets on the Strip. My husband & I stayed at Paris, and it was a choice between Wicked Spoon and The Buffet. While I was intrigued by Wicked Spoon's mac and cheese bar, we went to the Bellagio.\n\nWe waited in line for about 45 minutes on a Monday night. It was worth the wait. The prime rib was awesome; the Kobe sirloin was even better. The cold shrimp was fresh, and the pasta had lots of flavor. Even the sea bass was good, and I never eat sea bass. I tried four of their desserts: my favorite was the tiramisu. The only thing I didn't like much was the shrimp in the paella, but that's a very minor quibble. \n\nOverall: great food, our server was really nice, even when she forgot my water, and it was definitely the best buffet we'd ever eaten at (at this point, anyway). It's definitely worth the splurge... although the Friday/Sat. prices seem a bit steep."
0,I really love me some cupcakes. So when I found out this joint was serving cupcakes made by winners from cupcake wars - I was like HELL YES. So were they nice looking cupcakes? Yes. But you know they were just not that tasty at all. kind of dry. I got a coconut and got the birthday cake for my daughter since we were sampling to possibly purchase for her birthday party. I really wanted to love them. But I didnt. I might go back for some coffee but for the mean time im sticking to Sprinkles for my cupcakes.
1,"We like the extensive menu.  Most of the items are pretty good.  Some of the items we have tried are truly great.  My personal fav is the Spicy Tie Chicken Pasta (or something like that).  The first time I ordered it I thought it was absolutely perfect:  Nice and spicy, pasta done al dente, some crunchy corn strips for texture...sauce is addictive.  Other times I've ordered it seemed less spicy (but still good).\n\nAlso a plus:  service is always courteous, place is always clean."
1,A true bakery! It's just not in my budget. \n\nEverything here looks great. And the decor is neat and nice. I bet if they had some music playing customers would be inclined to linger at the lobby counter space with their treats. The window lighting is terrific. The buttermilk scone was sooo good! I just love a scone with coffee in the morning. The vanilla Twinkie and its surprise berry filling is my absolute favorite. And dipped in chocolate too... Yum yum!  \n\nBut the prices were too high for me. I was looking for a quick treat after lunch and the goodies were too high in the $4-$7 range. I realize quality comes at a cost. Maybe if smaller cookie/bar treats were offered at a smaller price point I would come back more often. I'll have to build up some cash for the $7 small pies. Looks delish!
1,"Gorgeous, simply beautiful.\nModern elegance, this is for sure one of the new highlights on the strip.\nThe chandelier breathtaking, the shops and restaurants, nightclubs, everything is carefully selected and top notch.\nHad I not had a bad dining experience here it would be 5 stars, this is where the young, hot rich elite stays, get a piece of the pie and enjoy a stay here it will be memorable for sure."
1,A worthy addition to LV Ramen community (namely Monta and Sora)
0,"Waaay overpriced and the portion sizes are a joke. I ordered the Berkshire pork, $35, and the meat was about the diameter of a silver dollar and 1/2 inch thick. Side dishes, which they say are for sharing, about 1/2 cup each.\nSo loud in the restaurant you really can't talk to each other."
0,"My husband and I were excited to see Ka because I had heard it was the only one of the Cirque shows with a story line.  We also got front row seats, which we were very excited about.  We became very disappointed about both as the show went on.\n\nThere is so much things flying over the audience's heads, blocked views and bad angles from being so close, the most expensive seats are easily the worst in the house.  =(\n\nThe story was ok.  But hard to follow considering they spoke no English when they talked.  When they did talk it was a jumble of Japanese, Italian, Swahili, and gibberish, depending on the origin of the actor.  Pick one and stick to it please, I may not understand you, but I know what each sound like.  I also didn't understand why the floors turned into walls and started rotating at some points.  It just didn't make sense.\n\nBoth my husband and I thought the tricks where bland and basic circus acts.  My husband had a hard time following the story because their was no talking and because of his lack of interest after seeing people dressed up as giant insects and animals.  This show is geared to much younger audiences.  My husband mentally checked out after he saw someone in a puppeteered turtle costume do the moon walk.\n\nThis show is great for small children and if you sit further back.  If you are taking a vacation without the kiddies, skip this show.  The only way I would have found this entertaining would be if I was 5 years old."
1,"I don't know why this place has such bad reviews -- I loved it. And I'm from San Francisco and Los Angeles, so it's not like I'm used to different standards.\n\nSERVICE:\nOur waiter was great. He was always courteous, always checked on us, and joked around with our group, too. I have absolutely zero complaints about him.\n\nDRINKS:\nWe had a bottle of a dry New Zealand white. Can't go wrong with that. Went with the food perfectly, and the $50 price tag wasn't overpriced for the quality. (They had plenty of options in the $20-$30 range, as well.)\n\nFOOD:\nLoved the oysters. Very fresh and tasty, and come with everything you might want on the side. The steamed mussels and fried calamari were also excellent appetizers. By the way, THE APPETIZERS ARE BIG. Great to split for 2 people.\nAs for the entree, the seafood Cioppino was excellent. Great mix of seafood in a delicious sauce. (Also very large portion -- great to split)."
1,Best little tucked away spot in the hotel.
0,service sucks and the food sucks. I don't recommend this restaurant at all. I would never eat here again.
1,"Been going to this nail salon over a year.  Before I was a loyal polished girl. I love how much detail and thought Hanna puts into each manicure I get. I'm by far hard on my nails.  I worked at a blow dry bar washing hair all day and using hair color, products and normal nail wear and tear I noticed no matter what I did my gel nails would peel or break until Hanna. She's been my saving grace,  her and ibd lol! I can always stretch out my appointments at least 4 weeks, I've been known to go 6 or 7 though and I've never returned with a messed up nail. Their instagram shows the artwork but the true test is when you have stiletto nails, no acrylics and just gel polish that last more than 4 weeks you know you found a nail salon to keep on speed dial! Plus they have over 25 pedicure choices. ..so many!! Prices are more than fair for the service and Nate always has music playing. They do eyelash extensions as well, haven't tried them but definetly interested!"
0,"We dined here this evening and I had such high hopes for this place, mostly because I've been to the location at Boca Park and the service and food is always great.\n\nBeing restaurant managers and coming from food service backgrounds ourselves my boyfriend and I tend to take it easy on our fellow comrades, but this was a little crazy. The only reason we are giving one star is because we could tell most of the issues might have been resolved if the poor waitress didn't have so many tables in her section.\n\nTo begin our party was a surprise dinner planned by myself and a friend for her husband. Everyone was to arrive by 6:45 and the birthday boy was to arrive promptly at 7pm. At 6:53pm the hostess came over to our table where 95% of us had already arrived and had our drink order taken and told us that there was a miscommunication and that that table was for another party arriving shortly. According to her our table was ready outside. I asked her if we could make the switch RIGHT AWAY that we would go. She assures me it is, walks out to the patio (maybe unaware I was following her) and proceeds to look bewildered at the scattered empty tables and heaters. Long story short, the guys in our party rushed to put this table together, our table had 2 heaters for 15 of us, we did not receive menus/share plates/silverware for quite sometime, and our server took even longer to take our food order. \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: I was not going to write a YELP about this experienced as I noticed all the tables the server had inside (and, again, I tend to take it easy on industry in situations like this), but the kicker came when I politely pulled the manager aside to give him a friendly heads up about the situation and he took zero blame and made no apologies. According to him it was entirely the servers responsibility to ask for help and as far as he was concerned all the tables he saw of hers were doing good (although he mentioned the only table he didn't know about, conveniently, was ours). Interesting to know given that I walked to the restroom and host stand several times for separate reasons, keeping my eyes peeled for a manager that was never there. In my professional opinion it is NEVER OK to make excuses to your guest and blame your staff. Was this guy serious? My intention was to give him a friendly heads up as a fellow restaurant manager and instead I left feeling more disappointed and a little bit disgusted.\n\nMy hope is that this particular manager reads this YELP and realizes the effect of his words and demeanor. Customer service rule #1 : The guest is always right. (even when they're not) and in this case we definitely were. Not sure I care to give this place another try in the near future. Hope this helps GM (I'm assuming this manager was not the GM)."
0,"the bartenders at VICTORYS were awful.  Slow to even take your drink order and weird looks.  My wife and I were in there gambling and wanted to have lunch, the place was really slow, bartenders standing around goofing off, it was a younger thin mexican guy and a shorter middle aged white lady, we waited for 10 to 15 minutes and were playing video poker, just rude!"
1,"Yet another great experience at Jalapeno Inferno today. Came in around 4:30, right before the Sunday dinner rush. Service was great, our waitress was friendly and attentive. We were promptly served delicious flour tortilla chips which are dangerously good. Tonight I ordered the blood orange margarita which was tart and delicious.\n\nI had a sampler platter tonight which included a corn tamale, mini fundido's, a green chile quesadilla and queso w/ spinach. Everything was absolutely delicious. I ate way too much because it was oh so good! My fiance had the queso skillet chicken which was amazing as usual. The ambiance is also really nice here and it was a beautiful day to have the patio open with a nice breeze.\n\nOverall I am very impressed with Jalapeno Inferno. I will be back to try more!\n\n(Going to try the lobster taco's on the next visit)"
1,"Me and my wife have a membership to the zoo - and well - would totally recommend it to everyone.  we use it all the time - heck i would go every week if she would let me.  there is just something about sitting at the zoo - in the weather - with the people  - enjoying the day.\n\nnot all animals look happy there, or comfortable for that matter, but some really do look like they are oblivious that they are at the zoo.\n\nit is a huge zoo - it would take most the day to see all of it.  it is so relaxing to just go for a coulpe of hours and then leave.\n\nwe have been where we didn't see anyone for 20 minutes, and on the busiest day and never felt that there were crowd problems.\n\nthe zoo does does seem to do too much to just want your money - you pay a good fee to get in and then there are places everywhere to take more money from you - opportunity cost eh.\n\nmy current favoirtes are the big horn sheep up in the corner - and just sitting and watching the movement at the savana.  it is like my crack.\n\nsome people sit by the pool and relax - i site by the savana and relax"
1,"I've never been to a sports bar with such great food, makes Buffalo Wild Wings seem like a soup kitchen. Had the NY strip, can't really make it any better. Had this waiter named Zaben or Zabin, and he couldn't have been more accommodating. We watched UFC 159 there, and I'd like to make this my usual place for those ppv's from now on."
0,I detest this place. It used to be amazing! Brings back fond memories of coming here with my mom. I don't know what happened in the 11 years since I last ate here but it's gone downhill. \n\nThe first part is a  review of the take out we ordered. \n\nPad Thai was wayy too sweet and oily. \n\nSoups had a thick layer of oil. \n\nCurry was bland and flavorless. We ordered this takeout once and they put the rice under the curry. I've never had curry take out that served it this way. It's usually separate. \n\nMy mom never throws food out. This was a first for me to see her throw out three entrees right away. \n\nCame here after an exam to meet with friends. Deciding to give it one more shot. The chicken with veggie dish I ordered was actually ok. What made me mad was when I ordered hot water NOT TEA the woman behind the counter brought me tea with my meal. I politely told her oh I actually just wanted hot water she sternly said they don't offer  just hot water and made no attempt to take tea away. (It was already brewed in the cup when she brought it.)  we just looked at each other for a minute.  I took the tea and vowed  in my head  that due to the customer service and bad food I would never set foot in this establishment again.
0,"I don't normally write negative reviews but the service we got at this place was less than stellar.  On a Friday night we popped in to get a round of drinks before last call.  We ordered a couple Espolon shots and a beer for the 2 of us to share.  After waiting at the least crowded bar for about 10 minutes, (which is to be expected at a Scottsdale bar on the weekend), the bartender stood about 7 feet away from me where the customers he was just dealing with were and instead of walking over to get my order just looked over in my direction with a goofy look on his face.  I waited, since I'm a quiet person and I thought he was going to walk over but, no, just a goofier look in return to my smile so I screamed my order at him from there.  He brought out our tequila shots unchilled with no salt, not even a lime to speak of.  I get that if you don't specify you want your shot chilled they probably won't do it, even though good bartenders will ask, but not even asking if we wanted salt seems like amateur hour to me and not giving us limes when he could've reached them with one arm from where he was standing when he gave us our drinks is just straight up lazy.  I ordered tequila shots in London that came out right.  The bar had to ask but the point is they tried.  This is AZ people.  I'm in the service industry so I'm going to tip well almost no matter what but I wish some bartenders in Scottsdale wouldn't make me hate myself for it in the morning."
0,ridiculous waste of time   disorganized zoo 1 star only for the people watching
0,"Was it fun? Absolutely! However, we purchased the Groupon for this location and it says you get a lot of items that were not offered. For two people we should have received racing suits and shoes to wear, a sticker, an autographed poster, and a bottle of water. We received none of this. It might be fun, but customer service is important! When you pay for something that states you should receive things, the company should honor their promotion."
1,"First off, let me just tell you that traffic getting to The Cosmopolitan/Marquee is absolutely horrendous.  Granted, this may have been because it was 11:30PM on a Friday night, but that's besides the point.  I would strongly suggest getting here as early as you can.\n\nWe were told to meet our promoter by midnight.  We walked right in through the entrance towards the back of the casino, and then up a set of escalators.\n\nAround the Chandelier you'll see a massive group of people to the right.  It didn't seem like there was any sort of method to the madness.  Luckily,  we were told to go to the 3rd floor and meet up with the promoter.  There were WAY less people up there.  We told them who we were with, and got let in for free with no problem.\n\nLittle did we know that we were about to go up 6 flights of stairs, in heels mind you.  We made it to the Boom Box Room which mostly plays Hip-Hop music.  Our promoter gave us a little tour and took us up to the pool area and main (house) room.  We also got drink tickets--super cool of him!\n\nMarquee is HUGE, and just plain beautiful.  The view from the club is a little bit ridiculous.  As we headed into the house room, I noticed this girl on the floor.  Then I saw security lighting a flashlight in her face.  Turns out, she fell in someone else's throw up on the ground.  How nasty is that?  The look of utter disgust was enough for me, I felt awful for her.  I hope they gave her a comped room or something for her to get cleaned up.\n\nAside from that nasty little incident, we headed straight for the dance floor.  I'm not a huge fan of house music and it was a difficult to move as there were SO many people crammed into one area.  Made me think of Rain and how the dance floor there gets full so fast.\n\nWe decided to go to the hip-hop room in hopes of more space and better music.  DJ Politik was spinning lots of hits and we were dancing the night away.  One guy was a TAD bit too pushy with trying to dance with my bestie, one of the girls in my group almost beat him up, literally.\n\nAll in all, we had a great time til our feet started hurting.  We then called it a night and headed for Pho So 1 for a wonderful late night meal!"
1,"We went to Harris Grill for lunch while a friend was visiting from out of town-and it was fun! The menu and atmosphere is pretty entertaining. The food and drinks are moderately priced, and there is a nice selection of brews.\n\nWhat we had:\n\nTurkey Burger-fabulous-we agreed this was the best thing we had ( I added mozzarella cheese and it was soooo good)\n\nFlat Iron Pork-I guess our friend thought he was ordering flat iron steak-this was ok but I wouldn't get it again.\n\nSome Spicy Chicken sandwich-Pretty good-paled in comparison to the turkey burger\n\nTots-Delicious\n\nBeer-good! (duh)\n\nOther:\nService-Fab!\n\n2 Patios-front and back"
0,"Don't know what's so good about this place anymore.  The food used to be great when they first started, but after years of changing ownerships, the food services started to drop.  Used to be good waiting in line to get into the place, now it's not a fun idea to wait in line anymore when they aren't even busy at all.  All their bouncers are just bad at their job, it's suppose to be a hospitality place inviting people into their place, now they are just turning people away.  You have to tip them a lot to get in, this is NOT Vegas, this is Scottsdale.  Stop thinking that people in Arizona will spend a lot of money going to a dump place like this.  Time to find a new place to go on the weekend.  This place should just go rot in hell."
0,"It's a vey busy place on a cold November night. I was really not impressed. Yes, the thin pizza crust from the wood oven is good, but the ingredients are out of balance: too much arugula on mine, too little mozzarella. Same lack of balance for my 3 friends, It is really average pizza by all means. If you like a busy restaurant, the settings are OK and the service decent, but for the food and price, you can easily get better."
0,"I used to love this place until they just did one of the most cocky, arrogant things a restaurant can do, charge a $5 share fee. My girlfriend and I used to love to come and split an appetizer and then share a pan roast. Now they charge us $5 extra. It's not a split plate fee where we are asking them for anything additional for sharing,we just eat out of the same bowl. How is this even legal? I bought this bowl of soup and now if I give some to my girlfriend I owe you $5 more? This is just greed on its face and something and establishment will do when they think they have loyal customers that will stand for anything. Not me, I am not going back until they remove this ridiculous fee. The waitress was even embarrassed when I asked where that came from.. Said it was new and apologized."
1,"So we (husband, daughter, me) have been coming here for a few years. Never disappointed. Yum bbq.  Don't go expecting fancy; go to let your hair down, watch some sports on one of two flat screens, have a beer and awesome bbq. You'll end up feeling like part of the family--that loves Scottsdale BBQ!!  Sandwiches are ginormous.  My husband and I always split one and get two sides."
0,"The boyfriend and I were looking to branch out from our usual breakfast haunts but the minute we pulled up to Black Bear Diner we should have kept driving to The Farmhouse in Gilbert. One look at this place and we should have known this was not gonna be great.\n\nBlack Bear Diner is pretty much a bear-themed Denny's. I ordered the \""small portion\"" breakfast and boyfriend ordered pancakes. My small breakfast was 2 eggs, a huge portion of hashbrowns, a gigantic biscuit and bacon. There was nothing small about this breakfast. The menu said for seniors and smaller appetites. They've got some hungry seniors in Gilbert apparently.\n\nThe eggs were tasteless and the bacon was meh. The hashbrowns were good though, I'll give them that. Boyfriend's pancakes were also flavorless and really thick and heavy. Nothing light and fluffy about these flapjacks. They were kinda like a brick with syrup.\n\nWe left feeling like we had wasted our weekend breakfast. Maybe lunch or dinner is better but I don't think we'll be back to find out."
1,"This barre studio is fabulous. I have tried barre at different places, and this is probably my favorite. The instructors really challenge you, and they are always making sure you have the right form. Even two days after a work out I am still feeling it, but still looking forward to the next class! Alyssa is very helpful and responds timely, despite how busy she gets!  And having this studio right across the street from my house doesn't hurt either! :)"
0,"I have tanned here for the past couple years,  only in the month or so leading into summer. I am always very clear that I am not interested in a membership and I pay cash at that time. Last year they insisted on having my ATM card on record even though I was paying cash but assured me that if there were any charges made to my account all I would have to do is call the corporate office. sure enough the first of the next month they charged the membership fee to my account. Every month for six months thereafter they charged my account. I sent emails and called their corporate office countless times during that time, never any response. Ultimately, I had to handle it through my financial institution and have them block them as an authorized retailer for accessing my account. This year I went in for my same pre-summer tanning sessions and they told me I owed them over $400. Once again I explain that I had never been interested in a membership and have never signed up for one. I was able to contact the corporate office at that point in time and got the matter straightened out, all charges were removed because I had never used any other sessions other than the month I had paid for (which is what I told the girl I was purchasing in the first place). I went back into the salon once again paid cash and started tanning, figuring I would put my best foot forward. I went in the following month and paid cash once again for my month of tanning, I just went in the store to try to tan and they informed me that I owe them over $200 for my unpaid \""membership\"" for the past two months. I explained to the girl I did not have a membership & I did not authorize you to access my account. I have paid cash anytime I was interested in tanning sessions. She says I am not tanning if I don't pay. I called the corporate office and got voicemail so I called back to the billing department as I was explaining the situation the girl hung up on me. When I attempted to call her back the line continues to ring busy. I was not raising my voice or being disrespectful or rude in any way. In a city this size with so many options for tanning salons I don't know why they continue to try to pull the scam with their membership fees and charges. If I wanted a membership I would sign up for it. I will never use the salon again and I do not recommend it to anyone else."
0,"This was the show I was looking forward to the most. I'm glad it was the first one we saw so I could get my disappointment out of the way. Holly is in the show a total of like five minutes and she doesn't do anything. The most impressive part was her entrance which sadly leads you to believe the show will be good but the best part of the whole thing was the ending... as in when we realized the torture was over. All she does is sit on the stage and occassionally walk around. If you took her out of this show (and lets face it, thats why we all went to it anyway) there would be ABSOLUTLEY NO REASON TO GO. The dancing was less than entertaining and the music was horrible. We paid over $400 for two tickets so we could have vip and do the meet and greet. As if the show wasn't a big enough waste of money, we got to take pictures with holly post show, wig off, hair in a bun, and dressed in a SWEAT suit!!!! I rather would've gambled that money away with a playboy bunny dealer at the palms playboy club. At least there you know what to expect and you're mildly entertained while blowing your money. Not to mention you can take your picture with the bunnies and they actually look good. My fascination with Holly is officially over. This long time devoted fan is over it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS SHOW."
0,"I came here with my family yesterday (group of 5). It was a 15 minute wait which wasn't horrible and then they called us up. We came up to the hostess stand and just stood there waiting for about 5 minutes. I finally asked the hostess why she would call us up if our table wasn't ready. The hostess supervisor overheard me and got involved....apparently what happened was the hostess seated another smaller party at the table set for our group. We watched the hostess go up to the newly seated group which had been seated for about 5 minutes, and KICK THEM OUT of the booth. I felt horrible for the other group. This started the slow and unimpressive meal  :/\n\nOur waiter was just kinda sloppy. He was REALLY SWEATY (like just ran a marathon sweaty and sweat rolling down his face and neck) and unorganized. He had no idea what was on the menu-for example, someone ordered Moroccan Chicken, he asked her if she wanted mashed potatoes with that or a salad but the dish didn't even come with those items, it came with couscous. He made the same mistake with my MIL's entree choice too.  He then tried to push the brunch options but brunch ended at 2pm so it wasn't even available. He didn't even know what time it was.\n\nThe menu itself was FILLED with advertisements for an assortment of crap, very off putting to me as I just want to pick my meal, not be subjected to page after page of crappy ads.  as It took 20 minutes for him to bring bread, 1 HOUR (yes HOUR) for appetizers, another 45 minutes for entrees. I asked him to bring water for our table for everyone, he brought ONE. When we finally got our entrees, they only came out partially. A member of our group was without his entree for a while and was stuck staring at everyone's food. In the 3 HOURS that it took to get everything we ordered, he refilled our drinks once. I ordered a turkey burger and was not impressed.....it needed more flavor, seasoning and the fries were unappetizing and tasted slightly freezer burnt. \n\nMy MIL insisted on dessert so we all got cheesecake (a variety). It took an additional 25 minutes for cheesecake, AS IF it takes 25 minutes to slice a darn cheesecake and plate it?? By the time we had ordered dessert, the place had cleared out for the most part and was NOT busy so there was NO excuse whatsoever for the length of time the service took.\n\nBy the end of our meal, we could NOT WAIT to leave. My MIL is very shy and gets embarrassed  easily so I didn't raise a fuss with management but this was my first time dining here and it was so unpleasant. I was hugely disappointed\n with the entire experience. \n\nSave your cash for a place with better food, better service, perhaps less sweaty servers."
1,"I love that I found my go-to scottsdale spa!  Racheal does my hair (cut and highlights) and she is amazing, I wouldn't go anywhere or to anyone else.  I love that they have a ton of amenities (including a small pool!) so everytime I go, I can spend as much time as I want there.  They offer small snacks and tea/water and the staff is just so friendly and inviting.  Definitely would recommend Spa Lamar to anyone looking for a relaxing, enjoyable  spa day. Two thumbs up!!"
0,We are regulars here. On may 2. 2014  our usual party of five showed up for my sons birthday. Now we love eating here but as we were seated in the back at the teppan table a large cockroach crawled out from the side of the grill and headed toward my daughter....the manager just smiled said he would kill it and moved us to the next table! No offers of any kind followed! This was disgusting and will surely end our  twice monthly dinners there-gross!!!
1,My younger child took his first classes there this week. He had an absolute blast! Both instructors (both named Emily) were great with my child.
0,"I have been a customer of chipotle for over 10 years now and this I by far the worst chipotle I have ever been to. The management staff is terrible and treats their employees like your ordering from an assembling line. No personality at all. When ordering you can hardly understand them because all they focus on is getting to the next person. And when you do answer them back, they don't even listen and have to repeat yourself two or three times. Get ready to have your blood pressure raised while ordering. The food is always never ready and I find myself always having to wait for something to be cooked. Usually I wouldn't mind waiting for hot food, but it comes with a cost. And that cost is the rest of your burrito is cold from sitting waiting for the food in the assembly line. \n\nOverall, because of the poor management and atmosphere I am giving this a 2 out of 5.  The only reason I am giving it a 2 is because, well its chipotle and I love the food for over 10 years. Fix the management and allow the customers to have an enjoyable experience and I will come back. I'm tired from ordering from a manager who spends more time yelling to hurry hurry to his employees to get to the next person and eating cold food. Can't wait for the location in Stonecrest to open!"
1,I love going to Highland Park for a walk with my husband. I find it very relaxing! The reservoirs are pretty gross but I try not to look at it. It looks like breeding ground for mosquitoes.
1,"Wonderful food, drinks, service, and atmosphere.  I recommend this favorite of mine to everyone!"
0,Lady with lip piercing didn't seen welcoming. She was annoyed it seemed that I was there. I had a frosty it was like most and I had a value fry which was also good! Food is good just work on the friendliness and welcoming attitude please.
1,"It's FREE. Enough said.\n\nThe museum is expansive so there's a lot to look at. Definitely a nice way to pass time on a rainy afternoon.\n\nSome exhibits charge a fee (when I went, it was the Mary, Queen of Scots exhibit) but it's often worth the price, considering everything else is FREEEEE."
0,"Everyone likes Dos except for me it seems, which is a shame since it's cheap, near campus, and the service is good. What can I say? The meat quality reminds me of The Jungle, the \""spicy\"" sauces are incredibly bland, and everything seems to be soaked in puce-colored refried beans. \n\nThe hilarious thing is how every item on the menu is pretty much the same...there is very little difference between the tacos, the burritos, the tamales, or anything else. Entrees are a lot better than the specials. The carne asada tacos, while very much not carne asada, are OK. The ambiance can be summed up with a description of the walls: pink and orange sponge paint. \n\nDos Reales has a lot of loyal fans, but I prefer El Charro or Los Amigos."
0,"I used to get Jimmy Johns all of the time when I was down at the good ol' UofA, so now that I work on Mill I was excited to try them again!\nI don't know if this location is different, if my taste buds have evolved since I was 19, or if I have to be completely shit faced to eat here, but this place is ewwwwww\nLike others have said, they use way to much mayo. WAY TOO MUCH. And no other condiment really... Their subs consist of 90% lettuce/sprouts, 8% mayo and 2% misc(meaning mystery meat, tomatoes, maybe cheese, etc)\nI just don't get why anyone would want to eat here? Unless they're drunk! I would totally eat here drunk, but then again, I'll eat ANYTHING when I'm drunk..."
1,"I don't give many 5 stars, in fact,  I'm like the Josh Bell of food reviewers. (See if anyone gets that one) \nFor me, good pizza crust is a must and the sauce is boss. Yes I'm poetic about it because that's what this pizza is, worthy of poems!\nThe crust is crispy with bit of chewiness where it matters. The sauce is tangy and not overly sweet, just the way it should be.\nYes, real cheese (duh) and ingredients galore are all good.\n\nThe next best thing here are the garlic knot sliders. Little orbs of meaty love is what I call them. Highly recommended.\n\nNever disappointed with the food here, and the staff is always friendly and service is fast.\n\nBy the way, for the at home chefs, you can buy dough and sauce here and give it a whirl at home. I've done it, not quite the same but close. Mostly because my GE oven doesn't quite compare to a commercial pizza oven...Still, worth a try."
0,"I was expecting something amazing from this restaurant, but I was sadly let down. I thought for the prices I would at least not leave hungry, but for $8.75 we got a portion of cheese curds fit only for a small child. My buffalo burger was good, but all of the unnecessary toppings coveted the flavor of the meat. The worst thing that we ordered was a mac and cheese with BBQ pork. The pork tasted like canned tuna and the sauce was beyond bland. I would not go back."

1,"Best service at the Gilbert/Germann intersection!  We go here all the time cuz we know the food and it's always good and the service is AWESOME.  Never have any problems.  Managers always come greet you and everyone is friendly.  They probably know us by now we come there so much, but always ask if we've been there before :D  Sweet tea's always cold, food's always hot and cooked right. Go for the Early Dine and everything is way cheaper!"
0,"I was not feeling overly energetic, so I wandered down to the food court of the casino to find something to take back to the room. I had not yet tried Earl of Sandwich so I gave it a try. The service started off poorly. I stood by the order area for some time before anyone even acknowledged I was there. After that they were reasonably friendly and helpful, but I almost walked away.\n\nOddly enough I did not order a sandwich. Instead I ordered the Baja Chicken Stuffed Potato. It comes with butter, sour cream, jalapenos and presumably chicken. I had asked for mine without the tomato that normally comes on it. My potato came out relatively quickly.\n\nThe potato had some good flavors. The jalapenos are a nice touch. The potato is good sized and filled me up. The issue with the potato was the complete lack of chicken. I am not sure there was any on it. I did not have it in me to go back down there to correct the issue.\n\nMy first experience here was lacking.  I will try Earl again, and will try a sandwich at that time."
1,"Very tasty and well made Beers. The house beers are your standard line up, where this place shines is in the seasonals and specialty beers. Some are OUTSTANDING!! The VIPA series offers up some very tasty IPA's, and the Chocoalte Cherry Stout is a must try. I recently had the Lemon Grass Kolsch and it was amazing. Very light and refreshing with a slight hint of citrus, and that earthy lemon grass flavor was subtle but still enough to really bring life to the beer. \nFood is good but not spectacular, but go for the BEER!!!"
1,"How you say YUM in Taiwanese? The food was very tasty, very flavourful and the ingredients  were very fresh.  A great selection of different varieties of main dishes and appetizers.  I loved that you could actually buy a half bottle of wine with dinner at a very reasonable price!  \n\nThe staff was very friendly and attentive and the pace of the meal was very relaxed and well timed.  The restaurant is located in the Plateau area of Montreal and even though it was a bit off the main strip, the place was busy the whole night.  \n\nMy only complaint that I would have to mention is that they charged you for parking in what looked like a auto repair shop that was closed for the night that was right across the street from the restaurant.  I figured that if you're spending what I thought was a decent amount of money for dinner, that even if they were being charged by the business, that they could spring for parking to make the experience 5 star worthy.  \n\nI'd still go back but might spend the extra minute or so to find a parking spot on the street."
1,"(Lyrics - Phil Collins - In The Air Tonight)\n\nI can taste it going to Bianco tonight, Bo Bites\nAnd I've been waiting for this location to open all my life, Bo Bites\nCan you taste going to Bianco tonight, Bo Bites, Bo Bites\n\nWell, if you told me you were hungry\nI would lend a hand\nI've seen your appetite before my friend\nBut I hope you know who I am\n\nWell, I was there and I saw what you did\nI saw it with my own two eyes\nSo you can wipe off your mouth\nI know what you've eaten\nIt's all been a plate of pies (pizza)\n\nCame here for a quick HH drinks with a buddy!\n\nHowever, when in Pizzeria Bianco you have to order a pizza!  It would be sacrilegious not to!  I'm not too fond of the draft selections since there were only 2, but I guess I shouldn't expect too much from a wine and pizza joint.  We ordered the Margarita Pizza.  Overall, it was pretty good - firewood baked pizza pie in a stone oven; you really can't beat that quality!  The aroma of the basil, the stringy mozzarella cheese, and the sweetness of the tomato sauce is enhanced by the toasty smell of the firewood! Yum!  \n\nThe service was very good!  There were several people that attended to us, but seem like they were all in sync and willing to help to make our experience so much better!  The place itself is different from the one downtown.  This one had more of a farm home feel with a touch of spring!  In the end, a must visit next time your around the Biltmore area! - Enjoy!"
0,"My husband and I were in Scottsdale for a business trip his company sent him on and, being a Cupcake Wars fan as well as a major lover of all things sweet, we decided to go into Sprinkles and get our cupcake on.  We were soooooo disappointed.  Between the two of us, we got Peanut Butter Chocolate, Dark Chocolate, Vanilla Chocolate, Pumpkin, Lemon Ginger, and Cinnamon.  Every single cupcake was dry and every frosting was overly sweet to the point of making us feel sick.  Mind you, we did not eat all of the cupcakes at the same time; we spread it out over the day.  However, both of us threw at least half of each cupcake away due to the dryness of the cake and the cloying sweetness of the icing.  A couple of the cupcakes had decorations on the top that were inedible.  Perhaps we weren't supposed to eat them, but on Cupcake Wars, Candace often admonishes a contestant when their decorations are not edible and so I am admonishing her store for doing the same thing.  I believe one must follow what they preach to others.  My husband wanted to give Sprinkles one star, but we compromised on two stars since the employees were so nice and friendly.  However, good customer service does not excuse the overwhelming sense of disappointment we felt at spending $3.50 (per cupcake) for what we think is some of the worst cupcakes we've ever had.  And that includes store-bought cupcakes.  I can honestly say that, at this time, we will not be returning to any of the Sprinkles locations."
0,"Rude staff, not very welcoming.  No hello, no thank you, dropped a dollar in the tip jar & didn't notice.  Should have put some coal in there.  Food was quite decent, definitely consider this healthy food.  I ordered the bbq chicken with quinoa, the portion was small and felt like there was an empty to-go container in my plastic bag.  A bit pricey for the lack of service and portion size.  Did I mention the service sucks?  Never going back, t madness is better"
0,"Ready, set, disappoint.\n\nT-Mobile, with whom I've been a loyal customer with for five years, sent me a used phone that had the previous users information on it.  That is a breach of trust from the previous owner.  To make matters worse, the previous owner had texted and emailed drug deals on the phone.  \n\nI ended up turning the phone over to the police so they could retrieve the illegal information off of it.  What was so upsetting is that T-Mobile didn't stand behind their product.  When I discussed the issue with customer service, the employee literally yelled at me on the phone.\n\nI ended up returning the phone after the police were done with it, and canceling my service.  T-Mobile actually wanted me to continue to use that phone, and are BILLING me for the service.  I closed the contract, which will cost me $564 to do so."
1,"I found the office to be quite lovely, up-to-date and \""new.\""  The staff, all the way from the front desk to the hygienist to Dr. Vander Schaaf to be very personable and friendly.  My teeth are very sensitive and I was quite nervous for my first in office teeth whitening.  My teeth really hurt after whitening with over-the-counter that I get at the store, and was therefore pleasantly surprised at how painless it was. Be prepared for it to take two hours, but well worth the time spent.  Very reasonably priced and just a lovely staff.  Would definitely recommend this office."
1,"Appetizer and happy hour deals are extremely good.  The Sushi combos are unimaginative.......but the rolls are good.\n\nThe ambiance is typical Phoenix....kinda boring.\n\nBut, overall, this place is worth going to."
0,"The customer service is ridiculous because the server has no service skill at all. I ordered a Pho special TO-GO, the soup and the meats are cold. I called to the restaurant, the server said she though I will eat it at home, so I can microwave it. She also mentioned  most of customers would do it that way. WT Pho... \""most of \"" is not equal \""all of \"", at least she needs to ask the customer first, before she put in the order."
0,"For $30 we ordered the fillet mignon special they were having for restaurant week. It was the toughest piece of meat I have ever eaten in a restaurant. The chicken drumstick appetizer was flavorless and tough. The salad was good and the Roquefort dressing, $1.59 extra, was very good.  The red velvet cake was a joke. It was 1/4 inch of cake with an inch and a half of whipped cream on top. I ordered a $8 glass of wine. It was servered warm. It took most of the meal for it to cool down to the temperature of the room. So many other places to spend less money and get a great meal."
0,"Let me preface this with:  If I could give less stars I would. \n\nMy teenage son had a booking to ride from Kingman, AZ to Phoenix, AZ yesterday. I prepaid and purchased his ticket online weeks ago. We got to the bus station early and we were told he couldn't ride without a notarized letter stating he could. NOWHERE on the site did I find this info, he couldn't board, and his trip was delayed a day. \n\nFast forward to today. We get to the depot at noon, which is 45 min early. Bus isn't there at 12:45 so we start calling the main office in Vegas. The idiot of a girl there answers the phone as if it's her own personal phone, doesn't even introduce herself or the company. We ask where the bus is and she puts us on hold for literally 11:30 minutes. I hang up, call back, and between her giggles she half-assed answers the phone.  After 5 minutes of holding she says \""the bus will be there at 2:10.\""  I asked why the bus is 90 minutes late and she just repeats herself. \n\nWe go home to burn some time after sitting at the depot for an hour, and come back at 1:55 and the bus is already there waiting.  The riders all look upset and the driver gets out and explains what's going on. Evidently the girl at the depot in Vegas never told him my son was on the manifest for today, so he drove through Kingman without stopping and was an hour past kingman on the way to Phoenix when she radioed and told him to come back for my son. You can imagine the anger of the passengers, all of which is now directed at my teenage son whom is - at this exact moment - riding for 3 1/2 hours to Phoenix with a bunch of angry strangers that are two hours later getting to their destination. \n\nFUCK YOU!\n\nSincerely,\n\nJason"
0,"Went with a large group and we each ordered something different to try things out. All of the entrees had a sweetness to them which wasn't good at all. It felt like I was dipping everything into honey. From the chicken, pork, bread, etc. this place just wasn't good at all. We didn't even bother trying out the desserts and when we received the bill we definitely made the wrong choice."
1,"I wish I could give them MORE than 5 stars!  They do ONE thing.  Chicken. and they do it BRILLIANTLY.  The Texas toast is amazing, I always end up stealing my husband's toast from his order.\n\nWhen I moved to Vegas from San Diego, I was sad at leaving Chic-Fil-A behind.  No longer does I haz a sad.  ;)\n\nStaff are friendly, cheerful and HELPFUL.  Place is always immaculate, and there's always at least one person in the lobby area busing tables and wiping things down.\n\nSweet Tea - don't pass it up, it's awesome.\n\nAnd to the one critical review I see below, may I say that if scads of people are saying it's great, and YOU happen to not agree... well perhaps it's YOUR perception that's off?  You mentioned being there late at night - perhaps your perceptions were \""chemically altered\""?  :)\n\nAnyway - amazing, amazing, and terrific.  Don't miss it!  :D"
0,"Horrible. Sub par job. Paid for a pedi and got lotion rubbed on my legs and bad paint job on my toes. The nail polish didn't even last a week, and the customer service was not great. The price was ridiculous for what they did."
1,"My first impression of the restaurant was that it was small. It is basically a square dining room. The decor and lighting were nice and the place was adequately clean.  For a Saturday night at 8pm, business wasn't booming, but it was dead either. The menu is large with mostly Americanized Thai dishes. Entree prices are reasonable, appetizers maybe a little high. Beer was little expensive too. A bottle of Kilt Lifter was $5. The service started out just OK. Our waiter wasn't very warm and seemed to have only limited knowledge of the menu. However, he kept my water filled and our food was delivered in a reasonable time. Portions are generous and the vegetables were fresh. I ordered a \""5\"" on my dish and was disappointed by the lack of spiciness. I got the eggplant with chicken. Overall, it was pretty good. One piece of the  eggplant was a little undercooked and the chicken tasted gamy, probably dark meat. I used a lot of soy sauce. I was very impressed with the brown rice - super fresh and sticky and some of the best I've had. My girlfriend got the shrimp salad, which she was very impressed with also. We didn't do any deserts or appetizers. We used a groupon and Its certainly not worth the drive from Scottsdale without one. Really, this is more a like a 3.5 star restaurant and if you live within a few miles - Thai Chili is a reasonable alternative for fresh food with a decent value."
1,"It all looks great! We tried a cinnamon roll (buttery frosting), a cannolli (rich!), a cheese Danish, and a bear claw (my favorite). No milk to drink was the only negative. Do your self a favor if you have a car and come visit here instead of staying on the strip."
1,"This was very good, best gelato, and much to choose.  The asian soup station was delish, and the latin station was very good.\n\nGet the 24 hour buffet pass, you won't be disappointed.  This is kind of spendy otherwise and less of a value.  I'm not a crab leg person, but was impressed by the giant heap of crab legs offerred - this had to be 4 feet wide and several feet tall.  Now that's nothing to be crabby about :)"
1,"OK so I'm not a big gelato connoisseur or anything. In fact, I don't actually know what makes it different from regular ice cream or what justifies making it more expensive. That said, I did try it here and it was good stuff. \n\nThe best part was the flavor options. There are a lot of them and I'm sure you can find something you like. The fruit ones also seemed to have real pieces of fruit in them and were very strong in flavor but not at all artificial tasting which was very nice. I myself had the coconut flavor and it was really good. Very creamy and thick (clearly not for anyone on a diet. I bet this stuff is made with pure fat) with actual coconut pieces mixed in. I really have no complaints other then, of course, the price. A small was something around $5 and while the portion was quite ample, I still didn't see why it was so much. It wasn't ridiculously expensive but still. I'm probably just being picky though and people who actually know about gelato will tell me that it's so much better then ice cream which is why it costs more. I personally couldn't really tell other then the more creamy texture.  \n\nIf you're in the mood for some refined flavors and very creamy ice cream  and don't mind paying more then you would for the regular stuff then I have no problem recommending this place. If however, you want some of the regular stuff for cheaper, go somewhere else."
1,"I LOVE that there is a drive-through at this location, although at 8:30am, I waited for what seemed like forever.  In reality though, it took about 20 minutes total, which I think is ridiculous for a drive through!  I got my normal fatty breakfast bagel sandwich, which consists of egg, cheese, turkey sausage, and cream cheese on an asiago bagel.  YUMMM....Also, Einsteins has pretty solid coffee.  $9 later, I was full and properly caffeneited and ready for the day!"
1,"2 for 1 Sushi, rolls and saketini in Mondays!!!  Good food regardless of the day of the week. We ordered our usual tuna filled delicacies and had a ball."
1,I ordered the Chinese chicken salad. It was really good and unlike any chicken salad I've ever had. The chicken was like sesame seed encrusted and it came in a bowl made if wonton. The calamari was also good. Not the best I've ever had but really good. I sampled the filet. Also great. Impeccable service but we went on a night the place was fairly empty. \n\nI also highly recommend trying the key lime martini.
1,"I walked here from the strip because I thought it would be an adventure, and it was!  \n\nGot to see some cool, and at times, strange live music\n\nAlso got to see the last band of the night get kicked out of the establishment\n\nStickers everywhere!"
0,"BE AWARE!! WORST SERVICE EVER!!\nI called them to make an appointment for an estimate of the cost. The appointment was set at 9 am, and at 9:20, their staff called me and told me they were about to come, so I waited at home until 12pm, and still no one showed up. \nAfter that, no one came nor explained to me anything, and I looked for other company for cleaning service."

0,"THE INTRO:\n--Despite my low two-star rating attributed to this restaurant, I would point out that it is a brand-new restaurant and they may be still working out some of the kinks.  I would consider this as you read my review.  We were at the restaurant for 2.5 hours.  My goal when deciding on a restaurant this evening was to dine with a couple (2) of friends that just wanted to have a nice sit-down meal to celebrate someone's birthday.  We ultimately chose this restaurant because it was new, had done some great marketing, and there was a lot of hype about the quality of the food, the d\u00e9cor and the location.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n--the d\u00e9cor is great - walls made out of solid concrete with a cool fireplace (it's not real fire, but very cool nonetheless), comfortable seats, a couple of wine cellars, soft lighting but still strong enough to see everything nicely, and a winding staircase going up to the second floor; and\n--the quality of the steak - it was cooked just the way I ordered (rare) and had a wonderful charcoal-tasting sear on the outside.  Contrary to another poster, the steak was not drenched in salt.\n\nTHE BAD:\n--speed of kitchen service - anything that we ordered from the kitchen (whether that was a snack, appetizer, main dish, or dessert) took a long time to arrive.  Excessively long.  We ordered a bottle of wine to accompany our main meal (we had had martinis with the snacks, etc., before the main meal).  The waitress brought over the bottle (Penfolds Bin 9) immediately after the main meal was ordered and, amazingly, we managed to finish off the bottle of wine before the steak arrived!  We didn't \""chug\"" back the wine, either: we took our time.  Service was equally slow for the starters\n--I feel bad saying this, but our waitress just didn't seem to fit in this calibre of restaurant--there was just something about her service that was a little \""off\"" by the comments that she made to us during the meal and her general demeanor came off as a bit \""brusque\"";\n--the quality of the starters - we ordered smoked cheese fritters and Japanese dumplings.  The dumplings were warm, not hot.  The quality was only okay.  Unfortunately, in a place like this, \""okay\"" doesn't cut it.  You'll see why in the next line; and\n--the quality / quantity / price ratios (le rapport qualit\u00e9-prix) - the bill came out to $100 / person but the size of the dishes (quantity) and the taste of the food (quality - except for the steak which was great) just didn't justify the price, and that's taking into consideration the nice d\u00e9cor."
0,"The cold weather was killing my battery performance.  Like the car is sputtering and the battery does not have enough juice to turn the engine on.  I felt so helpless with the prospect of potentially being stranded somewhere or not being able to get to work.  So I ordered a replacement battery, and decided to head to Walmart and have their auto service department install the battery for $10 (that's what their website stated as one of the services offered).\n\nSo with a really deep saving on a premium battery I ordered online, I drove to Walmart Supercenter.  But the auto service department said they don't install batteries unless it was purchased from Walmart.  WTF?  Do I need to print out the Walmart webite and show you what services you do offer?\n\nAnyway, nothing was done, so I did the dirty work myself and saved the $10.\n\nNot a happy camper, but getting your hands dirty and doing something on your own is noticeably rewarding.  Not looking forward to it, but I know I can do it if I wanted to.\n\n2 stars!"
1,Ask For Christina! I was able to get an appointment at the Walk In Salon same day on a Saturday Afternoon. They are open everyday and makes it worthwhile to visit. She did a great modern mens cut. I booked my next appointment post cut right away.\n\nThe atmosphere is modern but not too flashy or too uncomfortable. The stations seem to be a little tight if it was all full. The wash station is one of the most comfortable ones I have experienced.\n\nThis location is easy to get to. I parked at Mandalay Bay self parking.
1,Awesome vet and grooming salon! They don't over charge or try to charge you for everything little thing. They're very patient with our dogs and it's clear that they actually care and have a passion for animals. Never a long wait time or anything to complain about. The grooming service is great as well... Much cheaper than other places and our dogs come out smelling and feeling nice and clean. Will definitely go back.
0,"We have been here a total of about 4-5 times and its went from OK to not so good. Just had cold hard shell tacos with an \""off\"" taste, chips that were thick with salsa that tasted from Sam's Club. blah. tamales were OK. Habaneros is MUCH better."
0,"Went here on a Friday night with my fiance on 4/12 for drinks at around 5:30 PM and noticed upon entering that the pub was empty. We were seated by the hostess at a table where the sun blinded us, so we decided to move to a table right behind where we were placed. After about 10 minutes, we had still not been acknowledged by a server so I went back to the hostess and asked her if we could have someone take our orders. After another 5 minutes, our orders were finally taken. The food was decent but the service was absolute crap so I left her a dollar tip."
1,"Came with my girlfriend for a few nights. Really nothing bad I can say about this place. It's pricey but definitely impressive and high quality, and I'd say we had a good time.\n\nGood: \n-Everything from the shops, to the rooms to the day and night club says chic modern opulence.\n-Good customer service, I had no real qualms with anything. All staff was friendly and gregarious. I had an issue with the TV and they sent someone up right away. One of the minibar sensors was broken, and when I called to have the charge removed, they comped me the 375ml bottle of grey goose!\n-Not sure if this is for all rooms, but the junior suite I had came with a connectivity panel with audio jacks, USB ports, etc. that connected into the room's tv/audio--something that is lacking in most hotels I've stayed at. The TV also had satellite radio! Lets you keep beats bumping all day!\n--Parking and valet is included in the ~$25 daily resort fee (I think this true of all vegas hotels though)\n\nBad:\n-Takes awhile for bellman to bring your bags up, and pick them up when you're all set.\n-the ATMs in the hotel have a $6 service charge, on top of your bank's ATM fees, so don't rely on them if you don't have to.\n-Marquee Day Club was probably the least fun of all the beach clubs I've been to (Daylight, Surrender, Tao). The attendees and bartenders just seemed douchier than the vegas average. Worst of all, this pool boy would constantly stalk around the pool yelling at people with drinks to move to the edge of the pool. He would go so far as to wade into the pool to yell at people that weren't paying attention to him, kicking them out if they ignored him too many times or gave him attitude. Total buzz kill. I'd dock points for their club but this is a review for the hotel so...\n\n\nSide Note:\nIt's owned by Marriott, and this property gives pretty sweet perks to their members, so if you're platinum I really don't see any reason to stay anywhere else in Vegas.\n--Your own exclusive check-in room that skips the line (I was in the regular check in line but somehow the front desk guy knew and led me to the platinum members room, woohoo for feeling important when you're on vacation.\n--Choice of 500 pts or free lunch buffet for two at the Wicked Spoon.\n--use of platinum member lines\n--complimentary upgrades if available"
1,"Excellent meal and great service. Diver scallops were the best I ever had. Black cod was good, but a little pricey."
0,"Park anywhere else but here. Tth Street Ripoff.\n\nComplete ripoff and they charge the maximum daily rate regardless of how long you actually park there. I asked the lot \""cashier\"" to do the math on how much 90 minutes cost at $2.00/20 minutes and he just kept pointing at the sign, telling me it was $14 in broken English.  Ridiculous.  He just kept pointing and saying over and over , \""14, 14 dollars.\""  \n\nNever again.  Walk a few more steps and park at one of the $6 surface lots all day for less than half the cost."
0,"Horrible. Just plain horrible. Like the other review, get one star cause I have to. Ordered a small chili with cheese. Asked for some chili sauce packets on the side. A spicy chicken sandwich combo with a side of ranch. The wifey was nice enough to get it in the first place, so I can't complain to her. No ranch. No chili sauce. No spoon to eat the chili. No straw for the drink. No napkins to wipe hands with. Did get ketchup for the fries, but didn't eat them because they were colder than the ice in my drink. I was soooooo angry I actually called. The manager offered to give me the stuff if I drove down and pick up the items. There was no mention of a refund or a gift card for a future order. Doesn't matter because I won't be going back."
1,It's popular for a reason!  Green chile is excellent.
0,"Had great expectations for this place. My wife loves tenders and she was not impressed. $24 for lunch and although the cole slaw was fresh it was vinegar based which taste sour. The fries were tasty but we hate shoestring fries, reminds us of Shake & Steak. Service was great though. Wanted to try fried banana pudding but $5! Played loud country music also, which we not fond of. Hubee D's please try harder"
1,"I've eaten at this place two times.  First time, food was good and service was great.  Second time....OMG!\nWent there with a $30 Groupon with a friend.  First off, the waited didn't speak but a few words of English.  Are you kidding?  \nWe finally get the order straight with our no hable Ingles friend, the waiter, which, by the way, took some time.  But we weren't in a hurry and it was ok.\nFood was surprisingly okay again.  No complaints there.\nThen we get the bill:  $27.63 on the bill.  We give him the $30 Groupon which more than covers it plus a $5 tip.\nHe comes back with another BILL for the balance of $2.37 and stands there.  Being engrossed in a conversation, we didn't get why he was standing there WAITING FOR MORE MONEY when we should have gotten more back.  Finally my friend gives him another $2 just to get rid of him.\nFor gosh sakes, Rancho Papa Chulo, hire someone who speaks some English at least.  \nI'd give the food really a B+ cause it was pretty darn good both times, but the service the second time was really an F+.\nJust for clarification:  1st time I ate there I had the fajitas, 2nd time I had the quesodillas with fajita meat."
1,Classic.. audience was great too!
1,"Despite not being much of a \""sandwich eater\"", I've always been a fan of Goodcents. Not because I think they're sandwiches are any better than Quizno's or their decor any more aesthetically pleasing than Subway's, but because they're the most honest sub shop I've ever come across.\n\nEven though sandwiches can be good for you, you don't see some asshole running around with a sandwich board that reads \""MR. GOODCENTS SUBS WILL MAKE YOU SKINNY! OH...AND THE END IS NEAR!\"" And even though they cut their own meat, you don't hear them advertising this one particular aspect of their business at every opportunity.\n\nOMG A FUCKING TOASTER? YOU CAN TOAST SUBS! OH MY GOD THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER? IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN USUAL SUB SHOPS BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE IT'S TOASTED, IT'S BETTER AND MORE FILLING! TOASTED'S THE WAY OF THE FUTURE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\n\nThey make sandwiches. That's really all there is to it. \n\nThey keep their bread in giant plastic bags because although it's unappetizing looking, it actually preserves the freshness, as opposed to keeping bread stored in a hot, humid cabinet just above the oven where it will begin to absorb the taste of the bread it's crammed up against (Yeah, I got your fucking number, Subway). \n\nThey cut their meat and cheese fresh because that's actually what you're supposed to do, rather than pre-slice it and pre-package it so it can stew in its own juices while it gets shipped out to the nearest chain location (My Ultimately Worthless Factoids-2, Subway-0).\n\nThey're subs might be healthy, but probably not. Judging by the large number of heavy-set people (including myself) who frequent Mr. Goodcents, I think it's safe to say that all that meat and cheese probably isn't doing our hearts any favors. But then again I know people who only order the salads at McDonald's or the veggie at Subway who'd make a dietitian piss themselves and faint. \n\nThe last couple of times I've been to Goodcents I admittedly had no interest in purchasing their sandwiches. The diuretics I'm on right now force everything out of me, so I've currently been on an all-soup diet. A bowl of ramen or a cup of Campbell's Soup At Hand contains both the water I need and the sodium to help me retain said water. \n\nGoodcents has, for a sandwich shop, amazing soups and pastas. The chicken noodle itself is worth a visit or two, as is there chicken alfredo or pasta salad. \n\nPlagued with the flu, I stumbled in last Wednesday with a few bucks in my pocket and a craving for something hot and liquid to sip slowly. While my friend was harassing one of the girls at the counter (what guy sees a girl putting meat through a cutter and goes \""yes, she seems like a suitable mate\""?), I gave another  my order.\n\n\""Chiggen soup, please. A half.\""\n\""Just a half? Are you sure? You sound like you need it.\""\n\""Just a half's fine.\""\n\""Tough. I gave you a full. You sound sick.\""\n\""Oggay. Thagg you.\""\n\""You're a student, right? Show her (the cashier) your student ID and you'll get a free drink. You need all the fluids.\""\n\""Yeah. Tell me about it. Thagg you zo much.\""\n\""Don't mention it.\""\n\nLater that day, while my co-workers were arguing Subway vs Quiznos and discussing what should and should not go on a meatball sub, I sat quietly, sipping at my chicken noodle soup and lemonade, thinking that I could get use to this 'flu' thing.\n\nOh, I couldn't fit this into a clever phrase but the soup comes with a side of buttery bread. It's amazing. You wouldn't think that buttery bread and chicken soup went together, but a few years ago you probably sat there in front of your TV and said \""Toasted subs? Yeah, that's a passing fancy if I ever saw it.\""\n\nYou know what I've been looking for? A deli that makes good PB&J sandwiches. Anyone who can bring me this information will be given my secret recipe for the ultimate bloody mary."
1,"Even if you have been to a Bashas'markets Inc before, you must go to this one! You could spend hours here, eat dinner, have a drink, and shop. Obviously the groceries can be pricier, but that's expected if you go in the first place. Expect to spend an additional 10-15% but probably worth it."
1,"Huge selection of Quebec beer, good prices, knowledgable staff. Always a great place to wander the aisles and pick up a few interesting beers. They also sell glasses, shirts, and hot sauce made with beer for the beer fanatic in your life.  \n\nJust a word of warning though - if you're looking for American craft beer, or even craft beer from the rest of Canada, you won't be able to find it here. Nor will you be able to find it anywhere in this province."
0,"Don't get me wrong, for the ASU community, it serves pho that will suffice and pass for pho but if you have a car and can go elsewhere, go elsewhere.  Don't get this place mixed up with the OTHER Pho Nhat located on Southern and Dobson across the street from MCC.  That other place is AWESOME.\n\nTHIS  place is all about mis-hits and complete misses.  I've come here and have had pho which is ok and other times when the broth is so laden with salt and msg that I feel suicidal 4 hours later.  I really hate giving out 2 stars to an establishment but the pho I tried here recently really made me feel ill hours after I ate it and I would be doing all my fellow Yelpers a disservice if I didn't say anything.  \n\nThe good: clean establishment, close to ASU, huge playful Disney characters painted on the wall that reference BBQ even though it's a pho house, lots of parking, tall ceiling and you don't feel claustrophobic inside.\n\nThe bad: somewhat salty/msg laden broth, small basil leaves.\n\nThere aren't many \""bads\"" but that broth was so bad it almost had me sawing away at my wrists with anything that was sharp.  I felt bloated yet dehydrated at the same time.  My eyes were super dry, the joints in my hands swollen, my mouth parched...  this place unfortunately deserves the 2 star rating of \""Meh, I've experienced better.\""  I almost gave it a one star rating but I've had stuff in the past that was decent so it gets another star.\n\nIf you're feeling lucky, go check it out.  If you have the best pho of your life, try to extend that luck and buy a lottery ticket."
1,I just moved in the neighborhood and don't have my laundry room set up yet. I went here to wash my bed sheets and it was a pretty typical laundromat. The woman working was very friendly and helpful (telling me the best machines to use for what I was doing)
0,"My experience here made me create a yelp account.  Starting with the positives - plenty of space and seating available, overall friendly staff, and affordable options on the menu.  On the flip side I felt the food portions and attention to detail were subpar.  \n\nFood portions - There are three different sizes of pho on the menu - small, large, and xl.  Being as hungry as I was I ordered the xl.  The waitress showed up with a big bowl of broth.  Never in my life have I finished eating a bowl (let alone an xl) of pho still feeling hungry.  \n\nThe details - when I received my check, it was unclear as to whether I was supposed to pay at the table or pay at the register.  I sat around unnecessarily for a while...they certainly could have explained that better.  When I went to pay, they said they did not accept American Express although the sticker on the door said Amex.  When I questioned them about the sticker on the door they said they forgot to scratch it off...but still asked for a different form of payment.\n\nI wanted to like this restaurant but unfortunately it was the small food portions and lack of detail (and the fact they don't accept Amex) that makes me not want to go back here.  When you don't pay attention to the details on the floor who knows what goes on in the kitchen."
1,"Stopped by for lunch on a gloomy Tuesday and the place was pretty empty (think we caught the end of the lunch crowd). To begin with, this place is hard to find. If you knew the previous establishments that were here, you will be just fine, but if you don't- make sure you have your google maps app out! \n\nThe decor is beautiful, inside and out. We chose to sit inside, and you just don't feel like you are in Phoenix. Everything was orderly and clean, and it was just beautiful. Did I mention that it was beautiful? Good.\n\nGot to chatting with the bartender and manager, both of whom's names I have forgotten. Sorry! However, they both were very, very nice. The bartender made us some delicious Moscow Mules (THANK YOU for putting bitters in them!!), and we ordered the veggie burger and hummus to share. They split our burger for us, which was very gracious of them. The food was delicious, delicious, delicious. It may have been all of the mayo and cheese on the veggie burger that made it so tasty, but who really cares. The burger itself was perfect! \n\nThe manager filled us in a bit on some neighborhood problems, and to that I say- THRIVE ON Vig Fillmore, thrive on!! The neighborhood needs you, and they will come to love you!"
0,"Overall, my pedicure was fine.  But a word of advice: if a customer requests nail art, and you cannot do it, please just be honest.  The nail tech asked me how I liked her \""art\"" and I was honest with her and said I didn't really care for it.  I wasn't rude about it, but I didn't want to just suck it up.  She got totally offended and started talking to herself out loud (in another language), but she didn't re-do it.  So in the end, I sucked it up.  I'm so frustrated.  And now I need to find another salon to get a new polish.  Sans nail art, which makes me sad because I really love it when it's done well.  Come on, Vegas!!!  You're better than this!!!"
1,"Trader Joe's is the best chain grocery store ever. I'm hooked on their grape tomatoes, organic baby salad mix, extra firm tofu, Salsa Autentica, and many more products. This location is under renovation, so I'm not sure if that's the reason they don't carry a few of my favorites from other locations, such as the baked blue corn tortilla chips. \n\nThe staff is always friendly, and the prices are hard to beat."
0,I love Hampton Inn but this location is in serious need of remodeling and some deep cleaning. Musty smell everywhere.
1,The best enchilada style burrito I have ever had. \n\nIf you catch them on a day they are making tacos... you are in for a treat. \n\nshort and sweet :)
1,"This is Emerill Lagasse's restaurant so you know its going to be great!  The bartender \""mixologist\"" here is award winning and has been featured in national magazines.  The mojito is out of this world.  UNBELIEVEABLE!    We had the waiter recommend dishes and they were dead on.  We had an outstanding food experience.  The combinations were different but not crazy.  The server will guide you to all the best.  This literally brought my husband to tears. Two exactly.  One for the mojito and one for the marispalla dessert."
0,"We are locals who decided to stay at Arizona Charlie's Decatur due to a problem with our air conditioning. We checked into the hotel and went to the room. The first thing that popped into my head was the old hotel commercial that talked about \""the room that time forgot\"". The furniture had to be at least 35-40 years old. Then I started looking around. Stains on the carpet (that looked almost as old as the furniture) and chairs that looked like they had never been cleaned. I went to the front desk and told them about the dirty room, and they offered me an upgraded room. I took the key and went up to check it out: Even dirtier than the room we were already in. We checked out without spending a single night.\n\nIf there is a plus to this place, the employees at the front desk are friendly and they try to be helpful. They earned this place the one star it got from me. However, no amount of friendliness or trying can overcome the glaring deficiencies. Very possibly the dirtiest hotel I have ever been in.\n\nHere's hoping for a surprise Health Department inspection."
0,"Grossly understaffed. Waited 2 hours. While waiting for a table, we saw a half drank Gatorade bottle in the ice container where they would get ice for the cocktails. At one point the bartender scooped the container up with the ice and just moved it to the side and proceeded to scoop more ice from the same spot to make someone's drink.  Food wasn't worth the money and it was cold by the time we got silverware and napkins."
0,"Food was cold, shrimp not properly cooked through, workers seemed to be uninterested in service, I suppose you get what you pay for though!"
1,"Don't just drive past this place! Yes, it looks like your average fast-food-joint-converted-into-Mexican-taco-stand. From the outside.\n\nGo in and you are first greeted by the staff who smile and say hi as they bustle through their food prep (they're also filling drive-thru orders). And you look around--the place has charm. They've put in their own furniture--kind of modified benches/tables that feel like a comfier upgraded fast food set-up. There's some decor, the place has a feel, maybe even some plants. Your senses tell you this is NOT just a taco joint or fast food.  And take a look into the kitchen, which is all open for you to check out. It's shiny, clean and fresh-looking. You're excited about what will come out of there.\n\nI had told my friends that, according to Yelp, the tacos were huge. The guy behind the counter was fixing one up. He saw us staring and held it up for us. He saw the awe in our faces. He smiled and said, 'Half pound of meat.\"" \n\nWe got a variety of tacos in our party  (each of us only needed one). It comes half wrapped in paper like an In&Out burger, and it's good that it does. It's thick and full of juicy stuff piling out the back. I chose the carne asada--pretty awesome. My friends liked the agua frescas, too.\n\nI wish I had a taco joint like this near where I live. I'd make it my regular go-to. The food is lightning fast, but I'd even be tempted to hang out a little."
1,"I brought my chihuahua puppy here today for a wash and day care. I was nervous about leaving my little buddy all day but I thought I'd give it a try so he can learn some social skills.  Lori and her husband were so nice!  I called around noon to make sure he was doing ok and they told me that I could watch him on their live webcam. I got to watch him run around and make new friends while I was at work. When I picked him up this evening he was happy and smelled fresh and clean. They even sent him home with a cute little box of treats and a coupon for $5 off my next visit. My little bro had a blast and their prices are so good,  I will definitely be bringing him back for another play day."
0,"In Montreal on vacation with my partner. We are both gluten free so were excited to hear about the buckwheat crepe option. When we went to order we were told that they didn't have any more buckwheat crepe batter (unsure if they meant for today or just don't have it anymore). Ordered some scrambled egg fusion dish instead... in my mind it should be hard to mess up scrambled eggs but they were gross, could only eat a few bites. \nThe service was also awful... Aside from taking our order and bringing us our food the server did not check on us at all. Never refilled our coffee despite refilling coffee at tables next to us. Took FOREVER to get our bill. Overall this place was a flop and I wouldn't recommend it."
1,"Service is always on point. They're fast, friendly, and funny.\n\nEating here before the Adele concert was a savior because I really didn't feel like eating at a higher end restaurant at Cosmo. Just something easy and nothing formal.\n\nI had their tenderloin rossini which were sliders with tenderloin, foie gras, and mushrooms. Meat was bigger than the buns. Super juicy. And I could taste the foie but, couldn't see it. I was dissappointed with that cause when I'm eating foie, disgusting as it may sound, I like to see the fat coming out of it.\n\nPizza rolls were like those pizza bites but, I'd rather have pizza bites. lol"
1,"If I could live anywhere in Vegas this would be the spot. It has everything needed to have a good time and than some. \n\nEvery inch of the building is beautiful, swanky and funky all at the same time. With pink chandeliers, modern decor and cool furniture. \n\nOur room was one of the best rooms I have stayed in. I slept better here than I do at home. I melted in the huge comfy feather soft bedding. The shower and tub were incredible. I love the CO Bigelow products that are supplied. I hate trying to use soap that feels like a cheap bar of wax.\n\nThe TV was command central for the lights, music, checking out the amenities and even making restaurant reservations for the places in the hotel. Anything your heart desires can be done through a remote, it is crazy! \n\nThe employees overall were nice and accommodating. The female that checked us in was professional and friendly.  The bell desk fellas were fast and asked about our stay. They also said to let them know if our shuttle didn't arrive that they would help us get to the airport. They gave me the \""warm and fuzzy\"" feelings = great customer service. \n\nMany different types of restaurants, shops, oh and don't forget Wicked Spoon (it is a must) to stuff your belly. \n\nYeah it's a cool spot. Thanks Cosmo for showing me the good life for a few days. Now, I'm back home a little fatter and poorer dreaming of my return."
0,"Ordered lunch for the 2nd time.  The first time it was okay - good enough to go back but what a disappointment today.  Greek salad loaded with cheap Feta cheese that was very hard and way over-used.  The lettuce was all Iceburg and mostly the hard white stalks rather than leaves.  Very little flavor to the dressing, could see no oregano and the garlic bread was greasy.  Co-worker was uninspired by the chicken fingers with soggy fries.  They included a free cheese pizza but it was greasy and also uninspired.  The sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce.   We won't be ordering again."
0,"We have visited Bally's many times over the last 40 years.  It is definitely time to tear this one down and start over.  Other than a perfect location there is nothing to recommend it.  Rooms are old and run down, breakfast buffet for 11.95 did not include coffee of juice and consisted of one very short line of nothing really special.  So $32.00 later I would recommend just getting a bagel.  The on line check out did not work so I could not view my bill without standing in line again with all the people who were checking in when I am checking out.  I am having to call and fight to get one because my charges don't look right at all.  They charge $3.00 per day for use of the in-room safe of you can believe it.  Was told the daily resort fee included the Internet connection but the instructions were so bad I had to go to the front desk for an explanation.  By that time I didn't really need it I just waited until I got outside to use my phone.  The resort fee is a joke because the Spa is so far away from the South Tower who on earth would want to wander through the Casino to get there.  I know everyone charges one so why don't they just include it as part of the cost of the room I ask?  The dealers were mostly friendly but blackjack games were somewhat limited and the show was good but there are much, much better hotels there for not so much more money.  My husband and I really stayed for the tennis courts but next time we will stay at Caesars and walk across the street.  Unless you are just young kids out to drink with your buddies and don't care I recommend you pass on this one."
1,Super friendly owner and instructors!! Great group of ladies!! Love it here and feel very supported!
1,"This is my boyfriend's and I favorite place to eat at in vegas, I know that there are other high end fancy spancy places but for some reason we always have so much fun coming here, we usually have dinner her about 6pm and have never waited in line, and we always ALWAYS order the same thing, Ribs, and Buffalo wings, One of the best wings, and ribs we have ever had. super good we both eat and get full for only about $40. We never order drinks her cause we always go in with our own fat tuesday margaritas. We love this place we are going to vegas in November and will have dinner once again here for sure, Ribs and Hot wings. ps. rack of ribs is huge thats why we always share it. comes with some delicious fries very seasoned!!!!"
0,"Maybe the worst cap ever. First of all they only serve capp's for in house. Not to go. Then they only serve them in a proper coffee cup, 6 oz. I can drink that in one gulp. They agreed to put it in a big cup for me but I told them I did NOT want a Latte, which is what they wanted to sell me. If you can serve a latte in a to go cup, why not a cap? \nThe cap was, in fact, like a latte and it was awful. The coffee tasted stale and there was no froth on the milk\nGet your fix at the Starbucks before you head down to gate C"
1,"Banh Mi - Vietnamese sub sandwiches, via French baguette (yum!)\n\nPlace - small, tight, only two tables for seating area. If you need a place to sit and eat your sandwiches, you can sit on the bench, outside the shop by the non operable water, by the fountain. \n\nFood - the banh mi #11 is good (steam pork meat). This time, I got #12 which is the same as #11, but longer, almost a foot. I normally don't like p\u00e2t\u00e9, but with my Vietnamese sandwich, I had to have with it.  It just enhances the flavor of the sandwich, with their beurre (lard) --yummm!! They do a good job with the sandwiches here, it brings me close to home in Houston. \n\nService - they can be quick as can be. The only gripe I have is that they do not take sugar cane orders, 30 minutes before closing!  I thought they close at 6:30pm, but the hours now is that they close at 6:00pm daily. Cash only, no exceptions -- had to go to an ATM."
1,"The Capital Grille in Phoenix has the best steaks I have ever tasted. You will never be disappointed when going here, whether it's for a special occasion or just for dinner. You can't go wrong when you go here. It doesn't matter if you like steak or not, this place will make it your favorite food. Their impressive menu of nationally renowned dry aged steaks and the freshest of seafood will ignite your culinary imagination as their award-winning wine list of more than 5,000 bottles awakens your inner sommelier. I can never think about steaks the same again after eating here, the best by far is the Kona crusted sirloin. I have never heard of it before but wow was it amazing. Great cut of meat and the sauce was to die for. The French onion soup was great, very light. The soup didn't really grab my attention until I got home and was craving it. Every side dish I had was also great, the mashed potatoes were by far the best; they were hot, cheesy, and just wonderful. I never even though about putting salt or pepper on anything. Everything was perfectly seasoned and amazing. I never have really liked coconut cream pie but I enjoyed this one, so moist and creamy. The cr\u00e8me brulee was a little rich but the fresh fruit they put on top made it much better. Dinner ran about 60 dollars a person not including the wine. It was by far one of the most expensive meals that I have had but it was well worth it and I will most likely be going back. The service is customarily outstanding and the staff's wine and food knowledge is exceedingly above board. The waiters were well dressed and were well spoken. It was great not to have some ditsy waitress for once! No matter what questions you have regarding the restaurant they know it all. The decor is just what I expect from an old school traditional steakhouse, dark wood, cigar humidor, and oil paintings. It not overwhelming and it has this sort of calming effect. It is so much quieter than other restaurants, people talk in a low voice so you can actually hear what your waiter is saying. Everything was very clean; I don't think I could find a piece of old food anywhere if I tried. I would definitely dress a little nicer than you would at other restaurants. They don't care if you just show up in jeans and a tee-shirt but you will definitely stand out. When I went it was a surprise and wow was I underdressed. I felt so out of place and like I didn't belong. I wouldn't recommend this place to bring your children, so I would get a babysitter. You don't want your fantastic meal ruined by screaming children. For larger parties, they have a conference room in a secluded, closed off area. Whether you are having a business meeting or just a party, it is perfect for any occasion. Reservations are not need except for Friday and Saturday nights; don't expect to even see a table on these days without one. On a crowded night parking is a nightmare, I would recommend that you either make reservations really early, really late, or use the valet that they have. I wouldn't recommend going here if it is last minute because you will be waiting for a long time. The American Culinary Federation recently bestowed upon The Capital Grille the \""Achievement of Excellence Award.\"" The Arizona Republic said the dry-aged steaks are, \""gloriously beefy and juicy, lightly seasoned and utterly delicious.\"" You cant get a review like that if you are just any restaurant, they earned that award for sure. The only part that wasn't one hundred percent to my liking was the temperature that my steak came out. It was perfectly cooked but it wasn't that warm when I got it. It seemed like they had it out on the counter waiting for the other part of the meal, but that was the only thing that didn't meet my standards which is very good for a restaurant. I would highly recommend The Capital Grille to anyone wishing a special dining experience. The place is a little pricy but great places like this should be and believe me, it is money well spent. Best steaks, appetizers, soups, and desserts. Why go anywhere else?"
0,"No!!  Don't do it!  \n\nThis is my second review on this particular merchant.  They were previously located at 1455 W. Chandler Blvd Ste B-11 inside of the Bellagio Clinic.  They promised that the move to their own facility would enable them to provide better service.  Not at all...\n\nApparently, if you are a male and have an accent, certain staff does not wish to be pleasant or provide even the most basic customer service, let alone treatment.  Let's just say my husband has had a truly horrible experience with this place.  To the point of being prejudicial, but that is his story to tell...\n\nI've really tried to give this place a second chance after the last experience I had.  They swore up and down that that was not how they normally operate and that the move (another 10 miles out of my way, now totally 20 from my home) would only allow them to improve service as they would no longer be restriced by working in a physician's office.\n\nHere is what I know:\n\nIt's impossible to get scheduled within a reasonable amount of time.  They are either under staffed, overbooked or both.\n\nIt's impossible to speak to someone who is not a child.  Seriously, they all are just out of high school.  They can't answer simple questions and they are all sitting around texting or looking at Facebook on their cell phones.\n\nThere is never any management on site.  How is this even permitted by their corporate office?\n\nThe website says \""Our staff includes a certified esthetician, a registered nurse, a nurse practitioner, and a full time board certified medical doctor\"".  Not true.  No one is in the office except for the very young and unsupervised Laser Technicians.  \n\nYou cannot call them directly.  You must call the 800 number to ask questions about anything.  Even to ask driving directions when you cannot locate the new office and there is no signage to help you find the place.  \n\nThey have tip jars in the rooms.  Really?! Tip jars??!  Is this Starbucks?  This to me is completely tacky.  I have been in the service/hospitably/spa industry for over ten years and I have NEVER seen nor would even ever ALLOW a tip jar to be placed in a treatment room with a HUGE sign stating that tips are appreciated!  Of course they are - but don't make me uncomfortable and feel obligated to leave one - especially when the service is so very poor.\n\nTo submit a complaint, you must fill out a form online and wait for a call.  I did just that and received a call the next day from what I assume to be the location manager.  She left a voice mail.  I've been trying to call her back for three days.  It goes straight to voice mail.  I've left a voice mail but still no return call.\n\nOver it and getting all of my money back from Groupon..."
1,"I've been going here since I was 12. I practically grew up here. There was a patch of time where it lost a lot of popularity. But great skate is back now. Filled with people every Friday and Saturday. The best lighting system, the best employees, the funnest environment and DEFINITELY the best sound system in arizona.

1,"There seems to be some kind of misconception, I believe, that British food is \""bland,\"" or otherwise lacking in flavor.  While that may be true in the UK, it certainly isn't the case, here.\n\nI don't get over to this place as much as I would like, and that's MY loss, because every time I dine here, I'm never disappointed.  In fact, a fraternal/social group to which I belong, used to meet here every Friday night, about 10+ years ago.  We had most of the upstairs section to ourselves.\n\nI can recommend almost everything on the menu, as at one time or another, I've sampled most of the fare offered.  I treated a total of 5 of my good friends there on June 13, 2012, and the total price for all 6 of us was under $100, so their charges are certainly reasonable.\n\nBut best of all, if I may be permtted a totally MALE observation, I definitely noticed the delightfully (and incredibly) SHORT Scottish kilts being worn by the female servers.\n\nNo joking guys, they all have LEGS TO DIE FOR."
0,"Stayed here in the spa suite for three nights. At first glance it looks swanky, but after spending half an hour in the room, you start to notice all these little \""quirks\"":\n-Sit on the toilet to pee and discover that the toilet paper is 5 FEET AWAY FROM THE TOILET. You have to get off the toilet, dribbling yourself with pee if you want any TP.\n-A lamp was placed in a dark corner of the room, went to switch it on to discover it is not plugged in. Went to plug it in to discover there is no wall socket anywhere remotely close. The only other available plug was on the other side of the wall. And there was one in the bathroom. Thought about calling downstairs and asking for an electrician to be sent up.\n-Hot tub in room sounds better than it really is.  Just makes for a humid room.\n-Lampshades were all crooked and in one case, not even attached, which I just figure is sloppy housecleaning. \n\nNot luxury. But not horrible. If I didn't get a good rate on my room through AmEx, I would have been pissed."
0,"Extremely disappointed and very angry dog owner today! I took my dog here recently for his 3rd and Final visit. My first 2 visits were great, but the last one lost my faith for good on their unprofessional and uncaring service.\n\nI have a Frenchie with a very sensitive stomach. In the multiple page application they have you fill out I mention that, as well as advised them that the cause of his stomach ailments is rawhide treats. In fact I put on his application that he is ALLERGIC to rawhides and mentioned not to give it to him because he gets bad diarrhea. So when I took him the last time, my dog apparently threw a \""temper tantrum\"" which usually means he squeals  really loud when you crate him. I advised the owner of this and she assured me they get that all the time and they can handle it. Well let me tell you how they \""handled\"" it. Yup, to quiet him up, they gave him a rawhide treat which he swallowed whole. When the handler that day told me that I was extremely upset. And rightfully so because tonight my poor guy is suffering from awful diarrhea. He is not as active and constantly having to go. \n\nWhat compounded matters more is the gal at the desk was looking over my paperwork to see where I mentioned rawhide and she couldn't find out. I advised her that the paperwork she was reading wasn't mine, and then she laughed it off when she realized her mistake and thought it read wrong because the documents described a cat's history. I was already so angry that they did not read my paperwork, but she was so unskilled to realize the difference between a cat and a dog. I had to point out her error, opposed to her not figuring out that my dog was not abandoned by a cat like the paperwork said. Ugh!!!! When I first visited I was also advised that I shouldn't worry about treats because rawhide is not one of them. Well guess what, it is. \n\nIf you take your dog here, make sure they read your documents. Go over everything with them and mention your dogs issues, otherwise you'll end up like me staying up to take care and clean up after your sick puppy."
0,Prices are STUPID. God forbid you order a Sam Adams Double Agent Seasonal beer - it's $7.00. Yes. $7 for one pint of a beer that is $8.00 for a six pack at any store. Total bullshit.
1,"Our experience at Mesa Grill was wonderful. We started with the smoked chicken tacos for my husband and the chicken and black bean quesadilla for me. Hubby loved the spicy BBQ sauce on his tacos. We thought the portions were big and could have easily shared either of them. A selection of bread was offered before the meal.\n\nFor entrees, I got the pork tenderloin and hubby got the filet. He said it was perfect and ate every bite. We are big steak eaters so we know a good (and bad) steak when we see one. The pork was delicious and perfectly cooked to medium, but the ancho-chile sauce was a little spicy for me. The only disappointment we had was we were too full for dessert.\n\nService was great and the pace was nice, we never felt rushed even though the restaurant was very crowded on a Saturday night. The hostesses were not rude or crabby, just very busy. The cocktails were very strong--had to have hubby finish mine for me.  Hubby can't wait to go back to Vegas just to eat here again."
0,"This was my first visit here but was craving pancakes! I usually make my own from scratch but today, didn't feel like it. Normally, when I do go out for pancakes I go to Perkins but I left later than planned and Pancake Caf\u00e9 is closer.\n\nWell, first of all I was not greeted when I walked in and waited about 2-3 minutes before a hostess came over to greet me. She was not the friendliest person I've ever met--especially to be a hostess. My server however was very friendly and efficient. However the pancakes, I did NOT like! They were way to sweet and that was without the syrup! To me, they truly had the taste of cake made with yellow cake mix that was made into the shape of a pancake. It needed frosting instead of syrup! The texture was also different--a little rubbery and a tad bit on the dry side. (By the way, I had the buttermilk pancakes). The fresh squeezed OJ was not that great either--tasted like they the oranges they use are the best. Didn't really taste like fresh squeezed to me.\n\nWould I eat there again? Maybe I would try an egg dish or omelet but NEVER pancakes again! When I go out for Pancakes, I will stick with Perkins as I think theirs are delicious!"
0,"Ordered the Aged Rib Eye and was almost uneatable, It had no taste and consisity of a NY, the wine I had to send back. never go there again"
1,"Oh In-N-Out. How I miss you so. But for now, I will just cherish the moments when I regularly had a grilled cheese with animal style fries and a milkshake. The next time I'm in Vegas, we will be reunited and it will be a beautiful thing."
0,"This is the place to drink.....and thats about it.\n\nDisappointed with this place althoughI wasn't expecting a ton.  Looked like a nice beer selection with pretty decent prices so I probably should have just sticked to that.\n\nI ordered a salad (bar and salad usually dont mix i know) but I thought what the heck.  The salad was average at best and at $13 I would have expected a lot more.  The other stuff on the menu might be better, but I'm in no hurry to find out.  \n\nOverall, looks like a good place to booze and watch the game and in the grand scheme of things, thats not a bad deal."
1,"Many people do not realise the significance of the name 'Last Drop' for a pub. While most suggest that the name referes to the last drop of your drink - few seem to realsie the significance associated with the Hangmans Gallows. Pubs named the 'Last Drop' were often the last pub before the gallows and provided the customary final drink before the condemmed was hung until dead - the metaphorical 'last drop'.\n\nAnyway, History lesson aside - the Last Drop Tavern is a well situated traditional Scottish pub in the heart of the Grass market. While tourists can become an annoying feature of the Last Drop, it is more often than not simply a great place to relax and enjoy a large selection of whiskys, ales and other drinks with abit of pub grub thrown in for good measure. What more could you ask for?\n\nAs a special treat - the bathrooms are painted with chalk board style paint and coloured chalks are provided - a great way to keep graffiti down, but also a hilariuos communication tool. \n\nThe LAst Drop is a good place for a drink and some Haggis - but tourists can become a bit annoying."
1,"Had a great week in Vegas BABY, and the Wynn Theater was great. We took in a show, similar to Cirque Soleil but not as good.The seats at the Wynn are comfortable and roomy. The sound very good, and special effects amazing. \nI'd go back to see another show at the Wynn."
0,"Nice selection of cars, pretty good pick-up/ drop-off and some great staff but BEWARE of one of the ladies on front desk which can take away all the good in a sec. She will try to squeeze as much money to give you a car of your choice. If you are using corporate rate, she will try her hardest not to honor any of the decent upgrade options or even make it impossible by dis-allowing certain cars from the category you are trying to upgrade! With what authority I don't know!!!\n\nAgain it is only one & I won't hesitate to steer clear next time after the 3rd consecutive experience. And sorry won't take the name so can't help much there but here is some advice: Do not hesitate to call the manager if you encounter similar experience.  She might even lie that the manager just left for the day but obviously somebody is in charge every time and mostly more responsible so highly likely you will be heard. No other reason this facility will deserve anything less than 4 stars."
0,"Vincents has lost a customer for good...\nI have eaten there at the location 3 times and picked up to-go 2 times. Of the 3 times I have eaten there in Vincents, two of the times the order taker forgot to put in my order..The first time my whole family sat there for about 45 minutes and when I inquired about my order the girl at the register admitted that she forgot to put in the order for our pizza pie.I chalked it up to her being ditzy and I was not happy,but we waited Finally after more than an hour and very little apology we got our food.,  and then enjoyed our meal in despite of the lousy service. \n \nNow the other day the same thing happened to me. I told the girl who took my order that this was the second time they have done this to me and I was treated with indifference.I was offered 3 slices that were siting at the counter instead of my whole pie that I ordered, I said I would wait for the pizza I ordered and then I did. If I had not have paid already I would have walked out.You would think that they would have came over and offered something but they didn't until I guess my dirty looks propelled her to bring over a plate of free Garlic Knots. I do like the taste of the pizza but I will never ever step foot in there again with service like that good luck to them if they were in NY nobody would go there!!~!..I suggest if you want NY/NJ East Coast pizza make the drive to Grimaldi's(The best!!!) or check out the local Bella Italia in Ahwatukee over by Brilliant Sky Toy Store. \""Mangia!\"""

1,"Such a fun downtown spot. Doesn't feel like you're in Las Vegas at all! They have an excellent selection of wine/beer/cocktails and very reasonably priced. Crab rangoons are some of the best I've ever had, perfect cream cheese/crab ratio. Shrimp Pad Thai was a little too heavy on the cilantro for our liking, it really overpowered the dish. There weren't enough peanuts either. Also tried the Garlic Fried Rice with Tofu which was incredible. Spice level 2 was perfect for both of these dishes. Can't wait to go back and try more items!"
1,"Great food at good prices. Excellent decor, it's definitely unique. Awesome coffee for you java lovers."
1,"Just moved to Phoenix from Southern California and while exploring the area stumbled on Five Guys.  I was excited because I have friends in Philly that tout this place.  We headed over at about 2 to let the lunch rush die down--we only had 3 people in front of us but the restaurant was about 75% full.  \n\nI ordered the cheeseburger and DH got the bacon cheese burger both \""all the way\"".  We each got a small order of fries, mine regular his cajun style.  We were #68, so we got our drinks, sat down and waited (opted out of getting peanuts).  It took less the 5 minutes for our food to be up and boy am I glad we didn't get peanuts.  \n\nThe burgers were double pattied with sauted shrooms, onions, pickles, lettuce, tomatoe and ketchup and mustard.  The french fries came in small cups but there were at least that many at the bottom of the bag too....no way we would eat all of those.  Next time 1 small order.  I now also understand what a \""little\"" burger is on the menu, it must be one pattie.\n\nThe burgers were good, sloppy with all that stuff, but really good flavor.  Glad they were wrapped in foil so I had something to hold it all together with.  The fries were done in peanut oil (I assume).  Not cripsy but I don't think they were supposed to be.  They were good, but the cajun was a bit much.  \n\nThe price was reasonable just $20 for two big burgers, 2 fries and 2 drinks.  Will definitely go again."
1,"WOW!  This is the nicest bowling alley that I have ever seen!!!  I was attending a birthday party in the plush couch area.  It was a blast!  80s music vidoes showing, food is flowing, and people are bowling.  FUN!  Clean, great service, and decent food for a bowling alley.  \n\nAfter bowling we headed to the game room.  The interactive games are fun..."
1,"I'm giving a 5 for service.  I actually stopped by the outside after going to the Dollar Tree to check out their menu.  A very nice woman came out and talked to me about the food and place, saying it's good and healthy.\n\nI told her we lived in the SE valley in Gilbert and that it was far.  I was only here with my husband for his interview and I would ask him if he wanted to come here for lunch when I go pick him up. She told me they have lunch specials until 3 pm.\n\nI convinced my husband to come after his interview to eat here, as I love this type of food and they also had Russian food.  When we got there, there was only one table of people, then us.  A little after we got there, there was another couple that came.\n\nSo the restaurant wasn't busy and if there was a lunch rush, it was over because it was probably 2:30 pm.  My husband ordered a Beef Gyro pita and I ordered a Beef Shwarma.  \n\nThis is where it was a bit strange.  It took awhile to get the food and it did not come in a manner we expected.  Oh, we ordered off the lunch menu, so for $7.99, you got a can of soda (we chose Pepsi), lentil soup, and either a salad or fries.  So, not a bad deal and reasonably priced.  I did want to try some Russian food, but that would have been too much food to eat for just the two of us.\n\nSo my husband's Beef Gyro Pita comes out first.  Odd that the soup & salad didn't come out.  We waited and after awhile, she brought my salad.  The pita came in a basket, but it was definitely too big to eat by hand and we asked for a large dinner plate to put the pita on and my husband ate with a fork & knife.  The tzatziki sauce for the gyro was a lot and very heavy, creamy, not something I am used to.  Could have had less sauce and a little more meat.  The meat did taste good, though.\n\nSo I ate the salad while my husband started to eat his gyro.  Then the lentil soup came out and my husband liked that because it reminded him of Colombia.  He liked that soup better than the Chinese soups.  Okay.  But, the soup wasn't really hot, which would have been nice rather than somewhat cooled.\n\nMy husband and I pushed aside our food to have the soup, then continued with the salad and gyro afterwards.  Then we waited for awhile and by this time, I'm sure it was more than a half an hour that we placed the order that my Beef Schwarma came out.  It wasn't a lot of meat, more vegetables, like my husband's gyro.  There was a lot of garlic sauce on it, which was fine.  The pita that I had seemed like it was hard and not soft like my husband's.  \n\nI tried to eat it like a pita sandwich, but the pita literally broke.  It didn't tear ,but broke.  This means they either heated it up too much and left it to sit and get hard or they didn't heat it at all.  The meat was very tough, like they used the toughest cut of meat, like the chuck part.  I had to chew so much and there were a couple pieces that were just not palatable.\n\nI don't know if the lunch rush got all the good beef, but I was kind of not real happy that the pita broke, the sauce ran all over my hands and I used a lot of napkins to clean my hands, and that the meat was incredibly tough.  \n\nThe fries came when I was part way through my schwarma.  The fries were good and the touch of dill made them flavorful.  These looked homemade and were delish.\n\nSo, service I give a 5 star, but the food, I give a 3 star.   If we're in the area, we might give it another try.  I love going to family owned businesses when I can and maybe the cook was on break or who knows what happened."
0,"I've been here twice, probably won't be a third time.  Both times, the wait times here were really bad and the service is lackluster.  My entree really sucked the 2nd time I went, too."
1,"Stayed here a few times and we loved it. It's been nicely remodeled, ultra clean and very well maintained. The front desk staff is a little snippy but housekeeping is eager to help and very nice."
0,"We had a coupon and was craving steak so we went here. Let's start with at 6pm on a Saturday it was empty but for an older group. The decor would make you think you where at grandmas house. The place was dark and was not very inviting. We decided to share the filet and I wanted it rare it was raw cold and fatty. I know they are not a high end place but it was just cheap. Chewy and tasted like it was thrown in a broiler. They offered to bring something else, so I had potato soup and it was bland, boring, and lacking anything that would make me want to come back."
1,"After three days or so of being bedridden sick, and unable to eat solid food, Mineo's was my first solid food meal.  Wise? Not really, no.  Probably should have had toast or jello or something.  But hopped up on meds and ravenously hungry, the idea of what some call \""Pittsburgh's best\"" pizza-wise was a siren calling to me from afar.  Dangerous, but irresistible.\n\nI ended up having no trouble eating it, actually, so I got lucky there. \n\nIs this the best pizza I've ever had? No.  Was it pretty good? Yep!\n\nThe cheese was laid on a bit thick for my tastes, but other than that it was pretty delicious.  I really didn't see what was terribly remarkable about it, though.  To me, it was a decent pizza, but not a reason to celebrate.  \n\nSo that's my take on this Squirrel Hill staple.  'Tain't bad, but 'tain't life-changing, either."
0,"THE GOOD:\n\n-Walkable distance from most of the main downtown hotel casinos & just a block away from Bonneville Transit Center if you want to bus it from The Strip. \n\n-Interesting menu variety that has something for everyone. So much so that it makes you want to try everything on the menu.\n\n-Was not crowded on a weekday which was when I visited. Very odd for a place with such high review marks.\n\n-Server was very courteous and friendly.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n-While walkable if coming from the direction of The Plaza Hotel along Main Street, the neighborhood is very sketchy and does not feel safe even in broad daylight. And from what I can tell while riding on the SDX, even the walk from Bonneville Transit Center looks hazardous to pedestrians so you may have to walk a very long walk to avoid getting hit by cars.\n\n-I had the misfortunate experience of an apparent lost order where it was not \""relayed\"" to the kitchen which could mean any number of things. Waiting 35 minutes for your meal to arrive can do a number of things to your imagination. Who screwed up? It sure sounded like the server blamed it on their computer system. What the heck does \""relayed\"" mean? Does it mean it got punched into the system and the send button wasn't hit? Whatever. \n\n-The manager came by to apologize for the wait. Even asked me if there was something he can do for me. I'm not one to ask for anything complimentary so what can I do but shrug? Not a single piece of appeasement or discount was had or offered to make up for it so it made his apology sound insincere. Why are you asking me how to do your job? It only made me more angry and upset.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n\n-In an attempt to bring everything out at once as suggested by my server, and to add insult to injury, my grilled cheese sandwich was cold. No ways would I wait another 30 minutes for them to make a new one. In hindsight I should have asked them to remove it from my bill.\n\n-An overall horribly disappointing experience. But don't let my obvious fluke and lapse in service stop you from trying this place out. I even posted pictures since it seems apparent every other reviewer loves this place. I'm just not one of them."
1,"My wife and I decided to visit Cafe Aroma again. We hoped like our visit this time around would be a similar experience. We weren't dissapointed.\n\nThis place is a rarity in these times. By that I mean it is family run. On this visit we had the pleasure of meeting the owners Arlin & Nickie. They were very pleasant & friendly. \n\nAs far as breakfast goes, I'm not a big fan and normally I don't get breakfast at a restaurant because somehow most places I go to botch it up. Thank goodness this spot is not one to follow suite. \n\nFirst off I want to say our server Monik she was friendly and attentive and totally on top of things and kept popping back to check on water levels, coffee refills, etc. \n\nMy wife feels that a good breakfast needs good coffee and their coffee passed her test.  She ordered the THE CLASSIC which was 2 eggs over medium, sausage links-patties, with a side of their Buttermilk Biscuits smothered with homemade sausage gravy. My wife said her eggs was cooked to perfection. By her satisfied expression, she reveled in the goodness of her choices made at breakfast. \n\nAs for me I'm not a foodie. But I like good food, I know what I like and there's plenty here. I ordered the 2X4 (2 eggs over easy, 2 strips of Bacon, 2 sausage links, 2 Buttermilk Pancakes with a side order of cornbeef hash). I loved the pancakes - great consistency and flavor - and the perfect size. \n\nOne last thing on Sunday they have a Variety Show featuring local talent from 12-close. My wife and I stayed for the show. First up was Dr. Lawrence Stern of Arizona Eyecare followed by the Red Sky Esemble. The avergae age of the group was 16. They were very entertaining, talented young men. So if you have a special musical talent like original monologues, comedy routine, poetry, singing, dancing, playing an instrument acting talent ect. then show it off. Consider auditioning for the Variety Show at Cafe Aroma. For more info please contact Cafe Aroma @ 623-551-1500 \n\nFOOD: The food taste more homemade, Reminds me of an old town restaurant. They made sure you did not go home un-satisfied and hungry. SERVICE: Like our last visit the way service should be. Friendly and warm. CONCLUSION: Cafe Aroma is the best kept secret around. Everything from breakfast to lunch to their Sunday Variety Show ... One word: AMAZING. So go here. Seriously, just do it. Don't think about it, Just go."
0,One of the crappiest pizza I ever had in my life along with the worst service I ever had in Vegas... won't go 0 stars because system doesn't accept.
0,They always take about 2 days and have ruined 3 of my husband's very expensive dress shirts and of course refused to take responsibility for it. Luckily Macy's was kind enough to replace even though it wasn't their fault at all. They had a different excuse each time for why it wasn't their fault
0,"As the saying goes:  I've got 99 problems.  Unfortunately the flavor and heat level at Fiesta ain't even close to being one.  FC was so crowded that ye olde boy friend and I  held out hope for a Mexican experience that would put the culinary and GI horror that was El Toro out of mind.  We're still waiting for the GI results, but at this point I think we're ready to call it:  unless you want to be depressed and wallow in milquetoast mexican food, don't go here.  The ambience was fine.  It was bright and kitschy in ways I find endearing.  \n\nGetting the order wrong and forgetting a side?  Forgivable.  \nRuining tequila with a syrupy excuse of a marguerita? bad news.  \nSwapping the meats on my BFs platter? worse news.  \nUnflavorful and rubbery fish tacos smothered in soggy slaw and served on a plate where everything was white:  death.  \nA soggy fry job on a cimichanga: death warmed over.  \n\nI feel like mexican food is easy to get right:  it is my go-to for home meals when I have nothing on hand.  With beans, cheese, lime juice, salt, something in the pepper family, a tomato and a tortilla -- it is easy to be great.  If you start there and possible add cumin then there is nothing you can do wrong.  I'd be happy to assist FC if they would like to develop this concept.  Until then, I'll just be over here soaking some beans and making my delicious oyster mushroom fajitas."
0,"This place gets 2 stars because of its proximity to DT Chandler and the staff was pretty nice. That's about all that's good.  We had a work party there and the food was pretty good. But the rooms are not so nice.  Had a funky smell and the bed sheets, we noticed when we woke up the next day, were not clean. So that was disturbing.  I mean the place isn't terrible but I don't think I'll stay again unless I absolutely have to."
0,"With free entree coupon in hand we decided to check out Dilworth Neighborhood Grille. After all, we live in Dilworth and it's always fun to try a new place. The space is attractive and has a lot of seating, with a large bar area and lots of TVs for superior sports watching. Service was also pleasant and prompt. Unfortunately the food we tried (other than the house salad, which was fresh and good) was nothing special. The slaw on the BBQ platter was not very flavorful and the BBQ itself didn't have any kind of smoky appeal. The mac & cheese was OK but not great. As for the shrimp and grits, to me it was way too cheesy/greasy- some may like all the cheese but definitely too rich for my taste and not enough distinct grits flavor separate from the sauce/cheese. This would be a fun place to watch a game and definitely good for the drinking set. Of course I only tried a few items from the menu, but from what I tasted the food is not the draw here."
0,"Walking down the isle with my brand new tailored suit, with rips under both arms says a lot.  then going in the store and being yelled at by a guy with his finger in your face is a whole other level of customer service that I do no t appreciate.\nUpon my return visit he was much more apologetic, but he never refunded my money.  Instead he offered me a deal on another suit."
0,"What?! The Palazzo not receiving a 4-5 star rating?!? That's correct...I should have trusted some of the older reviews on here and steered clear of this shit hole...ok ok maybe that's a bit on the harsh side, but this \""luxury\"" hotel definitely did not come close to meeting my standards. I booked the Bella Suite for two nights on a weekend. First thing that I noticed when walking in was the overly pungent smell of a 65 year old grandma being pumped through the air vents at seemingly toxic levels. The odor Would have been pleasant if it was about 10x more subtle...rather than hijacking your senses and making you feel a bit lightheaded. Check in was a breeze however and the guy gave us a comp \""upgrade\"" to a room with a \""view\"". This entitled us to a view of the TI pirate show and the Palazzo pool...which would have been decent except the fact that the view was completely obscured by quite possibly the dirtiest window I have ever seen in my life. If I actually paid the $45 upgrade charge, I would have been furious. I much rather would have taken the standard view of the Wynn instead. The next thing that I noticed was the mass amount of dust build up on the sofa and shelves above the bed..yuck and achoo. Also, there were numerous nicks and scuffs on almost every piece of furniture and wood...even an imprint of an old dirty orange left on the counter top. To top that off there was a Condom in the seat in front of the bed, it was still in the wrapper but..Really?? Did No one even wipe/clean/inspect this place? Next observation was the most ill-placed wet bar/snack bar ever created. It is so inconveniently placed... you Cannot move it or touch it or even Look at it without getting charged some ridiculous fee...which I did. Right about this time is where I started to notice perhaps the worst quality about this dump, the Air. It is sooo dry and stale that it actually made me uncomfortable and unable to sleep well. If you are at All sensitive to this kind of thing, I highly recommend you do not torture yourself with this terrible air quality. I do realize that most hotels are a Bit on the dry side, but this was at another level...You couldn't even turn off the \""fan\"" if you wanted to...the AC yes, but the \""fan\"" no. I even had to put a towel over the vent to provide just a bit of relief. The Roman Drapes were sort of cool although they were dusty and the remote for them was very weak..this was probably due to the fact that the batteries in them were almost completely corroded with battery acid. The bathroom was pretty nice and spacious although I don't understand why they don't put a fan in the closed off room where the toilet is...the T.V. was cool in there though. I ordered two separate things from the front desk, towels and extra drinking glasses..and both times the service was incredibly slow...taking at least 45 minutes for each. And then there is the bed...the mattress was fairly comfortable but the sheets were stiff, especially the pillows. I would highly recommend bringing your own pillows as they were very stiff and uncomfortable...in fact I'm not even sure if they washed the pillow cases as there were some random eyelashes and small hairs on them. Also, the lighting system is weird with the lights and switches in odd/annoying places. There is also a resort fee that is supposed to cover local calls (who Really uses this..) unlimited Internet (nothing like going on vacation to use the web) and a daily newspaper...that we Never got Once! The casino was OK...$15 minimum on all tables which is expected I suppose. Had decent luck there but would much rather gamble at some other place. Overall this place was just not worth it. For around the same price I will Definitely be staying at the wynn/encore on my next trip. Beware of staying at The Palazzo!"

0,"I am a Vegas local and have stayed here on two previous occasions.  Both times were with Groupon/Living Social deals and I was very happy.\n\nFast forward to a month ago when I purchased another Groupon for a Spa package and hotel stay.  \n\nThe first time I called to book a date, I was told their reservation system was down and that a Supervisor would call me back the following day.  No call back.  I tried again a few days later and was told that they did not have the correct codes to book the Groupon.  I was also told a Supervisor would call me back.  No call back.  I again tried a few days later and was the told the same thing.  They did not have the correct Groupon codes to make a reservation?????   I was again told a Manager would be contacting me immediately.  A Manager did not call.\n\nMy next call was to Groupon.  I was immediately refunded my Groupon purchase and told that others had experienced problems as well.\n\nBuyer beware.  Not sure what is going on here.  A shame really considering it is a really nice Hotel."
0,"While this is the largest LV store in the U.S. and the most beautiful and well-stocked, it is my least favorite of the LV stores that I have been in.\n\nThe sales staff is aloof and inattentive. Yes, my husband and I may not look the part of typical LV shoppers, but that does not mean that we are not ready to shop - way to lose a potential sale.\n\nThe lady who showed me the bag that I was interested in warmed up slightly when she saw my genuine interest, but I not enough to make me want to shop here.\n\nWhen we went into the men's department and elsewhere in the store, we were completely ignored. Not cool at all. We ended up making our purchases at the LV store at the Bellagio instead."
0,"We just moved here from the Midwest and have been staying with my daughter in her apartment in Mesa while we wait to move into our house. I was recommend by a friend who knew the receptionist that worked there. \n\nWe have a 21 month old pure bred collie who just had all his shots before we came to this area! He caught a virus from the dog park at the apartment complex. They never called me back with his fecal exam test results! I paid at the time of our dogs appoint for prescription dog food and two prescriptions for him. I got for prescription at the appointment. They said they would call me when the prescription dog food and the second prescription came into their office for me to come and pick up. They never called! I called. I went and picked up the dog food. Five days later the second RX still never came in and still no phone calls from them even though I was calling them . Finally, I called and asked for my money back from the second RX that I never received. They even sent me a postcard saying my collie need his shots after I gave them his records from our vet back home. We found another Vet in Chandler who we are much happier with who calls us back, has the prescriptions in stock. Gilbert Veterninary Hospital called me and wanted to know if I had requested them to get my pets records from their clinic. I just told them yes? You would think they would get a clue on how they treated me and my pet! Some people really treat their animals as part of their families and you don't take their care lightly! I'm glad this wasn't a child but it was my child with four furry paws! I think that are out just to make money here and just want to rack on the charges! The other vet also told me my Rocky could keep getting this and told me how to prevent it. Where Gilbert was telling me if it happened again that it would require additional testing and was probably colitis! I found out the virus was going around between the other dogs in the apartment complex!"
1,"Very cute local art Boutique with tons of interesting artsy creations. I really enjoyed walking through the store and looking at everything. So many great ideas, and cool crafts to buy for decorating or gifting. I loved the vibe of the location, which is surrounded by small local stores in downtown Phoenix. Loved it and will definitely be back."
0,"I really wanted to give this place a better review...I mean its my people...I'm from an island culture, this is supposed to be an island inspired spot, but is was the service that stood out to me...\n\nThe food is good but not great...Loco Moco, good, but its not that hard to make and for 8.25, thats a little pricey for that dish. The Adobo Fried rice is good, but similar to a lot of Filipino Adobo at any other Filipino Restaurant and again is pricey. Also, the portions are very average. Its a ten to 12 dollar meal that doesn't really fill you up like island food can, so bring a bag of chips or get ice cream on  the way home  Eggs benedict are good and there are a lot of different styles of it so that cool to try. Red Velvet pancakes are good if you really have a sweet tooth. $4 dollars for three strips of o-k tasting bacon....oh no.....\n\nThe service, its a little slow...its gets really crowded, and the servers can be pretty smug...Half of the servers are really hospitable and the other half seem annoyed. We were a big group and we waited about an hour...\nMy friends Waffles came out so late, that he asked to cancel them...for Waffles....there explanation was that the waffle machine wasn't working correctly and they wanted to make them just right...He cancelled but they still gave it him when our meal was basically done, and they still charged him...really...and they were just O-K.....\n\nI love the ideas in this restaurant, but I expected way more and have had way better food, at a better price with better service.  It was Island style Las Vegas food...."
1,"WOO-HOO! I LOVE the Fillmore!\nPros:\nThe sound is AMAZING! I've been to two Ben Folds shows here & have been blown away by how good everything sounds!\nI've never had any issues with the staff.\nShow times - start on time.\nStaggered viewing area, so it's not all level where you're having to stare only at people's heads.\n\nCons:\nI like the layout; however, the \""general admission - standing room only\"" gets me, because \""you snooze, you lose\"". If you don't get there early, you're stuck waaaaay in the back. Parking is an issue, too. You have to compete with all the other establishments there, so when it's time to go, you're stuck there for a while trying to leave.\nTicket prices - UGH. I can't stand this whole convenience fee mess. Just charge one price & be done. :D"
0,"I would rather be punched in the face, than eat anything from this Cook on Wok location."
0,"Mexican food should not be served buffet style, it just doesn't do it service.\nThis place isn't even traditional buffet, you don't serve yourself, per say.\n\nThat said, this is not Mexican food. Imagine Taco Bell trying to open a sit down Mexican restaurant and then doing a worse job than you would expect. That place would still be better than Pancho's. The only thing I even kind of liked there were the sopapias (or is it sopapillas?).\n\nIf you like canned nacho cheese, frozen tamales and diabetes, eat at Pancho's."
1,I not to fond of sushi and I'm rating this 5 stars. I usually avoid the roll and go for the nigiri like Super White Tuna and Cajun Tuna which are my top 2 favorites and they just melt instead of being all plasticky and chewy. Also did I say that Sushi is one of my least favorite food and I'm giving this 5 stars?\n\nThis review is base on the food alone not the service. If the old Asian lady isn't serving you most likely you going to get okay service or less.
0,"Let me first say, the environment was great, the staff was cordial, and the food decent.  I'm giving only 2 stars for, quite frankly, one main reason: the food took a very long time to make.  Our entire dinner took 2 hours and the first hour was waiting for the food.  The place was busy but not filled so quite frankly, there should be no reason for this inconvenience.  I will come here again and give them a second chance because our meals were good and I look forward to having their specially made sushi selection.  It just won't be for a very long time because they need to figure out how to manage the staff first.  We have a sushi place we LOVE (Tomo's) so H's has a lot to live up to.\n\nThe Environment.  You can do hibachi, hang at the bar or have a sit down.  The environment is pretty foo-foo and definitely restauarant-y and not some hole-in-a-wall.  Probably a good date place but there were families there, too.\n\nThe staff.  They were initially out of menus and hubby and I had to share.  Luckily, the hostess was able to snag another one but that was our first impression.  Not a good one.  Well, our first impression was actually having to wait for almost 10 minutes to be seated when there were obviously plenty of empty tables, just not enough staff.  Our waitress was very apologetic b'c of the long wait and constantly asked us if we needed anything.  I'd rather have that than be ignored but she probably could have toned it down a bit.  Actions speak more than words and for the time we had to wait for our food, they really should have given us a discount instead of just saying \""I'm sorry\"" 20 times.\n\nThe food.  We were in the mood for cooked food so we got the Bento A and B - salmon (a) and beef (b).  It came with rice, tempura, shumai, miso soup, and salad.  Mine also came with a california roll and hubby's came with 4 pieces of sushi.  The salad, soup, and main meal all came at the same time because of the backup which really sucked.  The breading on the tempura didn't taste \""light\"" like a tempura should taste (you know what I'm talking about - the difference you get between calling it a tempura or basically just fried shrimp).  The rest of the food was pretty good.  Miso soup tasted lighter than most places which I loved.  I've had better california roll but it does pass muster.\n\nThe menu.  There was a pretty good variety of stuff there between hot and sushi.  They had some interesting sushi selections that I'd like to try next time but just didn't feel like having that day.  Our meals came with the basics and hubby commented on the 4 sushi pieces he had with his Bento A meal \""It was OK but I have had better.\""  I didn't try his so I can't comment.  I liked their California roll that came with my dish (but I have had better).  They have descriptions of the various rolls (which most places that cater to Americans do) so that will be helpful in your decision-making.\n\nIf you're testing this place out, I would visit when it's not peak hours.  It's definitely worth a shot.  It just wasn't worth the time (i.e. long wait)."
0,Wow. Where do I start. The place looks great. A lot of big tvs with multiple games pkaying. Great selection on beer and spirits.  Thats the only positive.  I had Daniella as a server. She took my order and brought it to my table. Thats about it. I needed condiments for my dry burger. Waited 20 min (just to see if she would check up on me). Nothing. She walked by me multiple times without any check up. I drank my beer and wanted another. Had to go to the bar to get 1. Horrible service.  Bad food. Cool place (only reason they got 1 star)
0,Did not enjoy this place at all.  Wine was severed in water glasses.   Appetizers and main course had no flavor(how do you mess up pasta).  Food was cold. They warmed up food and it just dried out the meal.  Very disappointing.
0,"awful.  mini suite room - more expensive no couch room was run down.  shower controls didn't work.  hair dyer broken. iron - ridiculous \""no steal\"" coil made it impossible to use.  windows so dirty you couldn't see through them . room service got a simple one entree order wrong. no tea avaialble, not to mention there was no tray to put the coffee, tea, creamer on ---- in the bathroom. GROSS   would NEVER stay here again and I am pretty easy to please.  NASTY  NASTY NASTY"
0,"Well, now I know why people don't usually put french fries in their sandwiches. Sandwich comes out huge and kind of dry, and you can't taste the meat at all."
0,"I DO NOT WANT TO EVEN GIVE ANY STARS....This is the worst Walgreen's in Las Vegas!!! The staff is completely rude. The head pharmacist actually told me to doctor shop other physicians. The male head pharmacist thinks because doctorate in pharmaceuticals that he could obtain my private medical records without a signed release form. THAT'S COMPLETELY ILLEGAL. SO DO NOT LET THEM BULLY YOU INTO GIVING OUT YOUR PRIVATE MEDICAL RECORDS. They are just pharmacists and that does not equate to years of medical school. I will never go back there, he threatened and violated my rights. I don't want what happened to me to happen to any one else. DO NOT GO THERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE INSULTED, VIOLATED AND THREATENED."
1,"Even if you don't grab a bite to eat here, you should stop for the shakes.  Either with alcohol or without.  They have some damn fine shakes.  I loved the s'mores one.  ugh. omg. delicious."
0,If I could give this place no stars I would. Roll very small for the price. The miso was awful.
1,"Vanity is located inside the Hard Rock Casino.\n\nWe had a good time at Vanity, although our review may be biased since we did have a table and gained easy entry through DJ Zhaldee (thanks Z!) I liked the dancefloor layout. The crowd is a good mix of beautiful people of various ethnicities. Staff is friendly. Deejays off-da-hook for sure! \n\nOn the night we went, a lot of smiles on clubgoers faces. No drama or muggin'. All good vibes! \n\nIf you're looking for a fun atmosphere with good music and good vibes, I recommend Vanity. If you're looking for the L.A. glitz and glamor environment, you're better off heading to Encore.\n\nWe had a great time at Vanity! Would go back again for sure."
0,"SIGH! Ok..I'm a foodie that has eaten all over the country.  Appetizer of Calamari was good. Salad. Good.  Dinner...Filet, exceptable...Lobster tail..inexcusable.  No resturant of this level should serve seafood grossly overcooked.  The meat would not pull away from the shell.  Extremely chewy.  So much for a good anniversary dinner. Skip Ruth's Chris and go two blocks over to Flemings.  Dessert..chocolate sponge cake with ice cream. Service was excellent but food was not.  Will not waste time and money here again."
0,"Nothings changed here. Walked up to order breakfast, and the \""manager\"" and crew members just ignored me. Guess why? They were discussing how to increase sales! Priceless."
1,When I first arrived at Firefly I didn't see the signs for parking in the rear so I thought it was really empty.  I parked in the rear and had to walk past the dumpster with a man rummaging through it.  \n\nI sat at the bar.  The redheaded server was very sweet and know her menu items.  I was especially impressed when she told me what looked good out of the kitchen that night.\nI started with the Salmon Toasts.  They had very good flavors but tasted very similar to bagel and loxs(should have listened to the waitress).\nThe second dish I ordered was the shrimp Diablo.  The sauce was a perfect mix of spicy and sweet.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly.  \nThe third dish I ordered was the lamb chops.  They too were delicious.  I would not recommend them if you're in a large party.  \nOverall the food was good.  The service was great.  One critique would be the presentation of the dishes.  They could have made them look a little better with the small plates.
1,"Go here for everything we need.  It's clean, well stocked and the employees are nice.  The deli is amazing!  Prices are right there with the other places....but I love the fuel discounts and I can't pass them up.   Love the bakery!"
1,The Chichen Tacos were outstanding!  The staff are always friendly and  are quick with our meal.   Good Food and Good Service makes for a good timer out!  If only these guys could cook Asian food!  We don't have a good Asian place to eat at here in Southern Highlands!
1,"Best veggie burger ever! You can't beat the $3 drafts on Tuesdays either. The staff is awesome and make sure you all of they have specials, they come up with some ridiculous burgers."
1,"Cheba hut is great, the atmosphere, the food, the music, and did i mention the FOOD ?? This sub shop is anything but ordinary, the first thing you'll notice is the laid back feel, the great music, and the awesome decor. The staff are also way cool, as well as the crowd,  it's a cool place to people watch. Even the sub sizes are extraordinary, you may pick from the following : Nug (4' ), Pinner ( 8'), or if you've got the extra munchies go with The blunt (12'). \n\nTo add to it's uniqueness all the subs carry the various names of the lovely lady Mary Jane. They also have quite the collection of no meat subs for our veggie friends out there, I'd personally recommend the Griefo. It's a garden veggie sub with guac, mushrooms, and cheba huts very own creation : hemp cream cheese. If you like a little more meat on your sub try The Kind (turkey, bacon, swiss, and mushroom) or The Pakalolo (ham, swiss, and pineapple). These are personal faves of mine. \n\nLastly, they have lots of tasty treats to pair with your meal, such as brownies (hemp is great!), goo balls, rice krispie bars, ect. \n\nSo next time your down by MCC, just look for the bright green VW bus and you'll find Cheba hut: Home of  The Blunts !"
1,Good eats by great people!!
1,"I've now been to Pizza Rock twice. First things first, why not 5 stars? Basically because I've been here twice and I have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. What the heck Pizza Rock? I don't typically go around asking, Hey can I get a local discount? But. When I've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, I've been able to get 20% off but haven't? Arg. That ruffles my feathers.\n\nOn to what is GOOD. Happy hour is awesome. Personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. My friends and I came here during HH and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared the meatballs. Okay. I'm no meatball expert but I think these are delicious. Meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. I also like that these meatballs are simple. I've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. Another reason I like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. Quality. I think.\n\nOther than HH.... I came here with my hubby on a Saturday night. Luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. Service was quick and to the point. Our server neither impressed me or upset me so I'll give a neutral rating for service.\n\nWhat we ordered... The New Yorker 23. It was the one pizza on the menu I figured my picky (and rather plain-Jane) husband would enjoy. The New Yorker comes with: Sliced Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Sliced House Link Sausage, Garlic, Pepperoni, Ricotta. I asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. They were happy to oblige. Under the menu it says, \""Winner, Best Traditional, Las Vegas\"". I'm not sure what that means.\n\nOverall thoughts on the pizza... I enjoyed it. I love the thin crust style. The mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. Pepperoni... Okay. The Ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni and garlic. The flavors were that of a \""normal\"" pizza, but with a refinement. I think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\n\nFinal decision: Mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. Although delicious, I would rather go back for the happy hour. HH is your best bet here. And ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. You'll probably get a discount, unlike me. I'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\n\nOther things I want to go back for:\n\nTheir Margherita (only 73 made per day)\nClam and Garlic Pizza\nLa Regina (The Gold Cup Winner)\nQuail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale Pizza\nCal Italia (again, this comes as one of the Personal Pizzas on HH menu and is a FoodNetwork winner)\nThe Chorizo Mussels (App)\nAnd I would come back again for the meatballs.\n\nLooks, like I'll be making a few return trips. The great thing is, I am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where I live now."
0,I wish zero stars were an option!! I'm only writing this review to warn potential diners of the horrible service and mediocre at best food. I drove thru the lady ''maribel'' was rude as possible I ordered two combos one rolled tacos BEEF with extra cheese and guacamole on the side. When I got my food she gave me one of each little salsa and I double checked by asking her that my rolled tacos were indeed beef not chicken. Then I had to ask for my side of guacamole again which she made obvious was a real hassle for her. Get home chicken rolled tacos with barley any cheese. Don't waste your time and money Maria's taco shop is right across the street.
1,Came highly recommended and lived up to the hype. The oxtail cheese fries were crazy and delicious and the burgers (Miyagi and a custom) were killer. The craft beer list was very strong and the staff was knowledgeable.
0,"No.\n\nThat wasn't directed at anyone in particular. I just don't like this place. The hot dogs are fine, nothing special. The deep fried twinkie is... well, it's disgusting, but that's not really a shock, right?\n\nMy issue is this. I'm not one to pile toppings on my burgers, but cheese is a must, so I ordered the cheddar burger thinking it was a burger with cheese on it. Not a huge leap to make. The burger came with not a slice of cheese but an enormous amount of the worst fake cheese sauce I have ever tasted. \n\nIn conclusion: ...There isn't anything that they have I find specifically worth coming HERE for. You can find a better cheeseburger anywhere and a better hot dog most places."
0,Hit the drive thru here with my husband about a month ago and came down with an awful round of food poisoning. Stay away from this Taco Bell like the plague.
1,"Liege waffles. I'm doing my best to burn that into my mind so I don't forget the name of one of my favorite breakfast finds in a long while. I had them first at Cast Iron Waffles. And boy, what a treat.\n\nLet's talk about this type of waffle. This isn't your standard puffy Belgian that starts crisp but swiftly turns to mush under the weight of maple syrup. These pucks of love are about half the size and two times the weight, sweeter than standard Belgians and dense to bite, made with pearl sugar which caramelizes as the waffle cooks. They're also incredibly tasty.\n\nOn Cast Iron itself -- no, you won't find much seating, and my group was lucky to get the last table available for our group of five. It happens, and is a testament to the shop's quality. Can't eat in? Get something to go. Buy a couple frozen and make them yourself. You'll live to see another day if you don't get a seat, though your waffle surely won't.\n\nOur local friend who recommended the place noted he foolhardily ordered two waffles on his first trip to the establishment. While he ate both, he couldn't manage another bite of food the entire day. One is all you need, he said. And repeated himself. To look on these initially, you wouldn't expect his words to ring true. You're not going to find any of the usual breakfast sides on offer at Cast Iron, but frankly, you won't need them.\n\nMy berry waffle arrived at the table painfully last of all, as I sat in want watching my friends savor their lovely creations. The fruity concoction atop my liege waffle wasn't your average squeezed-from-a-bottle affair, featuring a mix of multiple berries that gave a sweet and sour twist to every flavor-rich, delicious bite. My friend's banana, strawberry and chocolate combo was the best at the table, but mine was still comparably amazing. The coffees, hot and cold, were also universally praised.\n\nThis waffle will make you very full. It will likely shorten your lifespan. It will make you wonder whether Cast Iron offers to wheel you back to your car for a couple bucks extra tip. But it's oh so worth it."
1,"The only complaint I can think of to lodge against Epicerie Fleur is that every single time I have stopped in here, they seem to be playing the same set of songs on loop. As advice to the owner, change up your playlist a bit!"
0,Had a private function here - beautiful space and the staff was attentive and friendly.  Not much here for vegan's and the kitchen didn't try to accommodate very well even though they had all the ingredients to make a great salad!
1,"I've been to 7th Heaven twice. The first time, there was a teenage girl working who dismissively said \""hi\"" to me and that was it. I was looking at shoes, which they have to get your size for you out of a closet, and she never once asked if she could help me. Terrible. I avoided the place after that.\n\nI went back last week as a last ditch effort since Fascinations had nothing for shoes, and Tiffany was working. She was super, super sweet and helpful. She dug through the closet multiple times for me (I'm extremely picky... so sue me), and upon not finding my size in a style I liked, suggested I at least try one size up in one of the brands; tada, they fit! Woohoo! She was even genuinely happy that they fit and that I could leave with a pair of shoes.\n\nAs Kelly said, they do give 15% off for dancers and offer a shoe warranty for $4, where they'll repair your soles or heels. This is a steal since shoes are $50+ and the soles often wear out in 6 months, and unless you looooove blisters, who really wants to buy a new pair and have to break them in all over again? \n\nMinus one star only because they have kind of a limited selection of dresses and like everywhere else, are usually out of stock on 7/8/9s in shoes."
1,"First visit back on May 10, 2012.\n\nFood looks promising when there's a huge slab of pork rotating on a vertical spit, with a pineapple above it (to tenderize the meat).  It's almost as beautiful as one of the girls working the pole down at Sapphire, but I digress.\n\n$2 a taco made me grimace a little, but a smile broke out after I devoured that spicy pork, with its creamy sauce... what was it, pineapple based?  Idk, but I'm coming back.\n\nThe guy working the spit was surprisingly welcoming, and patiently answered my noob questions (\""what's the vampiro?\"" \""the 'vam-pee-roh,'\"" he corrected) despite the line forming behind me.  The lady working the register, unfortunately, seemed annoyed at my very presence.  I suspect the guy gets paid more, and is happy the business seems to be flourishing.\n\nThere's a/c inside, so you can escape the Vegas heat.  But if you enjoy the desert climate, then you can also sit on the covered patio.\n\nThe asada tacos were pretty good too; the chorizo decent.  Nothing beat the flavor of that spicy pork, so I don't bother wasting precious stomach space with less than the best at that location.  Give this place a shot if you're staying on the strip, it's on the right hand side as you drive down Las Vegas Blvd, right around the time you hit Circus Circus.  Tip: learn the side streets (i.e. Paradise Rd), and avoid the terrible traffic."
1,"I don't even know where to begin. Everything about this restaurant was AWESOME! I ordered the lamb chops- they were cooked perfectly and were finger licking good. We had a variety of sides, including rice pudding and asparagus...I wanted to lick the bottom of the bowl- but that would have been classless and common. My companion had a porterhouse steak and refused to leave the table until the entire steak was devoured...what an epic fail that was! We definitely left with doggie bags, and attempted to solicit a wheel barrel or two.\n\nIt's extremely pricey! So be prepared to spend on average about $60 p/p without factoring in adult beverages. The sides are served family style, but it's a stretch to feed more than 2-3 ppl from the smalll side portions. This restaurant is located inside of the beautiful Cosmopolitan Hotel. After dinner, we had a full on photoshoot in the lobby in the Vintage telephone booth. Love love  love!"
0,"went to buy a coffee pot for my wife last night,went thru the self check out.the \""cashier\"" was at her station watching her screen while I was checking my items out,I would scan items and put items into bagging area.when done paid for item then put all item items into cart and cashier stopped me and said to me \""LET ME SEE RECEIPT,NEED TO CHECK FOR YOUR COFFEE POT YOU HAVE THERE MAKE SURE YOU PAY\""Look first off this thing is less than 17.00 and 2nd off it's not worth stealing.you need to learn how be a little more tactful and not accuse people of STEALING RIGHT OFF THE TOP YOU STUPID BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,"I like Dr. Desantos. He seems nice and caring. I cannot stand office staff. They seen arrogant and occasionally rude. There is always really long wait time. It is infuriating, considering that they Require you to come in 15min before appointment time. I was refused to be seen ( by office staff, not MD) because I was there 10min prior appointment (not 30 as they required for 1st appt. It was not justified medically, girl on the phone did not verify Why I have made an appointment, could have had an emergency)\nLooking for another obgyn now."
1,"This isn't a place that you go a whole lot - but BOY are they helpful when you need them!\n\nI brought in my cordless phone that has some special battery internally that was slowly dying to the point that I could only talk on the phone for about 10 minutes per charge.  Not so fun.  I brought the phone here and the guy was super helpful to find the right battery that would work.  While I was there I saw folks getting batteries for SO many amazing and unique things. \n\nSo if you're looking for something a little more complex than a Duracell AA, you should give them a call.  And even if that's all you think you want - if you're in the area you might want to go by because based on what kind of product you're using it for, I heard them suggest different brands/types of AA battery.  Not something I normally want to think about - but handy to know."
0,"Styled like Dos Gringos with bright colors and the whole random stuff stuck to different surfaces - you walk in and get in the cattle drive line with a perfect view of the menu plastered to the wall. Great, easy enough. Their menu has all the basics, and the main reason to visit, SUPER CHEAP BEER!!!! \n\nOur visit we had to wait 15 long minutes because the girl taking orders and pouring beer broke a glass into the rest of the glasses, having to cease all beer orders for what felt like forever.  I get it, shit happens, you drop stuff, but hello attitude. I even gave her a tip because I felt bad and tried to laugh it off with her, but to no avail. They never brought the beer over once it was all situated and had to hunt down someone to give us our much needed Friday fix. The food was \""eh\"" - not a fan of the sauce on the shrimp tacos. Overall, I would go just to drink cheap beer - just don't make the girl behind the counter angry - then you'll never see your beer."
1,One of my favorite Mexican Food Restaurant's.  \n\nJust don't sit at the rail and get the cigarette smoke from passerby's.\n\nFajitas rock.  Service is great and I love the salsa bar.
0,"People are rude. My husband is caucasion but knows all the things we like. He has gone twice and twice, the check out guy treated him poorly. Like he wasn't even there. First time, the guy just looked at him and didn't say a word. The other time, he got passed up on line!!!\nWhat is that about??"
0,"Underwhelmed, I would say the ownership\nand lack of quality employees makes the place mediocre at best. The bread is so heavy, it made me nauseous for a day, and god forbid you ask for any of the freebies you get frowned upon as if you're asking for their bank account information. Not to mention the globs of Mayo they add to these sandwiches and the soggy shredded lettuce and store bought tasting guacamole they put on the Beach Club. Pretty cheap for an expensive sandwich. DISGUST. The owners I believe, a tall guy with green eyes is always touching his nose and his obscenely tan shorter comrade are both very snooty and stuck up. The tan one less so, he seemed a little friendlier. And then the African American kid with braces that claims to be the manager that hates his job? I could literally die. Anywho, after giving that place the benefit of the doubt thinking maybe these were all isolated incidents (which they're not) I have decided to take my business elsewhere."
1,Simple and Sweet\n\nI think Wicked Spoon is probably the definition of vegas buffet! The good chunk of dishes are plated like Hors d'oeuvres. This is good because it helps with being able to try everything in the restaurant! All the food is fresh and amazing and the time they put into the attention to detail is fantastic!\n\nI went on a Sunday brunch around 11:30 and only had to wait 30 minutes. Now i say ONLY 30 minutes because a lot of other solid buffets in Vegas take 2 hours just to get to the cash register and that doesn't even include waiting for a table!\n\nAs for price it was averagely priced (or i think it was) at $35. Pretty reasonable for solid food and beverages. The service was outstanding and the water they give is not tap. They have a special filter in house and serve it in a glass vase bottle. (SO FANCY!)\n\nI would say go try it if you want the Vegas buffet experience and trying not to stay on a reasonable budget. (the rest of the money goes towards bottle service at clubs and gambling! Am i right? :D)
0,"Heard of this place through work. Very disappointed. Flys are horrible and trapped in the dishes, no seating. Outside few tables only had one umbrella for shade so we were melting in the sun. Music is blaring. They were out of nuts, had spoiled butter pecan sitting in the freezer with the other ice cream. Horrible horrible place."
1,I am a big fan of sushi... And this place has an amazing fish quality! Their super white tuna is to die for... Must try
0,I want to take a minute to express the way I feel about the poor service that I encounter at this place . I bought a  Groupon deal  to give this place a try .\nI was greeted at the door by a tall Asian woman  who asked me if I wanted to get a massage and I said yes she stood up and started  to walk me to the message area so I can get the service as soon as I told her I had groupon she automatic stopped and turn around and took me to the door and told me that I couldn't get a message  with out an appointment . There was only one person getting their feet rubbed in the whole place mind you this happen on a weekday at 1 pm  . I asked her why you obviously not busy and you were ready to give me the message . She said in  her poor poor English no no we busy we busy you can only used the coupon after  7 pm and you need to make a appointment in a very rude way like I was stealing from them she said that's the rules of the coupon you can only use it after 7 pm . I proceed to read all the policy's of the groupon and there was no where in the terms that particular offer can be used after a certain time . I explained that to her she said no no go and called someone on the phone who obviously I didn't understand because there was speaking what I believe was Korean but that time I got very upset there was no way I was coming back at night time to use their facilities  and by the way I was treated she open the door and told me to get out .what this place doesn't know is that I am a wedding planner that sends thousands  of brides and brides maids to local places to get messages and get pamper before there special day . I want everyone to know  including my brides and everyone I meet to know how horrible this place is as far a customer service . I felt nothing but insulted . I got my money back from groupon who told me them selfs that was completely unprofessional  there was no time restrictions on the time this groupon can be used and gladly refunded my money . With that said I went to Master spa down the road where  I had a wonderful and relax time.
1,"Continuing our quest to try some new places during Restaurant Week, my wife, Diane, and I went to Nine Fine Irishmen strictly for the food. We wanted to check out their Fish and Chips at lunch during Restaurant Week. The $20.11 per person tariff for a three-course meal was the greatest deal we encountered during Restaurant Week, since the Fish and Chips alone cost $16 on the regular menu. And, they were great! \n\nAmbiance was authentic Irish pub plus a large flat-screen TV on the first floor displaying a college football game live. Audio of the game was even broadcast in the restrooms on the first floor, so no sports fan has to miss any of the action on the field. On the second floor, where we were seated at a fairly plain wood table in all-wood chairs, the game was not audible, which is good for those who are just interested in food or drink. \n\nSlices of thick Irish Soda Bread tasted good and wholesome with basil-tinged butter spread over them. A bowl of creamy Colcannon Soup with pureed potatoes, cabbage, leeks, and several pieces of crispy Irish Bacon was a nice and filling, more jazzed up variant of Cream of Potato Soup. But a Mixed Green Salad composed of complex greens and a few reddish leaves, along with cherry tomatoes cut in half, red onion slices, and cubed cucumbers, that included a pretty ordinary Vinaigrette Dressing, was very bland. It tasted much better after small amounts of both salt and pepper were added. \n\nIrish Chips were actually steak fries that were a little crisp on the outside and a little soft on the inside. They tasted good with or without added tomato ketchup. But the star of the lunch was the fish: hot filets of cod that had been gently beer battered and then deep-fried to a light tan hue. Served with the Chips in paper wrapped inside a cone-like metal basket, the fish filets were tender enough to break apart when yanked out of the densely packed cone. But they flaked more in the mouth than in the hand. \n\nThe quality of the fish reminded me of the same quality experienced at a London pub and at a stand on Haight Street in San Francisco many years ago during my law school years. The fish was delicious whether it was eaten after drops of lemon juice and malt vinegar had been spilled on it, or after being dunked in the excellent house tartar sauce provided, or just consumed as it arrived at the table. As Chips were removed, more filets appeared, until three large ones and one tiny one were ultimately exposed to view. Especially after soup or salad, and with dessert still to come, two of the tender fish filets were easily enough to quell an appetite. The rest were boxed up for home. \n\nBread and Butter Pudding consisting of buttery baked brioche punctuated by golden raisins and served with a smooth Whiskey Cream Sauce and a sweet Caramel Sauce was warm and mouth wateringly good. The two sauces were tasty by themselves, but also harmonized well when used in combination. Irish Coffee Cake turned out to be Tiramisu made with Bailey's Irish Cream. It was extremely rich, and a really strong whiskey flavor permeated this dish. Brown and white in appearance, and served in a sherbet glass, it was decadent but difficult to finish. Half of it was left behind. \n\nService was very good. A few needed utensils like a soup spoon arrived slightly late, but the friendly servers realized and corrected their errors by themselves seconds after they were even noticed. The mood of the whole place was quite genial, convivial, and upbeat--probably because virtually everyone present--a mix of tourists and locals--was enjoying the excellent food (and drinks) being served. Besides finding my go-to place in Las Vegas from now on for Fish and Chips, I saw other diners happily tearing into a Cheeseburger, a Sliced Corned Beef Sandwich on Rye, and Irish Bangers resting on Mustard Mashed Potatoes. \n\nOnly a fairly ordinary salad kept my meal from being a five-star dining  experience. I will definitely be back!"
1,The Cobb salad was really good. Loved the balsamic dressing. Ask for Daryl. Best waiter ever because he used to be a butler!!! He is finishing law school. Nice man.
0,"It's not that great. We got the Korean bbq plate, snow crab legs, mussels and two lbs of crawfish, mellow and crackin. There was just so much gooey seasoning that I couldn't really taste the food underneath. The Korean bbq was really good though. \n\nEverything is given to you in a bag and you just make a mess all over the table with the shells, which was a little unappealing to me. The seasoning was just a gooey, slimy mess dumped over everything, crackin wasn't very spicy, and mellow was pretty bland. I wish I had just gotten everything plain. I'm actually contemplating going home and rinsing all my leftovers off. \n\nAnyway, our waitress was a really sweet girl, but I don't feel like she actually knew how to be a waitress. I also felt a little uneasy as the owner stood behind the bar watching me throughout the entire meal as if I were stealing something. \n\nIn all, I don't think I will come back again, and if I do, I will be sure to order everything plain."
1,"I absolutely LOVE Audra! \n\nI have been a devoted client of hers for probably well over a year or so? I've had a wonderful experience EVERY time! She has a beautiful, clean studio and is such a lovely person. She has a very comforting personality and is so accommodating and pleasant. Her waxes are as painless as they come - and she is quick, very convenient!  Her prices are quite reasonable and she has always been flexible with scheduling and rescheduling when necessary.\n\nI usually go for wax appointments, but I have had her facial treatment as well, and it was outstanding! Very relaxing and my skin looked fabulous after!\n\nIf you go elsewhere - you're missing out!!!"
1,"You know how when you have a favorite (fill in the blank) restaurant, that's pretty much your benchmark when trying to decide whether or not to try new eateries similar in nature?  Or is it just me?  \n\nAnyway, my favorite buffet for years has been the Bellagio Buffet.  Probably what made it the best was the awesome selection and the king crab legs that they served.  The last time I went there though, they didn't have king crab legs so then I really had no real strong desire to HAVE to go back there.  I mean, let's be honest.  A buffet is a buffet is a buffet.  Right?  WRONG!\n\nStudio B in the M Resort has ousted the title of best buffet in Vegas, in my book.  *erasing Bellagio and writing in Studio B*  First of all, the selection.  Once you enter the dining area after the line for the ends after over an hour long wait, you'll see that it looks like a maze.  But I thought to myself, \""Ah, it's probably another one of those buffets that have duplicate dishes on either side, to make the line more efficient, right?  WRONG!\n\nEvery single plate, nook, cranny of that line has a different dish.  I think what I like best about this buffet is that there's a lot of Asian themed dishes here, reminiscent of dishes that you can find in Hawaii.  Yes, I'm Asian.  (You just looked at my profile picture again just to make sure I wasn't lying, didn't you?) And yes, I'm from Hawaii.  So when there's something on the buffet line in a resort NOT located in The California Hotel or in the Main Street Station Hotel and Casino, it's actually pretty impressive.  Kal bi?  Teriyaki steak?  Wow.  If I lived in Vegas, this would definitely be a place that I would come to so I could get  my local food fix.  They also have crab legs!  OK, so it's not king crab legs.  But it was still delicious!  \n\nSo what's the worst part of a buffet?  Having to pay for drinks when you already paid a lot for the food, right?  WRONG!  They even give you unlimited wine and beer here!  When I went, I didn't have any since I don't like to drink when I'm trying to binge eat and pretend I'm not going to eat again for a week.  But next time I go, I'm definitely going to get some alcohol to consume with my meal.\n\nWhat's the second worst part of a buffet?  Poor service, right?  WRONG!  The service here was great.  Our server ensured our iced teas were always refilled and we had all the napkins or whatever else we needed at hand.  \n\nIf you come to Vegas, make sure you come here.  And try to come on a weekend so you get the FULL (seafood) buffet.  Don't walk...RUN!  It'll bump you up ahead of at least a few people in line, guaranteed!"
0,"I have eaten here three times. The first visit was with a sushi group from meetup.com. The fish is as good as it gets in the middle of the desert hundreds of miles away from the ocean. The rolls inventive enough to keep your interest. \nThe service while attentive isn't top notch. Too many rules to follow should you choose the AYCE option.\nTonight, while entertaining friends from out of town, I had a truly unpleasant experience paying the bill. Without looking at the check, a credit card was presented and charged. They added an additional 20% gratuity and labeled it as TAX. Then they added sales tax to the total INCLUDING the gratuity. \nWhen we questioned the charge, the manager said they automatically add a 20% gratuity to parties of five or more. I pointed out their menu states 18% on parties of SIX or more. He said they've changed policy but have not changed the menu.\nSAY WHAT?\nHad to argue with the manager to have the charge reversed. Told him that if he didn't immediately reverse the charge, I would dispute the charge with the credit card company.\nTime to find a new sushi bar."
0,"Upon entering TC's, the decor is very warm & inviting. We were the only people in the place on a Saturday morning.\n\nWe wanted to come for breakfast. There was no breakfast menu even though they are open for it? Not a big deal, but wanted to try a new breakfast joint.\n\nService was a bit slow for being an empty restaurant, but we were not in a hurry so it was not the end of the world.\n\nOrdered a 3 meal combo & a cheeseburger.\n\nLet me say the sweet tea might have been some of the worst ever. I personally despise Lipton & GMO tea. I always felt a sweet tea would come from a brand maybe made or big in the South? Maybe a better brand? \n\nThe meal came... the cole slaw & mac & cheese were our sides. I will say this was some pretty great mac & cheese. The cole slaw was blended perfectly as well. The sides were better than our meats (brisket, pulled chicken, & rib tips).\n\nWhether it was the brisket or the pulled chicken, something had a weird aftertaste to it. Not sure if it was the sauce or freezer burn. \n\nCheeseburger was nothing special. Just a frozen patty fired up. Some meat probably purchased from Sysco Foods. A shame because a ground burger from Brisket would have been totally better. \n\nThis is one of those rare moments where I felt bad for the struggling business. If I could nominate them for Restaurant:Impossible, I would. The decor is so nice and inviting to just have a dud in food."
1,"I have been to Gordon Biersch 3 times now. I have had their sliders, garlic fries, south western eggs rolls, lobster bisque, and tapas. I will say the only thing I was not a fan of was the lobster bisque. I am very particular when it comes to soups and I like soups that are chunky, not ones that are just broth or soups that have been pureed. The lobster bisque had no chunks of lobster and no lobster flavor. So tell me why they call it lobster bisque? I dunno. Anyways, this is kinda like an Applebees or Chilis but a little more upscale and trendier. Same kinda food though, american bar food. So I wouldn't come here and order some kind of fancy pasta, seafood and probably wouldn't order a steak. But the apps, sammiches, and drinks are pretty tasty. Oh yeah, drinks. I have had a beer flight and it was ok. I'm not a big beer drinker. If you are though, the beer flight is a fantastic option to figure out what their best brew is. One drink I am a fan of from Gordon Biersch is the pomegranite mojito. I could drink 10 of these things and not think twice till after I am hugging the porcelain goddess. Haha. They are really fruity and smooth. Great girly drink! Go here is you are looking for a good happy hour or after work location to have a few drinks and bites with friends   :)"
0,"I'd give more stars, but this is the 3rd time my father & I have gone & had to leave because there is only 1line open & is out the door despite the number of people working at the time."
0,Totally unimpressed. Way to expressive and was rushed off our lane 10 mins before we even finished. I was with a group of girls and we opened a tab on my card and the server encouraged them to just bill my card
0,"I used \""You Dirty Dog\"" for about a year.  While there were some great groomers, the way they ran their business wasn't good.  The way they booked appointments caused the groomers to be consistently late.  The final straw was an appointment where the groomer was 2+ hrs late, groomed only 1 1/2 (don't ask) of my 3 dogs and then the owner never bothered to return numerous emails or phone calls to reschedule.  I was FURIOUS!\n\nI have since moved on to \""Doggy a Go Go\"" and am thrilled with their service and groomers!!  Check 'em out!"
0,Worst dimsum I have ever eating.  Receptionist has horrible attitude.  The guy I think is the owner.  We had 16 people and they refused to put 2 tables together.
0,"Order for delivery tonight.  The delivery took over 2 hours.  All I was told was \""sorry, we were busy tonight\"".  Pizza is decent, but not worth a two hour wait....will never order from here again."
0,"My In-law came in from Kingman, AZ to visit and took us out to eat. He loves Black Bear and first started to frequent these restaurants in Lake Havasu.... Unfortunately, he was dissapointed.\n\nThe portions at this restaurant, although it is a chain, are smaller... same menu though... And as I write this review me and my wife are in bed sick (it must have been their food because it was the only thing we ate today). \n\nLove their coconut cream pie! Would go back ANY day...  just, please, standarize the portions =)  We go strictly for their huge burgers and taco salads, which are usually great!"
0,"Pampas is a Brazilian steak house located on the South side of Planet Hollywood.  In short, it's a decent alternative for hungry carnivores who are tired of buffets.\n\nIf you haven't been to a churrascaria, it's an all you can eat affair where there's a nice salad bar and a few side dishes - but instead of a buffet, the staff bring large skewers of meat around to your table.  Most places have a signal (like a coaster) that says \""more please\"" or \""I'm still chewing\"".\n\nI guess I'm spoiled by Fogo de Chao.  I have visited the DC location several times and it has become a favorite stop for me and many of my traveling buddies.  Pampas is the same concept, except executed with value in mind.  Said differently, Target and ShopKo are both variety stores, but I'm pretty sure most people would much rather go to Target if given a choice.  Pampas is the ShopKo here - a little less quality, a little cheaper, and a lower atmosphere factor.\n\nThe meat is OK - certainly comparable to the stuff served at Outback or any other chain restaurant and is a little over seasoned.  The preparation is good, but not great.  The salad bar was pretty fresh and had a reasonable variety.\n\nWe were seated quickly and reasonably well attended to by the friendly staff.  We had to wait a bit on some of the meats, but not enough to complain about it.  The convenient location is nice, as are the short waits.\n\nI'm on the fence with the stars here.  Certainly, I could go 3 in terms of overall quality and experience, but it's the value quotient here that leaves me cold.  If you can score this for $25 - it's an easy 3-star experience.  If you get suckered in for $40, then it's a bust down to two stars."
1,"Bella Serra is an Italian gem in downtown.\n\nThey have some of the best, most delicious wine options - including organic. What really impressed me was their effort at sustainability and buying local when they can.\nThe only reason they didn't get 5 stars was because the menu is slightly limiting. But the food is great!"
0,"I love their pizza, but I tried to call to pick up a pizza tonight and was put on hold.  For 5 minutes!  I thought they forgot about me, so I called back and was asked to hold again.  I told them I wanted to order a pizza and was already on hold for 5 minutes.  I was told, \""well, could you just hold for a couple of minutes longer?\"" and was promptly put on hold again.  I gave up.  They got issues . . ."
1,"Sabas has been around forever,  and the quality has always been consistently good.  Their $5 gyro pita deal is insane for the great gyro you get.  The tzazilki (I know I spelled that wrong) is delicious.  \n\nTry the lamb too, its veey good. The owners and staff are always very nice.  Good local spot."
0,"The food is good, but unfortunately they have new people working the register that aren't as good - in fact, rather lazy. On 8/22, the girl at the register went and sat in the back of the kitchen rather than tend to customers out front. When our order came out, an item was missing. We figured no big deal, maybe she is new. On 8/29, we called our order in at 5:50pm to pick up. When we got there it was busy. After several people came in after us and got their orders before us, we asked about our order. Except for two items that had been made (which were ultimately cold), the rest hadn't been made - she hadn't followed up on our order and couldn't have cared less that it hadn't been made. We asked to speak to the manager who wasn't there. The other girl wrote a message, but of course I doubt the manager ever saw it. So, forty minutes later we got our food and left and I doubt we'll return unless they can muster up some better customer service."
0,"My friends and I came here after finding out the wait at Caesar's Bacchanal was over four hours long. I ordered a rising sun burger cooked medium and shared a milkshake with a friend. Later that night, I started feeling dizzy and disoriented so I excused myself to my room. What ensued was 12+ hours of severe food poisoning. I have never experienced such terrible food poisoning in my life. I finally had to go to the ER the next day because I'm from out of town and I had to check out of the hotel. I could barely get up from the bathroom floor.\n\nSo yeah. Basically the worst food related experience of my life."
0,"The food here is top notch, don't know where to find better chicken and waffles. I keep coming back, but there's something wrong when I have bad service over half the time.\n\nI don't know what the deal is, but on more than one occasion we've had unpleasant waiters/waitresses. I don't ask for much at restaurants, but reflling water or asking for a couple more minutes to look at the menu should not warrant a skank face. Maybe the serving staff had a bad day... multiple times... during the same week...\n\nEh, who knows. I guess that makes it a \""legitimate\"" Southern experience, but regions don't excuse poor service. I suggest going for the classic combo, but don't be surprised if things go south from there..."
1,"Stayed at this place quite a few times over the years. Everytime I'm in Vegas for work, this is where my company buys my room. For good reason, $40 a night on weekdays. Very reasonable for such a nice place. Swimming pool, arcade, bowling, bingo, buffet, movie theatre, gambling, you want it, they have it. Only bad things are the fact that it's far away from the strip and the internet is $12.99 per day per device. Nightlife is marginal at best (Take that with the caviot that I've never been here on a weekend). Buuuut if you are in Vegas and don't mind being right on the strip this is the place for you!"
1,"I love this place! The food is consistently outstanding,  inexpensive, and fresh. And the women who run this place are so damn cute. Don't miss it!"
0,"Pro: Cheap, very close to the convention center, free parking, entertaining family business, AC works.\n\nCon: Cheap, you may not survive the night, parking lot full of titty cards \n(thank you aaron), the family never leaves, 1950 fallout bathroom. Lack of internet, bring your own aircard. Freaking Chinese cooking with hot plates in their room.\n\nChecked in, was handed keys for front door and room door. Scared. Room was pretty clean, I think... Was worried that my fat ass will send the tub to the first floor. Woken by friends at night of a break in next door, ignored him and went back to sleep, only to see the super fixing a broken door and frame in the morning. Seems like our neighbor were able to get through the front door with their keys, but was too drunk to figure out how to open their door... so they kicked it down and went to sleep, yet to be hauled away by the cops. Good times.\n\nI would stay here again just for the sheer distance to the convention center and the price during CES. But not until the door frame is strengthened..."

0,"For a single incident, I would just swallow it.  After these few incidents, I will not use any cab in Charlotte especially from the airport.\nA month ago, I called a cab to the airport early in the morning.  I made it very clear that I need the cab at my house at 6 am as I have a flt to fly out.  I asked if that was posssible, the operator said yes.  It was around midnight when I called.\nAt 6 am, I looked over the window, there was no cab.  6:05 no cab.  I got nervous as I was catching a flt to go to work.  I called yellow cab again, then she said there was no cab available.  I screamed as I would miss my flight to work.  She said she was trying but she had never notified me earlier.  I couldn't wait as the clock ticks. I had no other choice but to wake up my neighbor to give me a ride.  Thank God, with the kindness of my neighbor and my professionalism, I ran and ran and ran inside the airport and finally got to the gate be the last one before they closed the door.\n3 weeks ago, I came home at the airport to take a cab since my house was within 3-4 miles.  It was my first time using a cab.  I didn't know how much here but I had in San Francisco for less than $15 (with airline discount, they charge $12).  So I thought I better to use a cab instead of calling friends around.  I need to go to my house to get my car key then to the hotel right by the airport to get my car.  I explained very clearly to the cab driver who said nothing about the charge.  He didn't turn on the meter as I thought charge shown on meter.  As I got to my house, he said he would charge me double.  I asked how much and why double and what was supposed to be?  He started to yell at me.  Finally, I was charged $28 for a 6 miles ride.  I didn't know if that was acceptable.  I said  to myself I learned, if he overcharged me, I treated that as donation and God blesses.  I was too busy.\nLast night, I took a cab again from CLT airport just to go home that was really 4 miles.  The driver was acting like a wild animal, very unfriendly, talking everything I had no idea what he was talking.  He kept saying I had no idea how long people were waiting.  I asked what people?  Other passengers?  They were behind me and shouldn't be longer than me.  Or the drivers?  I even asked him to take me back to the airport if he didn't want to have the business.  He was driving crazy and I hoped there was a police car closed by.  Unfortunately when we want to see a cop, they were not there but when we didn't want to see them, there was always one.\nFinally, I was safe home.  I still could not understand what was going wrong with these cab drivers.  If someone can help to explain to me.\nBTW, if these cab drivers hate their work, find another one.  I was still figuring out what was their problem.  Perhaps, a few miles were too short the trip?  They were looking for someone who needs to go 100 miles or to another city?  For long ride, people will rent a car for $20-$30 a day and gas.  People need a cab if that is more economic than renting a car for a day.  Anyway, at least I understand why they are still driving an angry cab cos they don't know how to do maths."
1,"I'm sure the cake displays front of house are really there to shout out to you \""come in and try me...I dare you\"", that is my excuse. I was really lucky to get a seat here at the right time in this cosy cafe near the Elephant House.\n\nWith quick service for afternoon Earl Grey tea and delightful Strawberry Tart (note OMG must try some of the other cakes next time), and three cups of tea from one pot for around \u00a36, you can't go far wrong that try Valarie Pattesserie if your in the area, and you need a seat!\n\nNoticed they do proper meals, but didn't have time, because I was enjoying cake so much, but will do more next time...that's a promise."
0,"This place used to be some kind of Deli from NYC but it's been converted into a hot dog joint? They got rid of the table seating and there's a poker room there now...wth!   My friends and I were in a hurry to grab some food and this was literally the only dining option available at treasure island.  I really think TI is in need of hiring a new director of food and beverage because the restaurant selections at the hotel are so bad it's not even funny.  Anyway, I wanted something quick and easy so I went ahead and got a chili cheese hot dog with coleslaw on the side.  The dog was wrapped in some funny plastic sheet so when I was ready to eat the darn thing it was super soggy and nasty.  I ended up just using a knife and fork to assault my food.  The hot dog itself tastes like any store bought, mass produced amalgamation of meats.  The chili didn't taste that well and I wouldn't be surprised if it came out of a bag.  Coleslaw was surprisingly refreshing and good.  I tried some of their house cut fries and they were nicely done!  If you want eat something quick at TI, avoid this place and go to that pizzeria near the self parking garage or just walk across to the fashion mall's food court."
1,"Roberto's is one of my favorite places to get Mexican food~ It's cheap and good, not to mention, this location is really clean and empty!! So far, this is the only Roberto's that I really enjoy eating at because of its cleanliness. The staff is really friendly and pretty quick at preparing your food :) \n\nSome of my favorite things to order is the carne asada enchilada or the burrito! Mmm! It makes me hungry just thinking about it! Also, to the left of the cash register there is a sauce bar where your fave hot sauces are located along with to-go cups and various veggies.\n\nHowever, there are some things on the Roberto's menu that are just too small or too untasteful to be sold! So, be careful when ordering! Otherwise, enjoy a nice enchilada at this fun & clean location :)"
0,"Nothing good to say. One of the drivers almost hit my car on street. When we stop , almost side by side, he opened his mini van door and he started saying things to me. What kind of philosophy have this company ??? Probably rude and unprofessional people."
0,"So we were in the shopping center and he decided that since I like Thai food, we would go here. I was hoping they had improved since my last visit. Service was good, food is not with returning for. The pad Thai was so sticky clumps of it dangled from the fork for over a minute- kind of like that dried out spaghetti on a buffet, looked like & even tasted like rubber bands. Maybe 5 pieces of green onion in the whole dish (less than a full green onion) which made it extremely bland. \nEven the wide rice noodles in the spicy Thai noodle were rubbery. I know it is not just me when he says \""the food is s**t here\"". I do believe this is the worst Thai restaurant we've ever been to. Maybe since the employees are Chinese. Guaranteed not to give them another try for 3 strikes."
1,"Amazing freshness!! Fantastic service!! Delicious flavors!! If you are unsure of what is on the menu or how to eat your meal, ask and they will give a quick tutorial   :).  I've eaten here for years and NEVER had a bad meal or service."
0,"Quite literally the worst experience I've ever had taking my car into a shop.\n\nA few weeks ago I found myself desperate for an oil change. This was the first place I called that could get me in the same day and it is fairly close to my office. As I pulled up I had a feeling that I should've just immediately left  - the place looks scary from the outside and the barbed wire fence is extremely uninviting. I went against my gut feeling and I decided to take my appointment as scheduled and boy do I regret it!\n\nAfter giving them the keys to my car and waiting patiently for 45 minutes one of the \""technicians\"" came out to the waiting area and asked for my assistance in the back to take a look at my hood. After changing my oil he must have tried closing the hood while there was something blocking it from shutting. My hood no longer closed properly and was roughly a 1/4\"" off. To fix this cost me $200 at the Infiniti body-shop.\n\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, less than a day after my oil change I noticed my car was leaking oil! I took it in the Infiniti maintenance center for an inspection and they told me that my oil pan has been punctured. Another $200 repair.\n\nIn total their poorly done oil change ended up costing me over $430 for their fee and the repairs.\n\nDo not trust these people with your car!"
0,"We were very excited to visit the new Snooze in Phoenix with our relatives from Denver.  We arrived on a Sunday morning, at 10 am, and were told that the wait time was 60 to 75 minutes.  TWO HOURS LATER, after checking with the hostess three times after 90 minutes, we were told that we were the next table and that there were only 3 names ahead of us.  I didn't have the heart to ask WHAT that meant!  Obviously, by the time that we were seated, we had decided which items each of us would order.  Between the 8 of us, we each ordered something different to try and get a good cross section of the offerings.  Ok, lets start with the positive.  Our server was excellent.  Ummmmmmmmm, I didn't try the bacon, but it looked fine.  Our booth was comfortable.  Silverware was clean.  Now, the rest of the story.  One would think that with a two hour wait the food should be pretty darn impressive.  Most of the people, who were around us while we were waiting, were also making their first visit to Snooze AM Eatery.  It will be interesting to see how long the hype can keep crowds curious.  I ordered the corn beef hash.  It arrived with 2 cold eggs, over easy, and a pitiful small helping of burnt has browns with less than an ounce of corned beef.  (I've owned my own restaurant for 30 years, it was less then an ounce.)  I tried 2 bites of each of the pancakes that we had ordered.  The first to see how they were, and the second to make sure that they were actually as bad as I thought after the first bite.  I honestly don't know which was worse, the presentation, or the nasty taste.  They all sounded great on the menu.  Well, they can certainly talk the talk, but they definitely can not walk the walk.  Lets just say that I would not return to this restaurant if it was across the street from my house, with no wait, and it was free.  At 61 years of age, and for someone who has eaten all over the Country, and eats out often, this is by far the worst food that I have ever been served in a restaurant. P.S. I know why they call the French Toast, OMG.  It was exactly what I said as I pushed the plate away."
1,"***!!!!!***WARNING TO ALL WHO WON'T/CAN'T EAT BLOOD***!!!***!!!**\nThis is a great restaurant, my friends and I were all very happy with everything EXCEPT one thing. HANGOVER SOUP!!! It tastes great, however it contains large chunks of jellied Ox Blood. I ordered it not knowing what was in it. It highly offensive to me to eat blood as I see that it violates bible commands at Deuteronomy 12:23 and Acts 15:20,29. Other than that I loved the KimChee, the radishes are amazing. Literally the best Kimchee I've ever had. The restaurant has a very authentic feel and the workers are all Korean and there is even Korean TV playing in the dining room. I only can wish that they would have had a warning about the Blood as I had no idea when I ordered. (didn't find out until I had eaten half of it!)...I did of course inform the waitress about the need to have it disclosed on the menu and she seemed very accommodating."
1,"My family and I really enjoyed our first visit to Bahama Breeze. I have been meaning to try it for some time. We went in on a Saturday afternoon and they were not too busy. The food was pretty good, but the best part of the visit was the staff. When we first walked in, one of the servers walked up to my kids who were looking and the fountain and pulled two pennies out of his own pocket for them to throw into the fountain. When we were first sat it took a couple minutes for our waiter to come to the table and two of the other servers (who had just gotten off) noticed and without us having to ask went and found our server. Our server was also very friendly and did a great job. My family and I will definitely be returning to this restaurant in the future."
0,"I ate here for brunch with my family. I thought the food was lacking in creativity. There was nothing special about the food. The service was good. The atmosphere was fun looking out onto the casino. The food was overpriced for what you were getting, which was simple plates. So, I don't recommend it to those on a budget and want good chinese food."
1,Nice place to go for kids !
0,"idk...i've gotta say, i've had far better pizza than this.  i too was excited to try this place based on the reviews.  we got decent service, in fact our server was super nice and cute.  we split a salad that was simply lettuce and spinach with a tomato thrown in. the 5 bucks we spent on that could have purchased both 1 bag of lettuce and 1 bag of spinach.\n\nmy first glass of wine was corked and so much so that when i went to take a drink it burned my eyes but they were very nice about getting me a new glass of wine.\n\nnow on to the pie...  \n\nwe got the spinach special which came with a saccharin sweet sauce; personal preference would be a bit tangier but it was the grease and the crust that was the bummer.  when i get thin crust i like it to be crisp but this? not so much.  mush to the sogg town. \n\ncan't say that we will come back, there are just too many good pizza places in town."
1,"Talk about team work and Awesome service & you would go wrong without making mention of Toast.. \n\nThis place is a great combination if the model of team work & good customer service with good food for the most part. My Family & I have a weekly ritual to go to brunch every Saturday as part of our Family Day Fun.\n\nToday (Saturday - it's after midnight so yesterday) was our second visit. We returned for the good service & good food according to my family & myself for the most part. The only thing I had a problem with was my Banana Nut French. toast. I make it at home & I don't make it & put peanut butter with cooked bananas mixed with nuts (soggy may I add) in between bread & call it stuff French toast. I personally prefer my Banana nut French toast to be presented & prepared with the uncooked bananas & nuts on top of the cooked French Toast. If you prefer it made the way I described that it was made then \""Go For It\"".. \nOur dishes are as follows (weekly routine after my mishap) & we are always pleasantly pleased..\nEgg White Avocado, Tomato & Parmesan cheese omelette (it is on the menu with bacon but I get it minus the bacon & add Mushrooms) with a side of Fruit &Rye Toast.\nEgg white veggie omelette with a side of Turkey Bacon, Cheese grits & Rye Toast..\nBreakfast sandwich with eggs scrambled hard with cheddar cheese, turkey bacon on White..\n\n\nThe Bellini is AMAZING may I add..\nGreat place for brunch which is the only thing we've had as a family or individually. Very nice to Enjoy the patio while its still weather friendly.. \n\nBon Appetite"
0,"I really wanted to give this place a better rating!  I've heard amazing things about it, so maybe that raised my expectations.\n\nI went with a few friends and they called in our deep-dish half cheese, half green pepper and mushroom pizza about an hour ahead of time and it wasn't even ready when we got there.  The waitress kept forgetting about us, it seemed, and the place was packed and not well-staffed enough for the amount of people here.\n\nWell, you guys know how I feel about customer service, so that would bring it down at least 1.5, if not 2, stars.\n\nThe thing is, their pizza was awful!  There was too much dough and not enough cheese; the sauce was a bit under-spiced in my opinion, and the vegetables on my half of the pizza were sparse and didn't taste fresh.  I came in starving and didn't even eat a whole piece of pizza.\n\nI do remember, however, coming here years ago and really enjoying the thin crust pizza.  I saw some other people with it and it looked and smelled a lot better than mine, too, leading to my decision to give Papa Del's two stars instead of one.\n\nAlso, the bathrooms were clean.\n\nThat's about all I have to say."
0,"Tried this place for the first time.  The prices are reasonable however the food is sub par!  I ordered over easy eggs and got over medium to over hard eggs.  Not happy!!!  Pancakes take like dirty dish cloth!!  Yuck!!!  The bacon and hashbrowns were actually very good.  Customer service was average, nothing memorable.\n\nWon't be back!!!  Sorry, there are way too many breakfast places in the valley to choose from.  If you want to stand out, you have to do better than this.\n\nRecommend Peoria Cafe or Brothers instead!!!"
1,"Probably one of the best Gyros I've had in Phoenix!  What is also great is you can order from their website, pay for it and have it ready for you when you get there!  (Great for those of us with 30 min lunches)."
1,"Really good food. The Organic Edamame Soybeans Stir Fried with Garlic/Ginger/Chili were AMAZING. So were the Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries with Garlic Chili Aioli. I got some with my burger and it was enough to share between 3 people. They have some really good beers here on the menu but the one the waitress suggested they were out of, and the next one she suggested they only had 1 left of. Also we tried to use the Yelp check-in offer which is buy 1 beer get 1 free and apparently you can only use it late at night. They did finally let us use it however since we mentioned it to the waitress when we ordered and she didn't say we couldn't use it until the bill came. I got The Crusty Crab and was so excited about it because it was supposed to come with avocado but there wasn't any on it. Same with my friend's. My other friend had The Banh-Mi Burger and she loved it. We were celebrating my birthday and they gave us free Portuguese Doughnuts with Coffee Gelato. I can't wait to go back and try the Kalbi Burger and Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. One thing to mention is the Windmill location isn't that big and we had a long wait on a weeknight."
0,"This was my 2nd try at this salon. The 1st time I wasn't very happy. I had better hair cuts at salons at half the price. The left side wasn't cut the same as the right side, and not evenly tapered. But, I tried for a second time. Big mistake! This cut is harder to manage then the first. She did cut it very fast and I think she wanted to save her self some time by cutting it less layered at the top. This has left my hair wanting to lay too flat on top. \n\nBoth times I went to this salon I was the stylist's 1st appointment. Both times she was late. She was over 10 minutes late for work and she rushed me out with a speed cut."
1,"I just got back to work after eating at Little Hong Kong and I am so happy I found this place.  I have worked in the are for 3 years and there are not many places to eat for lunch.  \n\nI enjoyed the Orange Chicken and my friend had the Chicken Chow Mein.  Both dishes were big (enough to split) and very good.  We both had enough to take home for lunch tomorrow.  Each dish came with Egg Roll, fried wonton, vegetable fried rice and the choice of salad bar or Egg Drop Soup.  You can not beat the prices $6.50 each.  Also, we were in and out in less then an hour.\n\nIf you are looking for a clean, friendly enviornment and good food I recommend Little Hong Kong!!!"
1,I'm smelling the strawberry massage bar as I'm typing this and getting hungry... They were having some sale where they give away a surprise gift if we buy anything. I bought a strawberry massage bar and got another... FREE! Their bar shampoos I feel dries out my hair but they smell incredible. Almost everything smells good enough to eat...
1,"This place was so much fun!  The band was absolutely amazing.  The ONLY reason they didn't get a 5th star, was because I asked the hostess a few days beforehand if there was dancing, and she said \""yes, the band is awesome and they move the tables out so people can dance.\""  The band WAS definitely amazing, but everyone kind of just stood there and my wife wanted to dance on her bday.  Other than that.... awesome!"
0,If you don't care about quality Chinese food panda is the place...\nI don't mess with meat there
0,"My lord has this place changed!  Use to come here all the time. They were sold 4-5 years back, so I thought. Seems they are bank owned now. \n\nUse to have limo pick up with no problem. Well, my host arranged for it, but he put the wrong pick up time. Once the driver got there he was apologetic and explained the confusion. \n\nI went to check in and VIP check in was closed. I checked in the normal line and no comp card or tournament info was given to me. I asked asked and they were clueless. \n\nHope they get it all figured out. Thi place use to be great. Games now suck, but I still get offers for free room and food, which is a good deal. \n\nI stopped by on my way back from Cali. I'm in the free tournament, I think. I'll find out around 9am. \n\nOverall, cheap place to stay with Mono rail service to the strip, or a short walk for the adventurous ones out there."
1,"BEST VALUE LATE NIGHT FOOD SPECIALS IN LAS VEGAS!\n\nThe Coronado cafe (inside the SouthPointe Casino) may be a few miles South of the Strip, but it's a good place for late-night eats.  Their $3.95 steak and eggs special (including hash brown and toast) features a made-to-order steak that actually is of a decent quality!  They also have other specials, all under $4.00, that are equally tasty.  I was impressed by their service, too.  Coffees and waters were filled before we had to ask and the servers couldn't be more pleasant and helpful.  The Coronado Cafe is in a cavernous area with high ceilings, so it is huge and can be filled even at 2 am!  When we were there, I was talking to a friend so much that my food went cold.  When I asked a server to please zap it in a microwave, she returned with ALL NEW FOOD!  What a pleasant surprise.  I'd recommend the Coronado Cafe to anyone who's looking for a great late-night value.  Unfortunately, the only complaints I would have are that 1) the place is so large it can be quite noisy and 2) their late-night specials menu could include a flat pancake & egg dish.  Currently, all they offer is a pancake sandwich similar to a McGriddle."
1,"Always excellent service--the food is amazing too, but the service is top notch and keeps me coming back several times a week! :)"
0,"I have to start with the fact that we haven't had Thai food before. \nThe hostess was very nice and sat us and got our drinks. Sadly, it went downhill from there. My husband asked to sample a small amount of sauce to see if he would like it before getting an entree and after much back and forth was told no. We got a soup that I enjoyed somewhat but it had something odd in it that was not meat or mushroom no one asked how it was. Both of our entrees had ok flavor but both dishes had meat that was very tough and off flavor, my beef his chicken. Again she never asked if everything was okay. She asked if I wanted a to go and when I said no took my plate either not noticing or choosing not to see that all the meat was still there. So was it just that we are not fond of Thai food? Maybe but the service was less than helpful. I got the feeling that they have their regulars and if no one else comes they are okay with that?\nSo if your a Thai enthusiast and know what you like go for it, but if it's new to you I would say find a more friendly to the newbie joint."
1,Love this place. The food is great. The staff is great. A ton of stuff to choose from. Can't go wrong here.
0,"Not at all impressed by the food at India Oven. I've been here a couple of times & it's definitely going downhill. It was never that great to begin with but one huge noticeable change is how they bring out the tandoori chicken when you go for the buffet. Before, they used to serve it on a hot & sizzling fajita platter with onions & lemons & we went there just a couple of days ago and all they brought out was 2 pieces of cold tandoori chicken on a small plate. The chicken itself didn't taste good. As far as the buffet, it's nothing great ... actually, it was not even good. The mango lassi had a weird taste, super tart, almost as though it had gone bad. The two Indian chicken curry options had okay tasting gravy; the chicken was a little slimy though so I didn't eat it. The chilli chicken was not tasty at all, just spicy & it was almost like they had tried to make it Chinese style? The vegetarian options weren't much better either. My date & I were discussing the food as we were eating it & I think I said \""I don't like that\"" enough times that I'm not going to be returning to this restaurant. The only thing I did say that was good, & in my opinion is a huge part of enjoying Indian food, was the garlic naan. Also, the service was on par, even when it was busy. Highly disappointed with my experience, especially when there aren't many Indian restaurants to eat at in the Gilbert area."
0,"I wish it were possible to give a business 0 stars because this auto repair facility committed several cardinal sins today and are not trustworthy. \n\n(Background: I am a young female who has had plenty of trouble with being treated unfairly in the auto repair world. It is my pet peeve. It is wrong. And you - mechanics - should feel ashamed for taking advantage of women car owners because you think you can.)\n\nI went to Treadquarters today for help after I noticed a screw had punctured my tire earlier this morning. The tire wasn't deflated yet and the screw was deeply embedded in the tread. I needed a patch so I could go on about my day. When I looked Treadquarters up online they were advertising \""Free Tire Repair\"" with some exclusions, none of which applied to me. This coupon, paired with their good reviews, made it an easy decision to stop by. \n\nThe young man who greeted me seemed a little turned off by my coupon. I'm assuming this company offers such incentives so that customers will bring them other business that creates better revenue. A smart strategy. However, it doesn't work if your employees are begrudging and dishonest. He went out to my car to look at the damage and proceeded to feed me some bullsh*t about the screw being too close to the side wall. The screw was definitively NOT in the side wall or anywhere near it, no matter how many times he tried to show me with his \""thumb measurement\"". It was only about an inch away from the mid-line of tire. Regardless, this young man said it couldn't be patched and that I needed to buy a new tire. I didn't argue because I knew differently since my dad works on cars and I had already sent him a picture of the situation. I thanked the jerk for his time and drove off. \n\nA few miles down the road, I stopped at Woodies. I told the front desk guy there about my situation and he said they would take a look. My tire was patched and I was back on the road in 30 minutes. I will be doing a separate review for the great service I received at Woodies. \n\nThis type of treatment is inexcusable and I have no qualms with denouncing the entire company until they deal with their dishonest employees. He tried to \""screw\"" me over. Bad move buddy."
1,"Delicious rolls, amazing service! We took my 2 year old niece and they were very accommodating and even brought her food out right away. Prices were very reasonable. Most definitely will be back again!"
0,"Took the family to this particular Red Lobster for my oldest son's birthday (he wanted Red Lobster).  We usually go to the S. Alma School location, but decided to try this one.  Big mistake!  We entered and the hostess was not very friendly, and was rolling her eyes about something when we greeted her.  We waited the 15-20 mins to be seated, no biggy.  We get seated and the waitress comes by for our drink order.  We get drinks and take a few to decide our order, and this is when the fun started.  The waitress never mentions specials, etc so as we order I ask for a particular item that she states is popular and that is why they're out of it.  I make a choice on something else, but this could have been avoided by a simple explanation of specials and a \""by the way, we are out of this\""  So we get our slads and biscuits and it seemed to be ok.  Now our order arrives, me and my sons get our orders, my wife gets a portion of what is supposed to be served as an entree in appetizer form.  The waitress explains here are these shrimps, the grilled take longer, it's my fault but it should be up in 2 minutes.  Ok, 10 minutes later, the grilled shrmp skewer is brought out, no sides that are supposed to be with them.  The waitress asks did you want me to bring those out?  Really?  With a little bit of an attitude I might add.  My wife then asks to speak to  a manager.  He comes over about 5-7 minutes later, which makes me think he may have over camplaints.  He was very nice and comped her meal and my son's dessert.  The 2 stars are for him making her order right,  It will be a long time, if ever we go back there due to some piss poor attitudes by people that should be working in a toll booth rather than dealing in the service industry."

0,"The food is as standard as you can get with a chain restaurant. Service, however, is so-so.  Our waitress was friendly, however, from our booth, we could also hear the staff's conversations in the back kitchens.\n\nUnfortunately, a guest had complications on the night we ate here and they had to call an ambulance. We found it odd for some of the staff to be insensitive that a guest needed an ambulance.\n\nOverall, the food itself is consistent. The staff experience will keep us away for another 6 months until we come back to this place again."
1,"It was good.  I'm not going to spend too much time reviewing as my sentiments have been expressed over and over in these reviews.\n\nGreat burger for an exuberant price.  I had the Rising Sun which is probably the most unique burger on the menu with tempura fried avocado slices, a \""teriyaki\"" which was more of a Korean bulgogi type of sauce, crispy onions and a fried egg which I added manually.  Great burger, but nothing that blew my pants off.\n\nI sat at the bar and the bartender was on top of things.  She was very attentive and always had my drink refilled.  This was an off hour however and I was like one of maybe 15 people in the restaurant.\n\n\nI still prefer Burger Bar to all of the other burger joints on the strip."
0,Drove from queen creek to meet out of town friends here. This place was recommended to them by a local hotel.  After a 35 minute drive we waited 40 minutes for 6 wings to come out. After another 10 minutes we got another 6 wings.  After another 15 minutes we waited and finally got one of our 2 pizzas. Our order was finally complete to our table after an hour . The wings were just ok. We liked that they offered different flavors.  The pizza was horrible. It tasted like a soggy tontinos pizza. Good priced. Great service. The people were very respectful and friendly.
1,"Just had dinner with my husband, my parents, and my in-laws last night! We were fortunate to have dinner in there wine cellar in the basement. It was very intimate with all the wine bottles around our table and candles lit around the room. Four of us ordered the famous Chocolate Espresso rubbed pork tenderloin which definitely lived up to its reputation. Very flavorful and savory! My mother ordered the Buttermilk Chicken with sweet potatoes and it was a great down home cooking, stick to your ribs dish that you would remember from home. The green chile stew was my husbands favorite. It had a slight kick to it, but was very tender with the perfect blend of spices. \n\nOur server was fantastic and had great wine and menu recommendations. Which we followed and were not disappointed. If you are looking for authentic Southwestern cuisine this is the place!"
1,"just from a \""tourist\""'s point of view...this is one of the hotels i love visiting in vegas.  their decor is amazing...from the realistic sky to the backdrop of italian boutiques.  it was photo galore!!\n\ni definitely took many pics here.\n\nnext time, i'll stay here and maybe try the gondola ride--it looks ultra romantico!!"
1,"This place looks like it's a million years old, but the service and food are awesome.  \n\nHad the eggs benedict, the they throw on some kind of seasoning that's like paprika and parsley over everything.  Tasted real yum.  Their potatoes are off the hook.  Banana nut bread is really good, pumpkin is ok.  Waffle is nice and large, too.  There is a lobster version of eggs benedict which is supposed to be the bomb but I have a seafood allergy so no thanks.\n\nBe careful of how much you order - don't order 3-4 things like I do even if they sound/look good.  Great for a bunch of hungry guys.  Not far from strip.  Travelers will feel welcome.\n\nBig parking lot."
1,"The best cocktails in Phoenix. Great back patio to sit and sip an amazing drink.  The ingredients of each drink are very thought out. No fake sugary mixes are used. At times it  seems like and uppity crowd but that doesn't matter once you try a cocktail.  Sit back, chill and listen to some reggae. The Tamarind Ball and the Handcart are my favorite drinks."
0,"More fat than meat.  Had spicy chicken & beef combo.  Flavor was good, but quality of meat was as bad as it gets.  I asked for recommendation when I ordered, I can't imagine anything worse.  I will need to go someplace else to eat, only 25% of the meat was edible.  Other reviews must have been written by owners or workers there.  Unable to recommend this to anyone but the family dog."
1,"I live in the neighborhood of this restaurant and have been avoiding in due to a string of bad restaurants in place before it.  Additionally, the outside looks like a regular 'ol diner.  I was mistaken!  It's cute inside, almost modern d\u00e9cor with enough 'diner' feel to know you should order breakfast.\n\nOn a Saturday morning, my boyf and I strolled in for some eggs and bacon.  It was busy, but we only waited about five minutes.  I ordered an omelette with spinach, bacon and mushroom- it was HUGE and stuffed with ingredients, not just all eggs and a few bits of spinach- I was impressed.  I could only eat half and took the rest home for yummies later.  It came with whole wheat toast (ya! for another option besides 'white') and they have local jam that was super delish!\n\nMy boyf ordered the French toast, which gets a lot of attention.  It's lightly fried, and he could not have been happier, as it also came with bacon and two eggs!  I tried the French toast, quite different from your usual soggy bread French toast with great flavor.\n\nPrice was reasonable.  Service was attentive and fast.\n\nWe will be back and definitely want to try the lunch menu, too!"
0,For the second Sunday in a row.......no newspaper!    Plus a couple other times this month during the week.  So what is their response when I called???   If you refer a friend you get a. $25.00 Amazon gift card for the referral!   Really?   All I want is the newspaper I prepay for!   What a joke.  Still waiting for my paper.  It would have been faster if I went and paid for the second one of the day.   Terrible customer service!
0,"As a bonafide half mexican-american hahaa..I want 4 things from my carne asada 1.grilled charred taste  2.tenderness  3.a hint of citrus  4.proper accompaniments\n\nAmerica's carne asada is NOT the best carne asada in Phoenix, not even today, on National Taco Day.  \n\nNo need for anyone to suffer the same disapponting let down, not to mention the total rip-off, that occurred tonight.  Spent $3.50 on a bottle of mexican Coke and $1.50 on a can of Coke.  $5.00 on drinks at a freaking taco shop is ridiculous.  I will say America's carne is tender and has the charred grilled taste, but that is where it ends, INCOMPLETE.  On a good tortilla, they serve their carne tacos with a stingy 1oz of salsa (not hot), grilled onions (wtf), guac, and lettuce (again wtf).  You have to douse it youself by squeezing the entire life out of your lime half, and even then it doesn't have enough flavor.  The meat is lacking its perfect marriage to sharper onion flavor,cilantro,hotter salsa.\n\nThat being said, don't go to America's, please.  Let the weirdos who think this place is the greatest support America's.  Oh and they also let people smoke on their patio...MMM smoke and weak carne in my mouth was tasty..nooot.  Trek about 7 miles north and you will find the best carne asada in Phoenix.  Funny how the restaurants that actually have the best carne asada in Phoenix are on the same street, yet are way out of the imaginary ballpark, of great carne asada that America thinks she is in.  Go to 7th Street & Mountain View.  Mountain View is just south of Peoria Ave.\n\nBest carne asada street tacos = Tacos Jalisco (nw corner)\n\nBest carne asada burrito = Vaqueros (sw corner behind CircleK)\nPERIOD"
0,I went there with my fiance and some out-of-town friends (all are vegans/vegetarians to varying degrees) and everyone thought there was just something lacking about the food. One of us ordered the sampler - the portions were so tiny that it was a very unsatisfying  meal for the price. Two people ordered the BBQ Tempeh and both were disappointed with the flavor - the sauce tasted more like tomato paste than any bbq I'd ever had. Another person ordered the Seed Crusted Oyster mushrooms which ended up being the most flavorful dish although the mushrooms themselves were tough and chewy. \nI love the idea of raw food so I'll give this place another chance. Let's hope they work out some of the kinks in the menu by then!
0,"Very disappointed Sunday.  We were a party of six and no one walked away satisfied.  The quality of the food has really taken a turn for the worse.  Seems like everything is precooked, frozen and reheated.   This was my favorite Italian restaurant."

They  also forced her to recount events that happened several years ago, which threw her into a full-blown panic attack/PTSD attack. They still wouldn't allow me back there with her. So if you care about your loved ones at all, don't bother with this place."
1,"I went to @SwitchWineBar for the @Dine4AZ #Dine4AZTweetUp. I previously went as part of the Light Rail Pub Crawl, and was not very impressed.\n\nI am now a fan. $3 Italian Drunken Sodas, $3 Caipirinhas, and a great spread of food.\n\nThey had a turkey sandwich, with fresh, handmade strawberry jam, that was so delicious, and reminded me of a Monte Cristo, but not fried. I could eat one of these every day!\n\nThe location is very convenient for light rail, and is close enough to downtown.\n\nThe beer selection was \""ok, the drunken italian soda was really nice, and sneaks up on you, but the Caipirinhas were simply fantastic.\n\nI'm thinking I may have to try their brunch, before I make a solid determination about our future together.\n\nBut I really enjoyed the TweetUp, and my impression of Switch moved up quite a bit."
1,"This is almost always our first stop of the night.  Super sexy dancers and very sexy vibe.  The bartenders pour some stiff drinks with lots of flair.  Going to get soaked for drinks no matter what, so might as well be entertained while you are at it, right?!\n\nBack to the dancers...:)  They are mesmerizing.  The last time we were there, we actually saw the dancers in the bar before they went on stage. Seems like they start dancing at 9pm."
1,"This place is great and one of our typical stops on the weekend.  One great thing about them is that they have live music every weekend! They are almost always great bands.  They also have an amazing beer selection of over 60 beers on tap! The only thing that really brings it down to a four star is that it can get a bit expensive! Their beers generally range from $5-8 and only some local beers apply to happy hour. Their Happy hour is from 3-6, with great deals on their appetizers and pizzas. Their food is also delicious! Try the nachos."
0,"Good coffee, employees were nice, but not somewhere I'd go to sit and drink it.  I went to the patio to do some work on my laptop, and couldn't concentrate with the bad music played too loudly through low quality speakers.\n\nFor me, it's definitely a takeout, not a hangout."
1,"I've been to Anthem more since this store opened than I have since the entire outlet mall opened. The sales are just sick -- once in a while, the entire store is 40% off. If you sign up for the emails, they send all kinds of crazy coupons. The clothes, admittedly, aren't as nice as the regular BR, but the overall flavor is very similar for a tiny fraction of the price. Last weekend, I got a pair of work dress pants, two chiffon tie-neck tops, a very expensive looking cowl neck top, and a button down shirt for my SO -- for about $115. That's insane!"
0,"Today I chose Five Guys for lunch. I believe this place is a chain burger place like In-and Out. At least it has that feel when you enter the restaurant. My choose was a bacon burger with lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion,mustard. No fries as I don't need the calories. The burger comes with two pieces of meat. From all appearance it looked like a very good burger. To my surprise it had very little taste. All the makings was there but no taste. \nBut then I have been spoiled from eating at Rocket Burger."
1,"Service: 5 star\nFood: 1 Star (redeemed by their Vietnamese fare else negative)\nMom and Pop store: Check\nPrice: Cheap\n= 4 star\n\nI would have given this  a 2 star at most if it wasn't for the service. Their Chinese Kung pao was dreadful (sweet and tough chicken). I should have stuck with the Vietnamese spread (but had pre-ordered from their online menu). The service was really good and the place was really clean and almost \""American\"" diner looking."
0,"I ordered shrimp tempura and sushi assortment.  The fish, shrimp quality is good, but the portion is small and there sushi ratio is kind of wrong: too much rice, too thin, too little fish.  I was also surprised that the tuna piece was seared, not raw as it should be.     Service is very good, but I won't go there again."
0,We ate the dinner buffet here about an hour before closing. I was not impressed with the quality of the food for the price. The only thing really noteworthy were the desserts. Perhaps lunch is a better option. I would not return again for dinner though.
1,We always find deals when we come to this outlet center. Stopped at the Dickie store and found great shorts for $9.99 a pair.
0,"Things are everywhere.  Bad selection on home decorations and barely anything for the bathrooms.  OH well, need to go to the another Ross."
1,"I like my doctor (Dr. Hazelrigg) here and the staff are very nice! I'm always informed about things I should know, such as how long tests run, fasting or non fasting, when my doctor will be out of town, what vaccines are recommended. They are highly concerned of how their patients are doing. I enjoy coming here for my schedule appointment. Most of the time I get seen right away. One time I had to wait ten minutes but I was completely fine with it. They allow a person to accompany you if you like. And they have their own lab there so you don't have run somewhere else to get blood drawn!!!"
1,"BEST POPCORN i've ever had!! Yeah someone said that it's just the right amount of flavoring...yummy and delicious. Move over Garrett's, i was in line for 45 mins and was disappointed, just a regular popcorn. With Dyers, i'll get in line even for an hour!!! Thanks Carl for letting us in, even if you're close Monday, we didnt know :)  We'll be back, congratulations to you and your wife, great idea!!!  Maria & Mel"
0,OMG!!! We just came from this place and it was the worst ever.  I give two stars cause our waitress Kerri was very sweet and the busboy was nice.  I ordered orange juice and it tasted like the the film from the dishwasher detergent was still in the glass so I sent it back and the busboy brought me a new glass.  Then my husband gets his food and the eggs were to be scrambled and they were so runny and very undercooked so he put them aside and ate everything else on his plate. Then he is on his second cup of coffee and he looks down into the glass and there is a fly floating on top.  We were glad to get the heck out there.
0,"Long wait at lunch. 5 min just to acknowledge I was waiting. Hostess running table tickets, takeout orders and seating tables.\n\nStrange when I'm already eating with chopsticks the server comes over to ask if I want a fork??? WTH? I wonder what kind of reaction I'd get asking a group of Asians eating with forks if they'd like chopsticks?\n\nOrdered beef and broccoli. Tried to substitute fried rice for the steamed rice but no can do. Hint people. Figure out how much additional the same amount of fried rice is and ADD THE ADDITIONAL CHARGE. Telling a customer no you can't do it will ensure one thing: the customer goes somewhere they will. Try visiting other restaurants and see how they do it.\n\nSo I got my lunch they way they wanted me to have it. Result? Loss of additional revenue and an unhappy customer. I guess not all business owners actually have business sense.\n\nTwo stars only because the food is good. Not great, but good. The service and flexibility to the customer is substandard."
0,"Two things Mineo's taught me:\n1) There is such thing as too much cheese.\n2) Some pizza slices really do need to be blotted.  Normally, I roll my eyes when people blot their pizza--what's pizza without some grease?--but Mineo's slices are an exception. \n\nThe sauce here is pretty good, but as is the case with the cheese, there's too much of it.  I've burned my finger holding down the cheese as I bite into my slice so I don't end up pulling off all of it.  I thought the crust leaned towards being a little too crispy.\n\nI like the paneled walls and the framed photos--check out the Life magazine cover of young Molly Ringwald.  But I don't come to a pizza place for ambiance, so it's not enough to keep me from looking at other places for a superior slice."
1,Decent inexpensive pizza in my neighborhood. $14.00 for a large pepperoni and they have a pretty tasty dough. Specials are like large 1 topping pizza with 24 wings for $22.00.
0,"The chicken was dry & very salty. The waffles were fairly bland. The service was lousy too. If you love salty, sugary, high saturated fat items you may enjoy this restaurant. I'd prefer to clogg my arteries else where, thank you!"
0,"We ordered Calamari, Ravioli Carbonara and just some simple Chicken Alfredo and paid almost $45.00 for it all.  After trying our food we decided that it is WAY over-priced for the quality of the food.  I was very disappointed because I love authentic Italian food.  Tthe food wasn't bad, there was just absolutely no flavor to judge it by."
0,"I've been to really good Spanish/tapas restaurants in major cities. For Madison, this used to be a restaurant I enjoyed going to with friends. In fact, I spent one of my birthdays here six years ago. I don't know what happened between then and now, but the quality of food has completely deteriorated. \n\nIn short: the food was bland and disgusting. There were no croquetas, which is a classic and basic Spanish tapas. The \""grilled\"" calamari tasted like it had been thrown in boiling water and nothing else. The shrimp was overcooked and overpriced--two large shrimp (no garlic olive oil, which, again is the classic gambas al ajillo dish) for $15. Lol.  My friend and I were appalled. To make matters worst, the bartender lacked any couth. \n\nNeedless to say, I will not be returning. To detox the horrible culinary experience from our system, we ended up going a block down the street to Centeno--much better service, ambiance, and quality of food. \n\nIf you've never had tapas, do not deceive yourself into thinking this is anything close."
1,"Today's visit was probably the shortest amount of time I've spent at this place for a haircut. I might have lucked out w my appointment time because there weren't many clients in the lobby nor in stylist chairs. \n\nMy stylist was prompt and friendly when she greeted me and gave me the exact cut I wanted (with a little assistance from an instructor). \n\nBefore checking out at the front desk I informed my stylist I was looking for a product that would deliver a certain hold and she was able to direct me to a liquid gel that I purchased right away, slapped some on, and love it!"
1,"For a group of four people, this was ideal. Very clean room with two comfortable fold-away beds.\n\nThe guys liked the scandalous outfits on the drink girls with the dance interludes, and the girls liked the Starbucks shops inside so we could suck down iced green teas at all hours.\n\nCalled for extra towels one morning and within five minutes there was a guy knocking on the door with a whole stack. \n\nBut no microwave. \n\nFREE SHUTTLE to sister casinos, which meant we could get to the strip for free. Nice. A little smoky, and a little trashy, but, well, what do you expect?"
0,"We went there at 1:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon and the service was AWFUL!!  We ordered the Italian salad and a pizza. It took them 50 minutes to get our food out to us!   There were people who ordered after us who were getting their lunch.  The place was not busy.  I finally asked if they had lost our ticket, the server was very rude and just said we had a sudden rush.  What?  There were 4 tables outside with people and at the most 5 inside!  I ordered my dressing on the side and of course it came saturated with it along with wilted lettuce!  The pizza was just ok, nothing spectacular.  If you want a GREAT salad and pizza, drive 5 minutes south to Oregano's.  I was very disappointed because the atmosphere was so modern and great!  So, in a nut shell!  The atmosphere is GREAT, the service is lousy and the food is not even \""ok\"". My guess is with all of the places that have great service and excellent food that this place will not be around much longer.  Not even in the same realm as Postino's or LG Orange."
1,"Had the cilantro jalape\u00f1o hummus. It was amazing!\n\nThe amount of hummus was too much for the two warm pieces of pita bread, which means I get leftovers!\n\nI have enjoyed my experience every time I have been to Pita Jungle. I don't live close, but I will probably go back."
0,"Went there to get eyebrows cleaned up. She did a terrible job, to where I needed to go somewhere else to get them done right.  Beware if you use your debit card. I did, but then noticed after I put in my pin that there is a surveillance camera pointed DIRECTLY at the keypad. Fortunately I always cover the keypad with my other hand anyway, but I'm sure many don't think about it. Not saying that something shady is going on, but I am over careful about protecting my personal info, and everyone else should be also, so it just turned me off to the place."
0,"You're not going to Panda for excellent food.  At least for me, you stop here when you don't have much time.   My last visit here a few months ago left a bad taste in my mouth and will never go back.  The entire staff behind the counter were picking apart the customers in Spanish.   I guess I looked Hispanic enough which I am so their comments about me were made after I left.  This is horrible!  Shame on you for making fried rice with brown rice now!"
1,"The wife and I were looking for something low-key and random to do on Halloween so we gave this place a try.  It was pretty early (8ish) so the place wasn't very busy at all.  That was a good thing because this ensured we could sit wherever we wanted and there was nobody playing that shuffleboard game thing they have.  I LOVE that game!  We had a few reasonably priced drinks while we played then ordered some burgers.  Their burger selection is surprisingly good with tons of topping to choose from.  You really wouldn't expect it from a \""dive\"" bar.\n\nOur burgers were big and juicy and tasted excellent.  I don't think they were pre-made and frozen, but if they were, kudos to the defroster!\n\nThe service was excellent as our waitresses were fast and friendly.  For some reason we had 3 different waitresses during the 3 or so hours were were there, but it was ok.  I have to give a shout out to the waitress that took our food order because she brought me a pitcher of diet coke so I could refill it myself.  AWESOME!!  When I eat I somehow drink tons of diet coke and it is always a pain for the waitress to keep on refilling and a pain to wait for another one.  Anyway, we didn't even get to that point because she brought the pitcher right away.  It was like she knew me!  Very impressive!\n\nThe price was very reasonable for what we ordered and we had fun.  It seems like most of the people who hang out there are regulars so they are pretty friendly.  We even made some new friends when they challenged us to shuffleboard for drinks.  Good stuff!!"
1,Food here is always amazing. This is the only Indian restaurant that I will come to. Korma Chicken and Methi Chicken are my favorites!!
0,This place has huge potential but it's very inconsistent. Almost every time we order food for take out we get it home and it's wrong. We aren't even asking for modifications. We often order the spot chicken sandwich. Menu says it has bacon on it. This is the 3rd time we've gotten it and there's no bacon on the sandwiches. The lettuce on the sandwiches is wilted. Another favorite in theory is the classic summer salad. Great when the chicken is good. Not so much when the chicken is overcooked to the point of not being able to chew it. I really want to like this place because I love the concept and the tasty recipes but not sure how many more chance we are willing to give it.
0,Worst service ever
1,"St John's is not your average church.  With a prime location right in the centre of town, at the West corner of Princes Street, it is at once a traditional centre of worship with an active Scottish Episcopal congregation, and also a hub for activism and progressive enterprise in Edinburgh.  \n\nHome to the Peace and Justice Centre and the ethical One World shop and also a Christian bookshop, which are all tucked around the side of the building, the church is also the primary venue for the Festival of Peace and Spirituality in August, which attracts speakers from all around the world for inter-faith dialogue.  There are also numerous concerts and talks held there throughout the year, and an occasional arts and crafts market that springs up on the terrace at the back.\n\nAll in all, St John's has plenty of interesting things to offer Christians and non-Christians alike."
1,"Great for kids and adults.  I recommend coming during the week and not the weekend.  \n\nThe peanut and I had a great time!  A lot of great exhibits and there definitely is something for everyone.  Peanut didn't care for the robot exhibit but loved the fish - we were even there while a fish was laying eggs!  Never saw anything like that before.  We went during the day, during the week and that was perfect!  The Sports exhibit didn't have too much for a 4 yo so I'd suggest saving that one for an older kiddo."
0,"All I have to say is what you see on the menu is not what you're gonna get. and if you're ok with cockroaches on the walls and floors, the this is the place to eat."
0,"Incorrect assumptions are bad, good customer service assumes the customer knows what kind of insurance they have."
1,"The hype is real. I just went here with my parents and we were not disappointed! Wait was long as always, even for a Sunday night at 850pm. However, we got seated at the bar and ordered our drinks first. Thai teas all around of course! Service is pretty darn good here, they sat us down and made sure we got our orders in quickly. Things I would recommend ordering:\n\n1) Crispy duck Penang curry (pricey at $24/dish) the skin is so crispy and the duck is cooked to perfection. I personally think the curry is too creamy but for those that love a coconut base curry, this is a must for you! \n2) Garlic prawns - gahhh damn it's good. They peel the skin but keep it semi attached to the meat of the shrimp so that you get the crunch of both. \n3) Veggie tom yum soup - the perfect combo of spicy and sour. \n4) Pad Thai - pretty good, but not their best dish. But I think it's cuz the other dishes I can't get else where as good! \n\nWish they would expand and bring this to SoCal! But this place is a must for every Vegas trip. Bill came out to be 85 including tip! Pretty good for the quality of food you get."
0,"They had the cheapest tires around, but I won't go here for ANYTHING else. They didn't call me when my tires came in, wouldn't set an appointment or return my calls forcing me to repeatedly call them, they were pushy and rude about things I didn't need, told them I didn't want, and flat out refused to pay for. Next time I'll just buy the tires and get them installed somewhere else, \""free\"" installation or not.  The only reason this is getting two stars instead of one is that the very last time I came in, the people working were polite, quoted me a time and stuck to it, and didn't lie to my face about work my car \""needed\""."
1,Best prices and superb service. Got my oil changed in 15 min!!! Most trustworthy shop.
1,"I came in with my fiance for a birthday dinner and had a great time.  \nFor those of you who don't know, if you sign up on their email list, you get a certificate for $30 you can use during your birthday month.  It's a GREAT deal!\n\nPretty funny, but it seemed like half the people there were celebrating a birthday.\n\nThe staff is very kind here, and works very fast.  The food is delicious, and their Happy Hour goes until 7:30 PM, with great food/drink specials.  Our Chef Toshi was nice enough.  I'm sure they all have different personalities, but he did a good job.\n\nIf you haven't been here yet, sign up for the birthday coupon and come check it out.  \nENJOY!"
1,"We love staying on fremont street when we come to vegas, but the stores on fremont leave much to be diesired.  My husband and I discovered the container park. We just love it, being small business owners ourselves we liked that we were supporting small businesses. We also were able to grab perfect non Las Vegas gifts for our employees! Each gift we found here suited each person!  The shops prices were reasonable for unique items.  As a tourist I didn't think the area was shady at all.  I could possibly see someone from a rural area being a bit turned off, but being from a large urban area I know it's not that bad of an area."
1,"Don't let the rustic decor (and the fact that the restaurant is in Gila Bend) fool you!... The food has homemade flair and is simply great. Homemade tortillas and the burritos are enormous!\n\nRode my motorcycle out there for breakfast last week with friends, and the staff knew we were there from out of town, and went out of their way to say \""Thanks.\""\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is quite small, but they have covered picnic tables outside...\n\nI will definitely be back!"
1,"I can't understand all the negative reviews for Macayos in Goodyear. YES, for those that don't already know this, Macayos is a chain. It's a family owned chain and as far as I know, they're only here in Arizona, centered around the Phoenix area. They've been in business many years.\n\nMy family loves Macayos, and we've been to several. I just ate at the one in Goodyear today for lunch - I had a colleague in from out of town and he was up for some Mexican food, and he said he enjoyed it. We both had the Chimi Macayos, with shredded beef, rice and beans (lunch comes with one or the other but you can add the other for a buck or two). \n\nTheir chips are good, the salsa is good (not great, I admit, but good) and they serve portions large enough to satisfy any hunger. Seriously, if you eat here and leave hungry, you're one in a thousand.\n\nThey have a nice bar area, and on Friday and Saturday nights it gets pretty busy. The dining room is good sized and they can accommodate large groups. Which is good, because we often go there with a dozen or more family members.\n\nThey also have a very good line of margaritas, by the way."
0,"Absolutely horrendous company.  AC broke down Thursday night, called Friday morning- they had only a Monday availability.  Turns out, the repairman said he was free on Saturday!!! Not only that, now, they want to re-diagnose and come out again- on Thursday, A WEEK WITH NO AC IN LAS VEGAS!  The dispatchers are horrible, serve is horrible, expect nothing but the worst if you have to use them.. I plan on canceling my First American Home Buyers Protection Warranty as well."
0,Painfully long lines in the early afternoon on a regular weekday...all for a large container of glitter.
0,"So they put craisins in their guacamole, that doesn't justify the price.  If you are going here for a meal for two with drinks, appetizers, and dessert, It's going to be expensive and not worth it."
1,"The Yelpers are right and so is my uncle... Chalet is some awesome montreal chicken.  The gravy is fantastic and so are the fries.  I even ate coleslaw, and I don't even like coleslaw!  5 stars for a meal under $10!"
1,"Bragg's Pie Factory is a pretty amazing place.  Right in the heat of Grand Ave's eclectic art scene this former confection creation station is now a very cool, very open and airy art space.\n\nI rented the space for a modest sum to throw a party there for the Phoenix Fringe Festival's closing night and it couldn't have gone better.  There is currently a mutant pinata show going on (stop by, you can see it from the street!) and that made for a really fun vibe for the party.  The owner, Beatrice (go visit her at Kooky Krafts up the street) was very accommodating and positive about the whole experience.  Beatrice is an energy all her own on Grand Ave., really working to reuse and rehab the marvelous old buildings from Phoenix's former main-drag.\n\n The building itself is a giant open front room with other, similarly large back rooms which house local businesses.  The front room, the one we rented, is about a football field in size, stark white with polished concrete floors.  It feels big when you're in it, but we were able to use some select lighting (Xmas lights are your friend) to make the space somewhat intimate.\n\nRock on Pie Factory, rock on."
0,"Had been to Macayo's in the Phoenix area countless time, but today on our Dive bar tour . . . we decided to stop in for lunch . . . One BIG Mistake.\n\nThe service was terrible . . . the server took our drink order . . . and THREE bowls of chips and salsa later . . . she was back with the drinks and took our order.  Another two bowls of chips later . . . the food arrived.  Problem was . . . it was COLD and GREASY.\n\nSaving grace was that we ate enough chips to fill up . . . we definitely not be back."
0,"***Ciao Ciao's gelato is pretty good but also very overpriced (even for Las Vegas)***\n\nCiao Ciao is a gelato bar inside The Forum Shops at Caesars.  They have a good number of flavors and many of them appeared to be creative concoctions with lots of ingredients mixed in.  I went with the pistachio and the mascarpone with caramel and both flavors were good.  The gelato was creamy too.\n\nService was quick and pleasant.\n\nPricing was very high.  I ordered a medium size and it was $8 before taxes.  While I did not get the gelato at the more famous Jean Philippe in Aria, I think the gelato there was about the same price (maybe even less at Jean Philippe).\n\nCiao Ciao's gelato was a satisfying frozen dessert.  Pricing was too high though.  Pricing is high for a lot of stuff in Vegas, but I think for the prices you will pay here, you should be able to find more interesting and more well known sweets elsewhere.\n\nThe Forum Shops and Caesars offer complimentary parking (via valet or self parking structure)."
0,I ate here before going to see Dennis Miller.  I enjoyed the chef action and the interesting cooking station but didn't enjoy the food so much.  The oysters were kinda meh and the oyster shooters were disgusting.  My clam linguine was excellent but there was way too much of it.  They mention this on the menu but I didn't believe them.\n\nI'd have to say that there aren't too many choices at Orleans but I'd go to Canal St. next time.
0,"This review might sound a little repetitive but I feel future customers need to hear it again and again...\n\nThey really offer you nothing for your jewelry. I went there with a Cartier ring and a custom made necklace. I was offered less than the weight of the gold. I understand that they need to make money to stay in business, but damn don't take us for the ride of our lives! Just to confirm my suspicions, I drove down the street to one of those pawn superstores for giggles and they offered me more for the necklace alone than that jewelry store.\n\nBottom line, know what you have before selling it, no matter where you go! And this is certainly not the place to go to if you want to walk away with some decent cash in your pocket."
1,"Courteous, helpful and knowledgable about their products. Can sometimes feel a bit pushy about products. Enormous and magnificient collection of hats and scarfs, however small collection of gloves, but all of very good quality. Highly recommended if you are ready for quality. Stay away if not."
0,"Spent my 40th birthday stay (Sept. 2012) at TI and had a decent time though I've had more fun at other resorts. TI's rooms are spacious and clean and their housekeeping was top notch. I had zero issues with the room my entire 6-day stay there. Buffet was ordinary but I did like some of the drink choices at the various bars. There's a really good pizza place near Mysterie Theatre but it closes early which makes no sense being that it's Vegas. 99% of my late-night eating was done at other resorts. Casino was ok. Won $50 at blackjack one day, lost it the next. I was there the opening weekend of the college football season so there seemed to be a lot of UNLV fans there, which was cool. They were all fun people. I did not see Mysterie but instead went across the street to see La Reve at The Wynn. The underlying theme of my birthday stay at TI was that most of my adventures were done elsewhere. The Syrens show was interesting the first time then got tiring every time you walk by it for a week. I'd probably stay there again ONLY if I got a discounted room which I got from the booking agent because it was my birthday."
0,"I've attended this spa a few times before. I adore the Aesthetician, Julie, she's amazing. By the end of my facial my skin felt clean and I was 100% relaxed and falling asleep. I got the deal through Living Social so I also had an hour massage that I was greatly looking forward to. The massage therapist I got was blind and her name is Evon. I had let Evon know that I was extremely sensitive to the touch and that she need not use a lot of pressure--she ignored this and really ripped at my skin. It was a very uncomfortable situation all together. The oils that she used on my back were strongly scented and burned my skin. The massage lasted about 10-15 minutes before I just couldn't take it any longer. I told her that I needed to excuse myself to go to the bathroom. She grabbed the robe off the back of the door, opened the door and held the robe close to her. I couldn't reach it (informed her so) and was left having to cover my breast with my hands and go for the robe. Evon's Husband was sitting right outside the door. I saw him immediately. It was immensely embarrassing. I left the room and saw the Aesthetician, Julie. I told her what was going on and that my massage was horrible and asked what I should do about the matter. She told me that she would take care of it. Julie did indeed take care of it in the most professional manner I've seen from this salon. I was immediately taken into her room where she cleaned my back. Told me that the Spa would reschedule me for a full massage for another time and that she was deeply sorry for the unpleasant experience. \nWhen I called to reschedule, Pam (the manager), said that I'd be receiving a 20-30 minute massage and pretty much that she would not honor that agreement. I carefully explained the full detail of events and occrences, as well as my several (costly visits) to their spa While some of the staff is very friendly and pleasant the Manager has no intentions of taking care of their guests and because of Pam's terrible service I will never return or recommend this spa again which is a shame because Julie, the woman who did my facial, is awesome."
0,"Joined on a groupon, went once and never went back.  Gym equipment was so old it brought back memories of the 70s.  \nTennis courts filled with rug rats and people who did not want to give way to anyone else wanting to hit.  Heated pool, big deal can crash a local resort hotel for that.  My expectations were not met, very disappointed."
0,"The food was not oily which is good. However, it lacks taste. To make matter worse, it was extremely salty. The decor was light and the place was clean. None of the above matters if the food is not good. I will not go back again."
0,"Nice new location in Town Square. Meatball Spot is a new concept in dining. Meatballs are the entree and you order sides to go along with them. I tried three different meatballs and they were all good. The Vegetarian at the table said her veggie meatballs were dry and not that great. Caesar salad over dressed with a not so tasty caesar dressing. Didn't eat it. Bread was horrible and they don't offer garlic bread. Side of pasta was small, but good and not pricey. Sangria was like no other I have ever tasted - and not in a good way - too sweet. Server was knowledgable about the food, but once the order was taken she never checked back on us. Hostess were dressed nice and the uniforms for the servers and managers looked sloppy. It would help giving the servers a waiters apron around their waste. interior design is very well done. \n\nOne of the owners Steve Davidovici (Stevie D) was there barking orders to everyone in site - this was very annoying to us and the guests around us. He was loud, rude and lacked any people skills dealing with staff. We mentioned this to him and he was so shocked we said anything, he abruptly turned around and walked away without saying one word. I was in the restaurant business 15 years and I have never seen a reaction to a customer complaint like this. Very unprofessional Stevie D!\n\nChef Carla was seen walking around the restaurant but not stopping at any of the tables to find out how they were enjoying the food. Some of the recipes still need to be tweaked.\n\nThey need to bring in an experienced front of the house manager with good training and people skills to get the servers where they need to be. The Kitchen should be asking for feedback when it comes to the food."
0,This is not a good spot if you like clean modern hotel rooms. I upgraded to an executive suite and the couch is so nasty as well the ceiling has the popcorn style. If I didn't already change one room today I would actually ask to be changed again. This is more of a large motel.
0,"I really wanted to like this place since it is new and a family business. \nMy first day I walked in and a kid took off running from laying on the couch. A few minutes later some one comes out to help me. (I should of just took my stuff and went somewhere else after that) I dropped 2 blouses off and noticed they also fixed shoes. Came to pick up my blouses after the \""ready\"" date and only one was ready. I dropped off a shoe which I was told would be ready in a week. A week in a half later my boot isn't ready but my other blouse finally is. They say my shoe should be ready by Friday so I go Tuesday, still not ready. Long story short it took a month to get my shoe and every time I'd come in they would tell me it was ready and they were going to go pick it up. When it was finally ready they had a kid working the store who had no clue what he was doing."
1,"Great cafe to hang out in, work in and generally spend your day. Friendly staff and great coffee."
1,My family has been eating here for 13 years. We come from New Mexico and our Mexican food is different. We love it here...almost like home. The patio is amazing for margaritas any time. They are half priced for happy hour :)
0,"I like the Fitchburg HyVee, but I hate this one. Something always goes wrong. Either we get prepackaged food and it's terrible or they don't have what we want. Either way, my boyfriend and I have made a promise that we'll always take the extra time to go to the Fitchburg location."
0,"This place is 10 minutes from my house and very convenient. My family either orders food to go or we go in and eat. The last several times (at least 4) that we've ordered, our meal has been messed up. Either something was left out, or they added something that shouldn't be there.  I've called several times to let them know that the order was incorrect and have been told to \""just come back and we'll give you what was left off.\"" Even though it's only 10 minutes, I don't want to interrupt my meal to drive back and pick up the item. This means, they get money for something we didn't get. Well the last straw was this evening when they left off the salad and charged me for it and 2 meatballs, which was really one cut in half. When I called to complain, yet again I was told by the manager and I quote: \""do not argue with me, it is what it is. That is the way the meatball comes and if you really want the salad, come in and get it\"". Are you freaking kidding me... this is the way you treat a loyal customer!!?? I will NEVER again go in that restaurant and I've told all my family and friends. The food is not that great to begin with, and now the service is crap! I suggest you stay away from this place. if you want good pizza, try Casanova Brothers on Val Vista and Guadalupe in Gilbert... that's a 20 minute ride for me, but so worth it."
1,"Fantastic burgers, fantastic service...mixed fries with ketchup & aioli sauce is a must... \n\nI wish they had a larger menu selection however what they do offer they do it well...\n\nif in phx this is a must eat at lunch spot or late night grub."
0,i think this place is overrated....the food is never that good and the staff is and alwas has been kind of blah! avoid if ya can and save your money...its not cheap for a sandwich shop....go next door to the next place
0,"The weekend service at this DD location is absolutely AWFUL. On several occasions, during peak morning hours, I have waited in line with dozens of other customers while one very slow employee works at the counter and several others (including management) do nothing to help. The employees I have encountered on the weekends have no customer service skills either. No friendly greeting, very inattentive, no smile, no 'thank you' when you get your order. They look miserable and dress sloppily. And God forbid you ask for an item that is not in the racks behind them. I'm glad they don't have the nerve to put a tip jar out on the counter. It would be empty!!\n\nIn fairness to this store, there is one young lady who works mid-day during the week who is absolutely wonderful. (I wish I knew her name.) She is everything the weekend crew is not, and she should teach them a bit about customer service.\n\nIt is amazing how DD on the east coast is run so differently. You never wait in line more than 5 minutes, they greet you by name and know how you like your coffee. 'Light and sweet' is a legitimate request, and you always find the variety of product you go in for."
1,Great sports bar and grill. We called ahead for seating for 20 after a ballgame. The service was quick and friendly. The food was good. The nachos are huge! The Irish Stew is comfort food! The outside patio had our group set up in two big tables. It was a nice place to celebrate our winning game and enjoy fellowship with the team.
0,"Get Mad sub contracts out it jobs. The detailer showed up at me home, told my wife that the job would be an extra $30.00 because we had an SUV. Then when we told the detailer that we paid for the SUV upcharge on Groupon he said well your car is very dirty so it will still be a $30 additional fee! I called customer service to question how it was a charge for SUV then when we had that covereed all of a sudden it was because it was too dirty. Customer service said sorry thats how it goes."
0,They went out of business and kept our $$$$$$ that we had paid for a ride that never happened.  They sent an email promising to refund us but never did.  They don't return phone calls or emails.  I sure hope they never open another business.
0,"Friday night and only 7 tables full. Maybe because what is on the menu is not what they serve. We ordered the appetizer 'Artinasal cheeses with apples, grapes, and assorted crackers' for$12 - received water crackers (no assorted), 4 kinds of cheese (gouda, brie, pepperjack, a soft spreadable cheese), 2 strawberries, raisins, and honey. I could have gone to my local grocery store for this. Rest of the food was average. Not surprised this location has had so many different restaurants."
1,I am surrounded by people making yummy noises.  A couple next to me is on a mission to try every menu item.  This is my first time and I couldn't resist the curry wurst.  Schmeckt gut!  The rouladen at the table next to me looks amazing.  Now I'm on a mission to try every menu item!
0,"Old and outdated hotel, extremely uncaring and Non accommodating staff, terrible housekeeping and unpleasant all around. Will not stay here even for free..."
0,"If you go to this location, be prepared for a long wait! I have to echo previous comments in that the food is fine, but wait times are horrible! \n\nI have only been here twice and both times the drive thru wait was extremely long. I thought the first time might have just been a busy day for them, but then in my second trip it was the same terrible experience waiting. In this recent visit, I spent over 30 minutes in the drive thru! I would have left but I was blocked in so forced to wait over half an hour for 2 burgers. \n\nI won't be returning. There are two many burger places in close proximity that don't ave the service time issues I've experienced here."
0,"Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):\n5 Food\n4 Service\n5 Atmosphere\n4 Value\n\nAn uninspired menu w/ average barfood at best.  This place obviously doesn't serve anything that appears local, organic, original, creative, pretty, tasty, or cheap - and is more obviously just making its money by forcing itself upon a captive airport audience with no other choices.  Come on, you have to offer at least ONE of those things!  Boring boring boring place.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the service is bad, right?  Well, when I order a bottled beer and the server doesn't tell me that it's a 20 oz bottle, I'm calling bullshit.  So I see this 20 oz bottle come to me and I just sit in confusion for a moment.  I recheck the menu, recheck the label: yup, no way I would have known (not even any prices on the alcohol).  Obviously a scam to try and get people to overbuy.  So i send it back.  \""would you like anything else instead?  we have it on draft too.\""  no thanks; you'll probably give it to me in a two-gallon boot and then charge me $25 for it.  So i got my food and got the hell out of here."
1,"Best pizza on the planet!  Wouldn't hesitate recommending this place.\n\nWe went for dinner even though we had heard there would be a LONG wait.  Only waited about 20 minutes but was worth the wait.  Best pizza, great service.\n\nWent back for lunch the next day and the manager greeted us by name.  Makes one feel valued;-)"
1,This is a real burger for ordinary people.  You have to love the fact that they dont start cooking it until you purchase it.  Its fresh and so are the toppings.  It may be a small place but it seems to keep busy so I will be back.  So much good food in Montreal and this is one of the places to stop when you are walking and visiting the city.  J'adore mon Montreal.  C'est Bon
1,"Best quesadilla I've ever had! Me and some coworkers ate here for lunch today; it was most of our first times here. This food is definitely Americanized... But it doesn't mean that it isn't good. \n\nThey give out baskets of chips to nibble on. They weren't very warm like I expected them to be but they were very good\n\nThe menu is not as broad as most Cantinas but there were some good choices. I got the Arizona quesadilla half which was extremely filling. Other coworkers got a tamale plate, fajitas, and a veggie quesadilla. No complaints from our table. \n\nService was good and prices were reasonable. Will definitely be returning."
0,"Too, too crowded! Drinks are ridiculously overpriced and not strong nor particularly large. Hated the inside part of the club so we spent the majority of the evening outdoors. Nicki Minaj was supposed to be there the night we were there but she never showed. Thank goodness we didn't pay to get in! Hooray for being a girl in Vegas. No it's not fair but neither is life."
0,"My family and I are looking for an excellent Vietnamese place last Dec 19th for my son's birthday since he has been craving for Pho.  I picked this place due to the good reviews.  Boy, was I wrong!  The entire family was disappointed with the food.  They are definitely cheap -- you do get what you paid for.  Place is old, greasy floors and looks very small.  \n\nMy husband and I order the bbq pork combo and the well done pho with tendons.  The meat on the pho was extremely dry and there were barely any tendons.  The soup base was ok.  The bbq pork was dry as well, the egg thingy that came with the combo was bland and the eggroll was too oily and bland as well.  The guy also came out to tell us that they ran out of rice -- we were shocked!  OMG! This is an Asian restaurant and rice is part of their meals, why would they ran out of rice at 7pm??  The other people that came after us had rice on their plates except for us.  They also got their food first before we got ours!!!  We also got the shrimp rolls which were dry as well and the peanut sauce was bland.\n\nMy family are definitely not coming back here for sure!!  Very disappointed considering it has good reviews from other yelpers.  I guess some people opts for quantity rather than quality.  Such a horrible experience!!!"
0,"The only reason we came here is because we were watching a concert and wanted a resto close by. I would suggest skip the food and stick with the beer. The beer selection is really good but can't say the same for their food. Some of the items that were decent: frisee salad with mushrooms, duck rillettes, mac & cheese. Don't order their sliders, super dry, tasteless and nasty. If Chef Ramsay saw the sliders I got, he would toss it across the kitchen. Their service is pretty good, the server was super friendly. Overall, don't come here unless you want to drink a few beers before a concert."
1,"Yay!  Karaoke during happy hour was worthwhile;  I would not pay full price.    They had my fav white wine (Kim Crawford Sauv. Blanc) so Kudos for that.  Great Song Selection, okay crowd, people were not extremely friendly there."
1,We had to get trammed to our baggage claim and such but I've done that in ChiTown airport before and it's not a biggie. The tram is clean. So all good. \n\nThey have cute clay sculptures! and yes I took photos with them! SO CUTE! I love it!\n\nThe place kinda smells of smoke even tho they said NO smoking. :P\n\nThey already have slots in there hahaha... oh Vegas. :P\n\nVery colorful and lots of lights. Very Vegas.\n\nGetting a cab is easy. They have a great system to wait in line and stations to go in so no one fights.\n\nSweet.
1,"Perfect breakfast, brunch, or lunch. I had the monte cristo which was just the right amount of sweet and a great blend of flavors. My husband had the chicken and the egg and it too was delicious. Both the chips and cucumber salad are solid sides. We will be back. Highly recommend."
1,"Penn Ave Seafood Co's second location in downtown Pittsburgh.  They are open for lunch and dinner (serving dinner WED - FRI starting November 10).  The menu seems to be virtually the same as the original location in the strip.\n\nYou can see the menu at their website, but basically it consists of all sorts of different sushi rolls and platters.  They also have 10 or so $9-12 sandwiches and 6-8 other items (Tacos, pizza) that vary with the season from what I can tell.\n\nHonestly, the food is extremely tasty.  The sandwiches are always cooked to order and the sauces and aiolis are always quite tasty.  The cole slaw and salads that come on the side are also well conceived (I had a couscous apple chickpea salad with mine).  The ciabatta breads are very tasty but soft enough to be manageable in a sandwich form.\n\nThe only critique I have at the moment is that the layout is rather awkward.  It is sometimes hard to tell if they are even open walking by, and it is hard to see the menu board while waiting in line.\n\nI hope to return soon and split a sushi platter with friends.\n\nBYOB"
1,We are currently staying at the Four Seasons Troon North and for some reason have never eaten at their signature restaurant Talavera...........\nWe went there a few nights ago to celebrate our daughters college acceptance to UC Davis and they pulled out all the stops!  They printed a congratulations note on the menu which made this very special for our daughter.  The service and food was fantastic!!  At the end of our meal they prepared a special cake for our daughter and it was fabulous.....did not think I would ever taste a cake as good as our wedding cake but it was all that and more.\nThanks Four Seasons for making our daughters night one she will never forget!!!
0,As a grocery store....it's ok. What really surprised me is when I went to their meat department looking for knockwurst. The guy in the meat department didn't even know what that was and referred me to Harris Teeter. WTF?????
0,"Oh man where do I begin about his place. First off I received a coupon by mail and noticed how appealing the picture of the breakfast food looks on this coupon so it got my attention. That weekend I decided to go check it out. Pulling up the building looks old and when we went inside it was no different. The decor/people who ate and work there looks like something you would find along a middle of no where truck stop. When I entered the place it had a old musky smell. I tried to not let that bother me because I was there really wanting to try the appealing food that was shown on the coupon. The waitress right away sat us at our table, asked us for our drink order but literally took for ever for that women to give us our drinks and really couldn't understand why since there was hardly anyone there and there was a few ladies working. When we finally ordered and got our food I was really disappointed. The picture and the food they served us did not look alike. So I tried to enjoy it but the food had a funny taste to it so I ate half of my plate. I was still hungry so I ate my daughters leftover pancakes she didn't eat. That was good. I mean how wrong can you go with making pancakes. I was taking a bite and I noticed a hair cooked in the pancake from that point I got up and paid for my meal. I was so disgusted from that place I had to leave quickly. After we left I was so grossed out I had to wash my hand because my hands smelled like that place and I would gross out. I will never eat there again and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
1,"Went here Saturday night, a party of 12, for our work \""holiday gathering\"". First time I had ever been, and kind of ashamed to say first time I even noticed this place. Must have driven by  it a couple dozen times, shopping at Traders Joes, and never once noticed it there. \nNeedless to say, I regret not knowing about this place until now. They seemed comfortable handling such a large party, and judging by the party rooms in the back of the restaurant they have plenty of practice! I can't for the life of me remember our servers names (2 gentlemen) but they handled everything great. Each server basically had one side of a very long table. \nGreat explanations and suggestions from the servers. They were extremely knowledgeable about all the food, and promptly answered any questions we had about the menu. Even getting down to details about how the food is prepped and cooked. That I really loved. \nThe apps were great we had the calamari, and crab dip. We ordered 2 of each and they were gone within minutes.\nEveryone seemed to really enjoy their food, out of 12, 1 dish was sent back for being under cooked. I loved my food as did my wife, I had the halibut, which according to our server is one of the most popular on the menu. The halibut was cooked perfectly, served on one of the most delicious crab/potato cakes I have ever had. Wife had the lamb, came cooked perfectly. and was delicious. \nOne drink was forgotten, but was comped at the end.\nOverall, everyone left very happy, all of the staff was great, would love to come back and try it without a huge group!"
0,"I really wanted to like this place, I really did. \nMy husband and I sat at the bar, and after about a minute my husband had to point out to the bartender that the table needed to be wiped down. Were given menus. We stared at the beer menu on the board, and we probably looked like idiots, but no one ever came over and asked us anything. We finally waved a waiter down. Asked for some suggestions, all i heard was mumbling, didn't want to help, gave us a sheet and told us to put the numbers down of the beers we wanted to try. Gave us our flights, never came over to ask us if we liked anything in particular or if we had any questions... nothing. We also ordered the Porky pizza. The concept is great but there was waaaaaaaayyyyyy to much sage on the pizza, totally overpowering. I had to dig in and take the huge pieces off so I can eat the pizza. We paid, got up, not a thank you for coming, nothing. Don't care. \nThats fine I don't care either and I won't come back. \nGo to Four Peaks Brewing in Tempe. Great crowd, great beers, great atmosphere, great bartenders!!!!!!!! Or Brat Haus in Scottsdale!! Great food and servers are very knowledgeable and actually CARE if you like the beer or not!!"
0,"Wow! So so disappointed,  first thing the woman said was table no kids allowed at the bar . What service I get it no small children my daughter is 12 not really a tiny kid and she loves sushi! I believe it's my choice where I sit I am a paying customer . What a joke . Oh yeh and the grade from the  health department wasn't even up. that isn't a good thing people. KAIZEN is the best in town anyway."
1,"This is the only Chinese place I order from. They are very good with delivery, always on time, and always have the exact thing I order. This place should have more stars, they don't have five star food by any means, but you get the good value you pay for. Best Chinese delivery in the area. Ordered from \""Yang House\"" twice, and was very disappointed they never delivered what I ordered, so I looked else where and found this nice little gem.\n\nBY THE WAY, this place is real NY style Chinese; if you order chow mein (like our friend Nicole H. here) you will get no noodles. If noodles are included in the dish you want, read the menu, and order lo mein."
1,"I had never heard of pranic healing before and I'm more than just a little bit skeptical, but I kept an open mind. I went to Ling, originally because I had pain in my shoulders. Immediately , I felt relief, but beyond that, I felt a very rich spiritual connection.  Ling is very sensitive and passionate about helping people. I strongly recommend that every one go to Direct mindpower with a open heart and mind. It will change you!"
0,"I'm going to reiterate what other reviewers have said previously. The service is completely lacking here. The servers - while friendly - take an exorbitant amount of time to come to your table. The kitchen - while making incredibly tasty food - is unacceptably slow. And the price you pay for both is just far too much for what you get. \n\nAs for kid/family friendly, I would try somewhere else or get carry out. This place is a brewpub that tries to be good for families, but in the end it's still just a bar.\n\nTasty food but not enough to make up for the other detractors."
0,"I wasn't expecting downtown Phoenix Mexican food, but was looking forward to a good burrito. Highly disappointing. \nTortillas were cold/crunchy, burritos were mainly tortilla. Maybe it was grocery day for Mi Familia. I'm almost sure the taco shells are made before hand and then sit until someone orders a taco. \n\""Salsa bar\"" was pretty cute. Salsa was watery and bland, too much pepper & not a lot of substance. \nIf your going to offer chips & salsa, deliver. We got a small 3 inch in diameter Styrofoam bowl of maybe 12 chips. \n\nDel Taco does better."
0,"Food is tasty; however, food establishment REFUSED to honor purchased coupon from Living Social.  DO NOT spend your hard-earned money at India Palace."
0,"What the heck.  \nAs we waited 45 minutes for our car to be washed we noticed a lot of complaints going on. Looks like something may have been stolen out of a couple of cars not exactly sure. We had just come back from Costco bought two things one of them was a gallon of pure maple syrup.  Not a big deal until it goes missing! Who wants maple syrup really! My husband called in the morning to see if maybe it had been in lost and found manager says will look into it call him back.  two days later no call back. Doesn't matter if it's maple syrup, Or something expensive the fact that you can't take your car to get cleaned without having to worry if they're going to steal something is very scary\nOutside as the cars were being cleaned it sounded like there was a competition going on as to how many cars they can get done in an hour.   What a bunch of chaos will not go back!"
0,"6 of us went to Binks Midtown on friday night for a friend's birthday dinner. I would give the ambiance and food a 4 or 5 but the service was quite poor. My friend touched the bread serving dish and burned her hand so badly her fingers blistered. There was No warning about the temperature of the serving plate and there were  no apologies for her sizzling fingers either. She asked for ice to stop the pain and had to repeat the request 4 more times to 3 different people to get a simple ice-cube - which finally appeared about 15 minutes after she was burned.  \nThey knew ahead of time that it was a birthday for one of our group and there was not even a cupcake or a happy birthday wish from our server.\nAppetizers were brought out one at a time and out of sequence so  some of us were nearly done while others had yet to receive their starters.\nThe server seemed unaware of the use of \""please\"" or \""thank-you\""\nEvery request had to be made 3 or 4 times - everything was so slow it spoiled the experience. \nAs I said, the food was special but the service was so poor, I will not recommend it nor will I return."
1,"A Caf\u00e9... at the Encore... bound to lead to some confusion...\n\nFinally out and about around 1:30 am after a serious alcohol coma, we were hungry and looking for a place to eat.  This being the nearest one since we were staying at the hotel and still open at this time seemed like the best option.  Still, 'caf\u00e9' doesn't inspire much confidence; yet to our surprise, we were delightfully mistaken!\n\nVery chic and sexy, great service and AWESOME food.  Sure, a bit pricey but let's remember where we are.  My boyfriend and I shared the Ultimate Steak & Eggs Sliders and a mixed greens salad.  Wow! The sliders really blew me away!!!  I know - sliders! The Bacon-Cheddar Muffin was to die for, the filet mignon was oh-so-tender and tasty and the egg and creamed spinach were the perfect finishing touch.  The fries were tasty as well and my boyfriend definitely loved the mini ketchup bottle.\n\nThis was all so good we returned twice during our stay for breakfast.  I love it that they have a good selection of Bloody Marys and that the girl actually mixes them tableside and customizes them for you! The Society with blue cheese stuffed olives is a must!  Their Frosted Flake French Toast was excellent and the Chocolate cream definitely serves to balance out the sweetness of the bananas.  Their two eggs 'free style' with the country ham are the best choice! The home fries are good as well.\n\nAll in all, very impressed! A must try at any hour!"
1,"A. Even if you are not staying at the Mandarin Oriental, visit MOZen, it is excellent. \n\nB. The service was phenomenal.  Our waiters, Steve (a great resource for all that is Vegas and a man who knows his sake) and Alex (new to the game but eager to help) did a great job taking care of us.\n\nC. Go with the Bento Box, you will not be disappointed.  It is a filling variety of what MO has to offer and keeps things light if you are about to hit the town.\n\nD.  Their sake list was out of this world and reasonable.  Cheaper than what we pay for at high end places in Texas.  \n\nE. Excellent, fresh sashimi.\n\nIf you have the time, perhaps to just check out the MO or spend an evening around City Center, go and enjoy an intimate dinner at MOZen.  It is well worth it."
0,"The dueling pianos were good... the video screens to watch the people dancing in front of the pianos were better... but the bartenders were the worst we had on the trip. Or, the worst I've had anywhere in recent memory. Why a bartender would ignore customers when they're not busy doing anything else is kind of a mystery to me. While there's plenty of rudeness to go around at bars, I wouldn't expect it to be sourced from the people serving drinks.\n\nAlso, they have a very strict ID policy here, and the door guy looked at mine about as long as the TSA guy at the airport did. And yes, the law is the law, but this was the first time I'd been ID'ed in sin city. Strange enough it was worth noting."
0,"I know being a local its practically a sin to say I don't like Capriottis but thats how I feel especially after eating here about a million times.\n\nThese are the reasons why: too much bread for the sandwiches, gross selection of chips, expensive for a sub, cheap deli meats and only pre-shredded iceberg lettuce available no mixed greens or spinach. Also the stuffing for the turkey sandwich, with cranberry sauce, is either bland or alternates with being really salty and dry/crumbly."
1,"This is the kind of sprawling vinyl store I love frequenting. Boxes piled everywhere, you could never get through the whole thing in one visit.  The idea is to come for an hour and pick through whatever is on your mind, hoping to unearth a treasure or two.\n\nI was tempted over and over again here as I browsed through their selection.  Both new and used records seemed reasonably priced.  They also have supplies and such, so its a full service stop.  Employees were friendly and seemed knowledgeable. \n\nIf you want to start building your vinyl collection, careful frequent visits to Revolver's is a great start. And of course for those looking to round out what you already have, you'll pry find something here as well.  I certainly did."
1,My first experience at Ivy Laser was very comfortable. I love how comfortable the owner made me feel :) The laser machine she uses is not even close to painful as my past experience. Love it!
0,"Came here for lunch.  I ordered the ceviche and what I received was basically chips and watery salsa with a few chunks of shrimp.  I may sound like a snob, but I've enjoyed authentic ceviche in Peru and this sorry excuse for seafood salsa is not what ceviche is supposed to be.  Ceviche is raw fish \""cooked\"" in lemon/lime juice with peppers and onions."
0,"I am completely disgusted with how i was treated at this business. I have been here a couple of times to get go-go gear for music festivals, and i was treated fine. This time around, i came in around 8:00 PM on a Wenesday only because on their website (www.vavoomlasvegas.com) and on their yelp page it said that they are open Wednesday-Friday 12-10. \nWhen i arrived at the boutique, the doors were locked but there were about 10 girls shopping casually, chatting with the workers and what not. I knock on the door, and a fairly older man with black longer hair cracks open the door only to say \""can i help you?\"" Umm yeah, can i come in and shop please? He continues to tell me that the store is closed. I state to him that thats not what they are advertising, that the website says they are open until 10pm on wednesdays. He rudely tells me to my face that im wrong and that they are closed.\nI let him know again that on their website they are posting different hours of operation and that i had driven about 20 minutes to come to this specific boutique. As i am saying that he cuts me off and loudly says \""do you even know what you want? Oh wait i know what you want, you want to shop, so why dont you just come back tomorrow when we open at noon and you can have more time to shop then?\""\nAt that point I am horrified with this persons idea of customer service, and i tell him not to worry, and i wont be back. He then just says okay bye and slams the door shut in my face.\n\nMind you, the entire time this was going on, i could smell smoke coming out of the store. I will never be back, and i will tell everyone i know to never go to this establishment and to warn everyone they know as well. I have never been treated so horribly at a business."
0,"I really wanted to like this place.  We were driving through Dormont, saw all of the neon lights and turned around to check it out.  There was a \""Victory\"" sign, which is a sign of excellent Pennsylvania beer, and after living in Southern California for eight years, I became quite the Mexican food junkie.  About a mile up the road is the place where I got my first sampling of Mexican Food in the 70s, Jose and Tony's, which has lost its luster under the new ownership, so Mexi-Casa sounded like our new hope in my old stomping ground.\n\nWell, they did have good beer on tap - ONE good beer.  Victory Hop Devil is an old favorite, and I buy it often.  There was something not quite right about the 22-ounce Hop Devil that I was served. (Besides the whopping $7.25 purchase price...)  It didn't taste right, and I know what it's supposed to taste like.\n\nThe menu got my hopes up.  It was quite extensive, and I quickly decided on the \""Soon-To-Be-Famous\"" steak burrito, because nobody can resist advertising like that.  My partner got a trio of tacos - grilled chicken, taco meat, and steak.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our food to be prepared, we munched a basket of tortilla chips and salsa, which I immediately identified as being produced by Reyna Foods in the Strip District.  Yay!  Reyna makes the best chips and salsa in the city.  SCORE!  We loved the chips and salsa and didn't mind paying $5.50.  My partner's margarita was pretty good, but the bartender looked at us with a blank stare on her face when I asked if she could get us a BLUE margarita, my favorite drink up the street at Jose and Tony's.  Nope.\n\nWhen the food arrived, I admired the presentation, but was quickly disappointed, because despite the fact that my burrito was quite a handful, it was absolutely the most bland tasting burrito I had ever had.  All I could taste was virtually unseasoned rice and a very large amount of refried beans.  The steak inside had zero flavor, and I had to pile on large amounts of the Reyna salsa to get any flavor at all.  Unseasoned meat piled up with rice and beans in a large flour tortilla does NOT a burrito make...\n\nMy partner's tacos were three different meats, but were virtually indistinguishable.  The ingredients had virtually no seasoning whatsoever.  In fact, we shared quite a snicker when we looked inside the \""steak\"" taco, which was highlighted by little strips of sliced up \""Steak-Ums,\"" totally unseasoned, overcooked, cardboard pieces of \""meat.\""\n\nWell, the people working there were very nice, and they had a pretty good crowd when we walked in.  I decided that I will give this place another chance and try something else on the menu next time, but it is my sincere hope that in the meantime, someone will bring the blandness factor to the owner's attention.  Even if my bill had been half of what it was, I would have walked out thoroughly dissatisfied, because the place is actually pretty nice, and the servers are very nice, and it's in one of my favorite parts of town.  It really deserves one-and-a-half stars for tonight, anyway...\n\nI would have given this dining experience a SINGLE star had it not been for the fact that the people working there were so friendly."
0,I would like to rate zero stars but there was no zero option. We spent well over $50.00 dollars for a single pizza and order of wings that was easily the most horrible dining experience of my life. The pizza was so grotesque that nobody even attempted to eat it. The oil/lard had congealed to a solid state and smelled absolutely disgusting.\n\nThe wings were so raw they were rubbery to the touch and nobody attempted to eat those either. We asked for the wings to be well done as this the only way we have ever eaten wings. Suffice to say I will never ever eat this crap hole again and suggest you dont either if you value your health. I spoke to someone who claimed to be the owner and was not offered my money back on completely uneaten and satisfactory food. Needless to say I will be calling the department of health as soon as they open.
0,"Hmm... I'm not sure what I was expecting from my first taste of Native American food but, my Navajo Taco from The Fry Bread House was did not live up to any ideas I had.  The fry bread is good enough... of course, anything you deep fry is usually tasty but, the taco was super bland and nothing interesting.  It basically was fried bread with lettuce, beans and some cheese slapped in it.  :-/\n\nWhen I add the lackluster food to the fact that the man at the counter was not friendly at all... rude actually, I don't have a very satisfied feeling about my experience.  My friend was trying to order the stew and some fry bread and the man treated him like he was dumb for not knowing that you have to order a combo to get both.  Then, when we ask what drinks they had, the man kinda rolled his eyes and pointed to a sign... again, like we should have already know where the sign was or what their options were.  Really?  We walked in and right up to the counter so we didn't have much chance to familiarize ourselves with their exact set-up.  I almost said something but, didn't want any chance of retaliation in our food. \n\nSo, my friends stew was full of flavor and my taco had none.  The only saving factor was the dessert fry bread at the end... \n\nI'd go back to try other things if friends invited me again but, I might try to find a different fry bread location since the big guy behind the counter was so rude and condescending at this one.  \n\nProlly won't see ya there."
1,"This place is amazing! I have only ever come here for breakfast but on that basis alone I give it 5 stars. Their Irish Boxty is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had in my life and the atmosphere is great. Oh and the Bloody Marys are delicious! When you step into Piper's Pub off Carson Street it feels to me like you've stepped into an actual Irish pub. Everyone is there to eat great food, have a good brew, and to watch the soccer games. A lot of the patrons are appropriately dressed in their favorite soccer team attire and it can get pretty rowdy when a good game is going which I think only adds to the greatness of this place. The staff are friendly, helpful, and really seem to enjoy their jobs. I can't wait to visit for lunch or dinner someday soon. I highly recommend Piper's Pub....definitely one of the best spots in the 'burgh!"
0,"Never have I wanted to punch a sales guy in the face more than when we visited Rite Carpets. In fact, he told me he was the owner. I find that hard to believe because this guy was so rude, there's no way he has kept this place in business for this many years. Not only did he tell us that we were wrong with every bit of information we gave about our project, but also told us that we trying to confuse him because we were \""rattling off too many numbers and measurements\"". If you can't keep up buddy, get a job where you don't deal with people and measurements! We will never do business here again and will make sure everyone of our colleagues knows that this place is a joke."
1,"Being a snotty coffee loving snot snot I wasn't expecting much from Dunkin\"" Donuts.  But, they just got done with their facelift and grand re-opening here is Arizona, and its close to work, so I wanted to give them a try.  I have to say I see why they are Starbuck's #1 competition on the east coast.  The store was clean and well organized.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  I ordered the flatbread gilled cheese combo for lunch which comes with iced tea or lemonade.  I got the iced tea, and it was delicious.  My grilled flatbread had three cheeses, and was fast, and warm, and very tasty.  This is not what I was expecting, and they have a great operation running here.  I WILL be back!  Oh, and my donut with pink strawberry frosting was delicious as well!"
1,Best food in town. By a mile.
0,"Food's decent enough for a restaurant that mainly serves students. Because of such, their selection is limited to the most common Korean dishes like pork bone soup or bibimbap - the quality of which is just tolerable. They offer lunch discounts from 12-3 on some of their most popular dishes.\n\nFor the most part I'd stick to the pork bone soup, tonkatsu and bulgogi. Their other dishes were very bland. If you want Korean food close to campus (uWaterloo), this is probably the best you're gonna get. (I do however really like their sweet potatoes :3)"
0,"Okay so first time here now the food is great well not all of it the hand dipped ice cream is more hand dipped milkshake the chicken is not fully cooked the customer service is horrible the guy who rings people up has an attitude to everyone who walks in the buffet he lacks hospitality, the waitresses dont smile or acknowldege you when you arrive to your table since you sit yourselfves no1 said hi to me at all not even welcome to golden corral so for the first vegas and neveda location its 1 star they make money $$$$$ but they dont make that happy memorable service."
1,"This place was a huge surprise and a huge relief!\n\nBeing a foodie, and quite the fan of healthy food, this place definitely lives up to those expectations.  If you've ever been to San Francisco, then you'll definitely get that feel when you enter the cafe.\n\nIt's got a great atmosphere, and the menu is by far the best when it comes to serving healthy \""organic\"" foods.  I know that many places in the valley claim to serve healthy food, but serving \""all-natural\"" and locally farmed foods doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy.  People that are true foodie's know exactly what I mean.\n\nI ordered the Dragon Bowl with quinoa and it was delicious.  I'm excited to try this place again."
1,"First time staying at a hotel off of the strip. It did not disappoint! It's right across the street from the Fremont Street Experience. Waiting in the check in line took quite long but it was understandable considering it was a busy weekend. \n\nStayed in a a room with a double bed and I have to admit, it was quite spacious for what we paid, which was a deal itself for three nights. The staff was very friendly every time we needed something and prompt too. I would definitely stay here again.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like was that the bath tub had shower curtains instead of doors. The bathroom was also very small."
0,"You may need to find a new nail tech b/c this review unfortunately will bring your rating down.. I am shocked on the poor customer service of this salon as it is impossible to get ahold of anyone, (NO answering service/no calls back) and after days of trying I got one text to ask when I would like to schedule an appt to get mani/pedi. I responded right away and then got no response after that.. Not sure how you expect to stay in business with this type of service. I have canceled my groupons due to this unfortunately. Too bad.."
0,"I'm afraid this is one of those \""I wanted to love it, but...\"" reviews. \n\nWe had an assortment of tacos and burritos.  They were fine but absolutely nothing special whatsoever.  Yes, they were authentic Mexican tacos (i.e., not Taco Bell) but is that really supposed to be something special in Arizona for cryin' out loud?   It's not like we're in Canada here, people.\n\nI saw the piece on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives where they made a big deal about their variety of salsas and how people came from miles around to buy them.\n\nSeriously?  They had exactly two salsas.  Again, they were fine, but nothing special and nothing at all like what we saw on TV.  We ordered chips and salsa and got a small little french fry tray of chips with no salsa.  I asked the girl at the counter for salsa and she pointed to the same two bottles. Ah, ok.  Woo hoo.\n\nI would happily stop there if I was in the neighborhood but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."
1,"I dig how small this place is. I felt super comfortable sitting on the floor and digging through the bargain bins. Everything is priced well. They had a decent selection for being a small shop, and when I asked about a specific artist, they recommended I follow them on Facebook, where they would absolutely list any of his albums they got it. I'll certainly be back on a regular basis."
1,Every time we com to CP Forum Shops we always pop in to MARC BY MARC JACOBS and every time we get excellent service.  The sales staff is very helpful and go above and beyond!
0,"Yellow cab in Pittsburgh is a total joke. They're never on time. Good luck getting one after 12 AM. They don't show up, when they do they act like they don't know how to process a credit card, they're shady, and they're just downright unprofessional. This city needs a public transportation overhaul. The fact that you can't get a cab after having a night out with your friends is absolutely ridiculous."
0,My girlfriend took my mini Australian Shepard here today as this is where her doggie goes. I'm not sure what was going through their mind when they shaved her all the way down. Seems to like there were lazy and didn't want to take the time to give her a proper groom. Hair was unevenly cut. She's a long haired mini Australian Shepard. Nobody wants this dog to look like a rat. You will never have my business again. Elite grooming on rainbow will continue to get my business as usual.
0,"I don't know why they're always so busy, the food was horrible! They make you pay on the way in and then you're stuck! Do not recommend!"
1,"Drive thru gets clogged quickly with caffeine addicts.\nThis being said the staff is on it like a rabbit in a hole.  They're fast, quick moving little bunnies aiming to please the heck out of those desperate caffeine addicts.\nThey keep the inside of this place clean if you ever get out of your car.\nIt's got the new updated look so it looks a bit too hip for Fitchburg.\nLast time I waited in line, they gave me a free coupon since it took so long.\nNo sweat Starbucky Bunnies, I'll be back."
1,So... although I was celebrating my 25th in Vegas.... and it was my first time- I have to say that I had a great time and I didn't stay on the strip. The staff is great and we were greeted with a smile and 2 warm cookies! There is a shuttle that runs to the MGM every hour- so that was quite helpful! Saved me and the BF about $60 in taxi fares. It'll run about $20 from the strip back to the D.T. They have an applebee's on site- pretty cool... especially when you don't want to pay to go anywhere... Although they did have a cafe in the lobby.... I didn't get a chance to check it out. Anywho- they have a nice workout room and small pool.... for the price and convienence- not bad at all!
1,"The Vermont Sandwich Co. offers a varied and unique menu. I got the \""dead ahead\"" wrap, which had chicken salad, cranberry sauce, and thin slices of Granny Smith apples. It was a fresh blend of sweet and savory flavors and the veg was nice and crisp and not soggy at all (a problem that usually occurs with wraps). I also got the potato salad which was perfect! It actually tasted like potatoes rather than mayonnaise soup. The place is small, so I would recommend take out rather than staying for lunch. Definitely recommend!"
0,"Came way out to this part of town for an event, otherwise we probably never would have made our way here. \n\nI would have given them a much higher rating, but several aspects of the meal combined resulted in a mediocre and anger-inducing experience.\n\nThe first thing we noticed upon our arrival was the obnoxious birthday singing accompanied by horns, whistles and a loud speaker. Understandable, as most places do this kind of thing, but it happened at least 4 times during our time there. There was a guy running around doing shots with people and singing songs, blowing his whistle and joking around. \n\nOnce we were seated, we waited a while before Eric came and took our drink orders, explaining the different types of sake flavors to us and being overall boisterous. Fine, you're super-genki-man, we get it.  I can even be cool with that, but the problem arose when he explained the \""Mother's Day Special\"" to us and conned us all into getting it. Yes, conned. We were told that for our $80 meal we'd get an appetizer, 2 wine glasses of flavored sake, soup, salad, fried rice, veggies and a portion of teppanyanki-cooked lobster & filet mignon PLUS a $20 gift card. Which made it seem totally worth the price- after all, the meals themselves cost about $20-30 a piece normally and that'd be 2 for one! BUT, when we paid our bill, the gift card turned out to be good ONLY for the location we were at. If this restaurant was in our neighborhood, that'd be cool- but this location is out in the boondocks of north town and we're coming out from East-central. And not only that, but the gift card is only good for their sushi, which from the reviews I'm less than enthusiastic about traveling back the 20 miles to try. We felt totally misled by the deal. If we had known, we would have opted for another, cheaper meal option.\n\nThe food itself... the soup was good- I was expecting a miso soup but it turned out to be a flavorful clear soup with fried onions and button mushrooms. I liked it but the mushrooms seemed out of place. The salad itself was simple salad mix with a piece of cucumber and tomato topped with a miso vinegarette- tasty, but nothing particularly revolutionary. The appetizer we chose was shrimp tempura- 2 pieces of shrimp and 1 piece of sweet potato and 1 piece of zucchini. I'm guessing we got the shrimp and veggie, then? Crunchy with a yummy sauce, but kind of misleading and I wouldn't have been happy to pay the $8 for it. After that the chef came out, he had a great tableside manner and entertained our group. He and the super-attentive waitresses were what got the star for the place. He started by juggling some eggs and quick frying them. After that, the rice and the ubiquotus special sauce came out. TONS of fried rice, coated in a weird pink butter/shortening \""special sauce\""- I'm guessing something with MSG and other seasonings because it made me feel unpleasant after. The shrimp, lobster and steak were all coated in it, too, as others have said. The portions were much smaller- 3 shrimp, half a lobster tail and roughly 3-4 ounces of filet mignon per person. Two of our companions asked to have extra steak instead of the lobster but got the same portion as us without the lobster. The lobster itself was overcooked and one of our companions thought it tasted like eggs. \n\nWhen we got our bill, the sake we had ordered was actually 2 dollars more than what was listed on the menu. Not a huge amount- but in this economy it's worth noting. With the $80 meal, 1 small bottle of sake [9.50 instead of 7.50], 1 Orion beer [$8] & 1 Sapporo [$7.50] our bill came out to over $110. Which I wouldn't have minded paying if I hadn't felt misled about the card, the quality of the food was better, and we didn't have SUPER loud music being blasted every 15-20 minutes with super-genki-man running around with a bullhorn and whistle.. It felt like I was paying for the show and not the food, and the environment just wasn't enjoyable for my boyfriend and I. Maybe it's better during the week or lunch, but it was a lot of flash for hardly any quality."
0,"I have eaten at Uncle Sam's periodically since 1991. Today was my last time. We attempted to use a discount card that was purchased from a high school fundraiser. I handed the server the card when I ordered. Only after we were done eating she came over with the check and informed us that we couldn't use the card as the single Pepsi didn't count towards the \""food order.\"" I had the manager come over and all he did was to argue and tell me that he would get fired if he gave the small discount as it was the \""owner's orders.\"" I asked if they were willing to lose a customer over having the proper purchase amount but being just $2.00 short in the \""food cost.\"" He essentially told me that if that was how I felt he couldn't do anything about it \""owner's orders.\"" If they are so absurdly adamant the card should have been more legible as I couldn't read the fine print even with reading glasses, and the server should have informed me of the fact when I ordered not after the meal was consumed. Any business that is willing to lose a customer over a few cents doesn't deserve to be in business. (The soft drinks are a huge profit margin for them, so the inflexible policy is inane.)\n\nOn another note the sandwiches are quite good although I can easily make a better Philly Cheesesteak at home. The pizza and wings are merely average. If you want far better wings go, to Sardella's."
1,Everything I could want for $3.
0,"Ordered and told it would arrive in 45 minutes and after an hour and 20 minutes called and was told we busy that's the way it goes. Customer service sucks. Called a second time at one hour and 45 minutes and was told the driver will get it to you when he can. The final time was just over 2 hours with not even an attempt to make anything right. When the food did arrive it was warm, not hot and again after a call the girl answering only said \""well it's not my fault\"""

No passing the basket and shaming you into giving even when it's your last dollar. If you have felt outcast, unworthy, unaccepted, unloved..... Verve is an upbeat place where  you are not constantly told if you eat a burger on friday your going to Hell!!! Do you have tattoos? Do you feel that you only have a wholy tee and faded jeans. Thats just the type of garb that is the most prevelant with the inhouse Ververs. Give it an hour.... It just may be what you have been looking for .....Oh and there's COFFEE!!!"
0,"Wow!!! I came to Las Vegas to have a great time, eat good food and above. My mother and I went to the Old Homestead Steakhouse @ Caesars Palace LV because we heard rave about it and we were craving steak. We got in line to see if we could be seated. There were a lot of people standing around to be seated and the restaurant was packed. The women that were behind the podium did not say \"" We'll be right with you\"" or anything to us. They were just in their own bubble. We were standing there for about 10 minutes until a woman worker looked over my mothers head and asks the people behind us have you been helped. Mind you that we were right in front of the podium. The men behind us asked if we have been helped and we said \""no\"". The women whose name I did not get looks at my mom and says \""What is it\"". My mother and I were instantly confused, mad, and upset. We gave you the decency to wait for you to help us. This incident gave me an epiphany and I will NEVER go to this restaurant again!!  I give this restaurant no stars but yelp would not let me continue without putting a star. Does not deserve any stars!(Wipes hands clean)"

When the last time I was told it's going to take 5-10 business days to add someone's name to the account.  I don't know what's the customer services here.  They charge $5 for bill reprint.  I was like \""WHAT???\"" Try to stay away from this company.  I will just wait til my contract is up, i will cancel it.  TERRRRRIBLE customer care!"
1,"This Banana Republic was awesome. Gigantic selection, great sales everywhere, and a great staff. The woman that helped me took 3 loads out of my hands periodically and had a dressing room waiting with all of my clothes when I was done browsing.

0,"I get a mani/pedi maybeeee 4-6 times a year. I am pretty good at painting my own nails, so unless I'm feeling supremely lazy or in dire need of pampering, I do them myself.\n\nLast Friday evening I was in a rush to get my nails done before a dinner (so of the two aforementioned moods--I was being supremely lazy). Charlie's Nails is 2 blocks from where I live, so out of haste, I chose to go here. I will never go back.\n\nThe customer service here is appalling. They request cash tips, and when I mentioned I didn't have cash and asked if I could tip using my card, the nail tech kindly suggested that I walk across the parking lot in my pedicure flip-flops to the ATM at Wells Fargo to withdraw some cash for tip. I asked if she was being serious. She replied with, \""It would be easier for me if you tipped in cash.\""\n\nOH! Well then let me shuffle across the parking lot in the dark in these 1mm thick foam flip flops and get you some cash! I hate myself for tipping her, but I know what it is like to work for tips and I am just not that person who tries to teach service workers a lesson by leaving no tip.\n\nHowever I am that person who will write a bad Yelp review about it. So here it is. Also, as if it even needs to be mentioned--the manicure was total shit (air bubbles in the polish, a peeling top coat). But it was the service that did this place in for me."
1,"Really good.  Garret was our server, late nite b4 a movie this place really hit the spot.  Our server was on point.  Kitchen was solid.  This definitely is our new late nite spot.  Comfy chairs too!"
1,We stumbled upon Clarinda's Cafe on the way to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. It is a very cute teahouse on the Royal Mile. \n\nThis place is perfect for a quick lunch or afternoon tea. We had sandwiches with salad and chips on the side. They also had an assortment of fresh baked cakes and pastries.
1,"Stayed at encore, and decided to go clubbing here so i wont have to drive. There is a water fall outside the dance floor in the club! Never seen that before. That was nice. Nice decor. Besides that is was cool. Ok music. Mix of EDM and hip hop/maybe top 40's. Bartender was super nice took care of me every time i walked near the bar. Usual vegas drink prices. Must see at least once."

1,"Since moving more centralized, this has become my wife and I's favorite pizza for dine in and to go, as well as the Bell location.  They offer gluten free crust, willing to do no cheese and several sizes of pizza, so your party can get one or two pizza's for all or everyone can get their own preference.  I generally get the small size for myself, which leaves my with 30-40% of the pie for leftovers for breakfast or lunch.  Not bad to get 2 meals for $8-12. The Lil' size is usually enough for 1, if you will not be near a fridge in the near future.  My faves are the Spicy Italian and Canadian.  The services is always, friendly and the staff makes you feel at home!"

1,"My family was invited to stay at Aria several times and finally accepted the offer for free rooms.  I am so happy that they did!  It is beautiful and the room is so great.  From the moment you walk in, you realize it is going to be different.  \n\nThe casino is classy and modern.  It is perfect.  I feel right at home with the modern dark woods and stainless steel accents.  The security at the elevators was great.  The Jean Phillips Pattiserie next to the elevators means you never have to leave the hotel hungry or thirsty and allows you to grab a quick snack till midnight.  \n\nThe rooms are perfect.  The control 4 system is easy as pie.  If you can use a smart phone, you will be fine.  I am spoiled now, and will want a control 4 system at home now.  \n\nThere is a beautiful shower and our view was great.  We would live to get a condo here...maybe some day we will.  There seems to be time left to buy in.\n\nThe dealer that we had for the spin the wheel thing, Nic was so lovely.  He was very interesting to talk to and was very helpful with playing the game my first time.  It was relaxed and a newly married couple filtered through from Australia as well as a couple from Mexico City that won $800.  \n\nThe shopping at Aria is great and I would love to pick a few things up I am eyeing including a solar powered backpack and Dior slides.  Also on my wish list are some spa clothes. (That is were they hide the nice comfy Aria brand merch.).  \n\nThe mall is a fantasy.  It has little tornados in tubes of water and computerized ice sculptures, a 2 story Tiffany and Louis Vuitton.  The Xerasacaping around City Center is the best I've seen, even living in LA.  \n\nI am a fan of Aria and hope to come back soon.  I will try the shuttle to Bellagio tonight from Crystals tonight to see the gardens there and then go up the Eiffel tower to see the fountains.  Last night at Aria is going to be great!"

1,"Their $5.99 sign for their extra large pizza caught my eye so I decided to give it a try. Really good pizza! I've had their chicken fingers too, also good. For the price, their pizza is a steal.

1,"New York Flavor is right around the corner from my place and I love going here.  They have the best food and the nicest service.  As many of the reviews mention, you must try the basil marscapone burger on your first visit.  It's what they are known for and is a great treat!"

1,"With our favorite Pete's Thai restaurant taken over by new owners, we were thrilled to find a terrific replacement nearby. Two Thai Sisters might lack in homey decor but they hit all the high notes in the kitchen. We found their Laotian curry to be as authentic as the amok we had in Luang Prabang a couple of weeks ago. Better yet is their massaman curry with chicken, the stir- fried seafood and their excellent pad thai with vegetables. \n\nSpicing is based on 1-5 level of heat. Go for the gusto and add a notch to your decision. Four was spicy but not fiery.\n\nThe massaman curry sauce was rich, sweet and flavorful without overpowering the tender chicken. The stir-fried seafood was a full portion of fish pieces, shrimp, fishballs and squid - not at all greasy or oily. The pad thai was perfect - lots of noodles and lots of vegetables that still had a bit of crunch to them. Chopped peanuts for the topping were served separately.\n\nPortions were generous and came with steamed rice. We were two hungry adults and after our dinner, there was more than enough left for one large lunch tomorrow! \n\nI hope that the Two Thai Sisters are doing a great take-out business because the premises are very large and does not seem very crowded. Hopefully this will change as word gets out. Excellent food, freshly prepared and reasonable prices."
0,"I've eaten here once, for lunch, and it was decidedly meh.  \n\nWe were seated promptly, but it took far too long for the food to come out.  \n\nI ordered a club sammich, which should be pretty much idiot proof to make.  There wasn't anything in particular wrong with it.  It just wasn't very good.  It was almost too huge to eat, and I could only get through half of it.  The accompanying fries were so so.\n\nThe rub is the sammich was nearly $15.00.  OK, it's Vegas, and lots of things are overpriced, but Planet Hollywood is no Cosmo, Bellagio, Wynn, Encore, etc."

However, my experience, not so good.\n\nI tried the place for a few free classes, and got the lavish love and swooning everyone looked for. That was totally dropped the instant I signed the contract. I barely got a nod as I came in from that point on. Boe was primarily focused on his female fighter, and had little to do with anyone else. If I wanted to work out on my own, I have a heavy bag and can run on the streets; why pay someone else to get just that.\n\nLater, when my schedule was adjusted at work, I informed him via his assistant that I could not come during the regular boxing times, and what other times were available? They said that they closed at 1 and re-open later in the afternoon. I told them that I would be working at that time. That's the last I heard of them. I ran into Boe at a bout a few months later, and said he would work something out but never responded to my emails. Basically I was being cold-shouldered until my contract expired.\n\nI would have been okay with the contract, I got suckered into it, but he could at least have had the dignity to respond.\n\nThere are much better gyms out there for boxing with trainers that actually want to train you. Skip Boe's. Besides, it's next to a 7-11 and a bar, which plays havok with your willpower."
0,"First time eating here and was unimpressed by the terrible service.I walked in, saw it was an order and pay before you sit place, which is fine, but  I heard they had a bar, so I asked to sit there.The hostess was nice, and pointed me towards the bar.Thats when things went downhill.I was the only person at bar, as I was meeting someone.When I Sat down bartender was hiding in the corner texting, and didnt notice, acknowledge me or even say hi.I sat there a good 10 minutes bein g ignored.Then the So called manager (who is terrible at his job).walks to the bar, sees her hiding and texting, sees me sitting there with no drink, no menu, no nothing, and he says hi amd just walks away.Unbelieveable!!!! At that point I was getting ready to leave but figured I should at least say something, so manager came back and was just standing around bar area, ,at this point its been about 15 minutes of being ignored).I try and get bartenders attention but she doesnt notice, so finally \""manager\""sees I am trying to get a drink and tears her away from her texting.She was nice and apologetic, but an awful bartender, had to ask for water refills, never cleared plates, just kinda ditzy.We ordered a pizza and a salad.They were both very good , especially the pizza crust and cheese.But this restaraunt is run by a bun ch of giggly 19 yr old girls who create a high school atmosphere.Also the older male manager is clueless and seems to let these kids goof off I nstead of work.While we were waiting for our pizza, I saw it sitting in the window and 2 employees walked right past it, and proceeded to go chit chat in the corner instead pf running the pizza.Clueless manager ended up running it after it was in the window for 5 minutes.Also there was a waitress there standing in the dining room giving dirty looks to one of her tables and loudly complaining.weird.This place has so much potential, but its run by bad management and apathetic high school girls.Also, if they got rid of the whole order, pay, sit thing it would work much better.Its a shame because the food is good, but ill never go here again after the horrific service."
1,The Henry has delicous food and great service. Stopped in for a quick bite and left extremely satisfied.  Can't beat the location and ambiance of The Henry.
1,"Great service, even let me borrow a phone charger when my phone was about to die. Came often to check on coals. Good amount of flavors, clean and hookahs were great. Only could be better if they served alcohol, but that's hard to find in hookah lounges out here!"
0,"This place is terrible, i love the concept its a fun place to visit but they couldn't make the food taste good,  after all those calories. The burgers tasted so plan it was not juicy at all, i mean come on i was hoping it tasted much better than that after the advertised fat content seriously wtf, maybe i had a bad order. The the shake was disgusting it had way to much unwanted flavor after a few scoops u get tired of it , i think they could make like 20 regular shakes from that one shake. And the fries it was the most disgusting fires i ever eaten, i thought it would taste good because it was fried with lard but it don't taste good at all and smells bad . Tell me what is the point of eating so much calories if the food don't taste good why do they have to put these unwanted calorie load when the food don't even taste good. Just make the food taste good not the calorie content higher that's all they gotta do. But still i do recommend visiting this place because of the theme of the whole restaurant."
1,"By far the best buffet I have ever been to!\n\nI'm not kidding or sugar-coating.  It was so good.  I recommend their meatloaf.  The sauce on it was amazing.  The whole buffet really is amazing.  I also recommend the ceviche and the desserts are to die for.\n\nThere is generally a bit of a line, like most buffets, but it moves fast.  Its a little expensive, I think like 40 bucks a person, but for what you get it is well worth it.  I make a point to take my family here every time they are in town.\n\nThe decor is beautiful, as is all the decor in the Wynn."
1,"What a girl wants, a girl gets! That's sweets, you know it. Would you believe a diamond-studded 125-carat Couture Pop can be had from this sweet spanking-new hot spot in Vegas? Yes, it is a one-of-a-kind delectable piece of sweetness. That premiered at the Grand Opening. \nThe Grand Opening attended by celebrities on the 4th of March was sure not missed!\n\nThe Couture Pop have many flavors to choose from. The pop is wrapped in a pop-out plastic cover. The bling-ed handle screws right off the sweet flavored pop to be replaced by any other flavor pop or when it's all gone. A complete ensemble of the Couture Pop comes in a box filled with different flavors and colored \""bling\"" beads at $25, or just the flavored pops without the bling-ed handles at $12.95. It's not just pops but many other items and souvenirs are ready to be had from this sweet factory. \n\nNot only that. Name another sweet item, like chocolates? Yes!! Crepes Yes!! Anything else to satisfy anyone's sweet craving. Just walk through the doors to the dining area called American Brasserie for more sweet cravings in an extensive menu which includes Black Angus steak, fries, omelets, chicken, waffles,and red velvet  buttermilk pancakes, signature sweet pizzas, fresh made savory and sweet crepes,chocolate fondues, and a favorite of mine is the frozen hot chocolate. Elegant atmosphere in classy modern decor. Waitstaff attentive.\n\nSugar Factory American Brasserie stay open 24 hours. To mention the best I had was the frozen hot chocolate and ahi tuna which was sweetimus that satisfied me with a blang! I say blang because the Couture Pop is likened to a bling enough and my hunger pang was satisfied max. Should I return? I'll be back."
1,"I usually don't write a review of an oft and well-reviewed restaurant, but felt compelled to key strokes for a few items on their fabulous menu that are missed in some of the reviews. Having been there a number of times since the first month they opened (I love the chef's Zinc Bistro too), I have alot of respect for a place that consistently delivers on food and ambiance. Does this place \""try too hard\""?  What the H does that mean? The waiters know the menu? Good. There is alot of wait staff? Good. They push drinks? No. \n\nIf you haven't tried the Peruvian clam stew, for first course or even for lunch, you are missing a truly refined dish. The clams and chorizo in the light golden liquid are heavenly. The tortas, especially the brisket, are really flavorful. I have no arguements with those who expound the virtues of their pork and beef dishes at dinner. Try weekend brunch or lunch too."

0,"Got the applewood bacon & cheddar egg sandwich on a plain bagel, but they forgot to heat it up... I noticed the cheese wasn't melted when they handed it to me, but when I sat down, I touched the bacon and it was cold like it was right out of the fridge! No way I was eating that, so I went back up to the counter to get a proper sandwich. They said they would warm it up. They did, and it was fine, but I don't understand why they didn't do it right the first time..."
1,"I initially came in to lay-away a TREK. They let me make my own terms that catered to my budget. They even tacked on a discount when submitting a payment on Black Friday. \nThey answered all my questions with reasonable knowledge and treated this prior military member with money problems with courteousness. \nIf you want a TREK, I haven't found one shop in the valley with their products."
1,"My husband and I were looking for something quick late on a Sunday - 9 PM - and didn't want to walk far from the movie theater.  As we were walking towards this place, some folks who had just eaten there asked if we were looking for a place to eat.  They had just eaten there for the first time and raved about it.  I had the chicken souvlaki pita and my husband the half chicken.  Both were delicious - the chicken was extremely moist and very flavorful.  The staff, too, was extremely friendly.  Would definitely go back!"
0,"This pho is not good.\n\nHaving not eaten the whole day due to interviews and such, I was starving for good, satisfying food. As my feet hurt from walking around so much and I was already staying in TI, I opted with a few friends to go to Pho, since it was in TI. \n\nI ordered the beef soup. It came out.. and it was very... meh. The broth was not the greatest.. there was barely any meat.. and just overall, the 12-13 dollar  bowl of Pho was not worth its money. I've had better for $4 in Philly.... but I was pretty disappointed. At the time, I didn't care, since I was so hungry, but looking back.. it wasn't so great.\n\nAnd on top of that, service was absolutely horrible. It took us 20 minutes to get in.. only to get seated and neglected. We had this older lady who seemed to forget about us. She finally took our order, 30 minutes later, being rude to one of my friends in the process of asking how we were going to pay our bill. My friend said, \""I would prefer credit..\"" and the waitress goes, \""cash? nope, no credit.\"" until we insisted we paid credit. Then, our food didn't come for another 30 minutes. My friends and I slowly dropped our tip with each passing minute... we were already getting down to 5% when our food finally arrived. We all commented... on how the beef was over cooked, etcera... and it was just not overall good. Sadness for such a nice decored restaurant.\n\nI should have spent an extra 10 dollars and just gone to the buffet at The Wynn. :P"
0,"I love buffets and am no food snob, but this buffet was the pits.  Everything lacked flavor.  Even the cocktail sauce for the cold shrimp was bland.  Went on crab leg night.  They were ok, but were served with melted margarine instead of butter.  It gets two stars instead of one because the staff were friendly and it was well stocked."
0,"Closed due to \""family emergency\"". I would have forgiven the fact that I drove a half hour to check you guys out but now I read in your reviews that other people say you are doing this on a regular basis? Not cool! I ended up going to KFC instead and had a horrible experience there. I just gave them a 1 star review too & they earned it but I'm not about to let you off the hook either because if you honored what you said I would have never been in that situation. I would've much rather eaten here (I think). I will update this if I decide to give your restaurant another shot. I wanted to try and see if Om was as good as people have been saying. However, I'm starting to feel like it's a sign to not waste my time since Om obviously doesn't care about our business if they're not honoring their posted hours. Who wants to drive all the way over and find out they are closed? Very unprofessional... especially for a fairly new restaurant trying to establish their clientele.\n\nMy advice to all... Call first before you make a special trip out."
1,"Alright, I'll admit it, I was one of those skeptics who thought there was no way a place called Poke Express in North Las Vegas could have a legitimate 5-star rating. I was wrong...\n\nPoke Express is a small deli-type store which serves... you guessed it... poke! For those of you who do not know, poke is small cuts of fish (mostly tuna) that are seasoned and served cold. The poke selection is not as big as those you would find in Hawaii' but you got to remember you're in the middle of the desert. \n\nAhi Shoryu Poke - Tasted fresh with a slight soy sauce flavor?\n\nDempura? - Fish cakes, tasted just like that which you would get at a Korean restaurant, so if you like those, then you will definitely like this one.\n\nSpicy Combo Poke - The money of all pokes. The slight spicy kick is what really set this poke over the edge. Beware though as this poke is not \""light\"".\n\nRice w/ Furikake - At first I wasn't quite sure if I wanted rice, but after furikake was mentioned I had to get myself an order. For only $1.50 you get a pretty good amount of rice and the furikake adds exceptional taste.\n\nThe one thing that really made Poke Express was the great service. The owner was a nice Hawaiian man who really spent time to explain all the different types of poke and let us try EVERYTHING we wanted to try. He was very patient and definitely made the experience very pleasant for everyone. On top of that he could definitely hold down a good conversation.\n\nOverall: If you love poke than you will love Poke Express."
0,"One of the store managers Tori has the worst customer services. Not to say that all the employees there are that way because I've had other great experiences. I tried to exchange a defected item with a receipt and  she told me \""I used it and I couldn't return it\"" & \""good luck trying to return it at another location.\"" I assume a $22 exchange it's worth the Sephora no hassle motto. I called another location after leaving and explained everything and they took care of me. Sad store."
1,I've taken my dog here twice and both times Melissa has done an incredible job. My dog is not the easiest to handle 1 because he's just a puppy (8 months) and 2 because he's not use to it but his hair cuts always look amazing. She's extremely nice and very informative when I pick my dog up!
0,Went to Town Square location.  Food was adequate...drinks only slightly watered down.  Used a Groupon and what a waste...drinks are outrageously priced!  $22 for a double rum and coke..off the strip at a place that does groupons?  Holy wallet pillaging!  NEVER again will I go here....you've been warned.
0,"It's happening. They're taking over the world. One mall at a time and... it's awful.\n\nAs you would expect, everything is overpriced. Like, way overpriced. My friend really wanted to go (and by friend, I really mean friend, but I admit I kinda wanted to go as well... this is the truth). So we hiked down the not so walking friendly strip all the way from Planet Hollywood down here. \n\nMy friend was going for those face picture mask things. Pretty much a photo on a stick you can hold up to your face so you can be a Kardashian too. For the \""low\"" price of $7, you can own a piece of Kardashian Khaos for yourself. Methinks not.\n\nThe saving grace? The frozen yogurt store across the way. I'd invest in a delicious $7 treat before I'd invest in a $25 dollar Kardashian mug."
0,"When you think of Mandalay Bay, you think high end. Lots of great restaurants, shops, etc.. So when we were in a hurry and wanted a buffet near by, we chose here. \n\nI always regret not looking at Yelp first, but there is no way that a nice upscale hotel like this would have a bad buffet, right? WRONG!\n\nThe place was about 2/3 full, yet we waited for at least 15 min to be seated. The food selection was minimal, and you could tell that it wasn't turning regularly as many of the dishes looked over cooked, and old. As expected, taste was the same. Cold once out from under the heat lamp, soggy, or hard. \n\nWith such a small amount of choices, you would think that it would be easy to keep the name tags in front of the proper food, but most items had the wrong tags and many had none at all.\n\nThe short of it is don't eat here. Go to one of the other restaurants at Mandalay, or if you want a buffet, find a different one down the strip. Very strong chance any of them will be better."
0,"The first time we came here I was astonished. The food was great, service was on par and the atmosphere was good enough. Now....I'd rather spend my money elsewhere. \n\nThe second time we came in for some drinks and appetizers with my parents the service was so bad that I had to put away my OWN menu..after 30 minutes of it sitting in my face and taking up all my space when there was food to eat, I was sick of it. So I put it back...during that entire night I had to round up our server 3 times in order to get her to do anything. Either they were understaffed of she just didn't care...either of which I could believe. The drinks were weak, but the salsa was good so I continued to give it another chance.\n\nThe last time I went in I was disgusted. We sat again in the dinning area and underneath my place mat was old, dried up food from someone else. I didn't order a drink as I have found that the drinks just aren't made correctly. I ordered my favorite from the first time, the chipotle chicken nachos. It was DISGUSTING this time. Some of the chicken was cold, the sauce was gloppy and all together it just didn't taste right."
0,"Please heed my advice!!!!!!!!! Mirage is easily the worst experience with hired help in my life, bar none.\n\nMy home experienced a minor flood that damaged two bedrooms and a bathroom. I was out of town and these hooligans directly talked with my wife. They ensured her fantastic work and a two week timeframe. We'll we are in the middle of June and the work was finally completed, only after thousands of emails and phone calls. That would be almost 3 months for two small rooms.\n\nCraig Herrmann is the owner and showed up. He is a devil in sheeps clothing. He told my wife all the right things and appeared very professional, but that's where it stops with Craig. Shortly after returning home I find what appears to be a convict crew in my house being led by a large and very intimidating strong armed thug named Bill. Bill continually lied, deceived and flat out tried to dupe all involved. He refused to talk to me and would constantly not take my calls or my insurance agents calls. Furthermore Craig and Bill refused on multiple occasions to provide written estimates to the insurance company. This stubbornness only created problems for my family as all worked stopped.\n\nI was told on three occasions by Bill that his employees would be over at 8am sharp. That time usually turned to noon if at all. I had 3 days of call ins to work so work could be done but nobody would show, no phone call or apology. This became the norm for this company.\n\nUsually insurance companies are the difficult side of these accidents but not here. My insurance company tried like hell to release funds to cover the damage but was met by absolute juvenile behavior by Bill and Craig. They had the check ready to be dispursed in late April but Billy boy lied and said the holdup was on the insurance side.\n\nWhen workers did show up they usually stayed a few hours, stated they couldn't speak English and just vanished leaving the job unfinished.\n\nOn to the most disgusting part of this ordeal. I called Craig, the self proclaimed master of disaster to complain. I got out a few sentences before he started yelling at me on the phone about his frustration with the insurance company. He boasted about 20 years in the industry and god like of a business man he was. I then demanded he lower his voice and save the rabble rousing for some other poor sucker he tries to swindle. I asked what part of his twenty years did he learn to scream at a client about a third party. He was dumbfounded, pretty sure he has never been taken to task before. Craig and Bill while trying to scam the insurance comp directly placed his client in a terrible position. His unethical practices only hurt me and my family while all work stopped so he could pout.\n\nDo to this companies shenanigans I had to hire an outside flooring company just so I could finally get my daughter back into her bedroom.\n\nI fired mirage and Craig's thug employees but was still on the hook for the work they did complete. Craig agreed on the price since there was still no formal estimate given. Then I leave town for a funeral and this clown calls me and asks if I have 12,000 dollars for water mitigation. He asked so smugly and with a pompous attitude. I laughed at him and advised that I wasn't slow or elderly, you know the poor folk he most likely rakes over the coals.\n\nI called my insurance company and they stated that a check was sent almost a month ago for 2500 for the water. Craig's 12,000 was audited and denied. Craig refused to cash the check and decided he might take a stab at getting it from me. He is absolutely the shaddiest, ego maniac out there, just take a look at his head shots and YouTube videos.\n\nSo this is my first yelp review and I hope it reaches the Las Vegas Valley before they make the mistake I did in hiring this unethical clown show. In closing, I would trust these guys with cleaning up spilled milk. So much more to write but I feel I would need a novel to explain.\n\nPlease stay away.....far away"
1,"Lots of stuff for even little ones to enjoy! Stopped here to play one day with our 22 month old on our vacation last week.  We live in Indianapolis, home of one of the biggest and best children's museums in the  country, but we were so pleasantly surprised by this museum! Unlike the Indy museum, which is great for \""kids\"" of all ages, the Phoenix children's museum is a great place especially for little ones. I think we hit just about every section.  Our little guy's favorites were the noodle forest (which I thought was really fun too), the tricycle \""carwash\"" lane, the kitchen/market, and the \""floating\"" ping pong ball air tubes. Not too overwhelming for a half day's fun, but we could have easily made a full day out of it. We'll be sure to visit again on our next trip"
1,"We got here right before they open again at 5:30PM and there were already people waiting. We didn't have a reservation but were seated quickly anyhow. It looks like a small restaurant on a large empty strip mall but inside it's considerably spacious and nicely decorated. We ordered the nam kao tod, garlic prawns, crispy duck panang curry, and softshell crab drunken noodles. All were super delicious. Garlic prawns were probably my favorite - it's done so well - super crispy on the outside but perfectly done on the inside. Pricey but still worth it."
0,"I REALLY wanted to like this place.  The cute cashier boy and the fun little stand was a great start; however, the tacos were another story.  I ordered the fish taco and the carna asada taco with green chile.  My tortillas were falling apart from the grease and from the large quantity of the meat, cheese, and cabbage.  That was not too bad but the flavor or the tacos were just plain salty.  So salty that I really couldn't enjoy the beef in my taco.  I tried the fish taco and the fish was \""sick\"" as in not well, and ill.  That's what I call fish when they have this fishy smell that's beyond the normal fish smell.  I know my fish, trust me (I'm Asian okay) and the fish in my taco was just not right.  \n\nGranted the tacos were cheap and the quantity was large; however,  I rather pay more and eat a fish taco that is \""not sick.\"""
0,I figured that I would give RL one more try...can someone say NEVER AGAIN!!!! The Lobster was tough. Matter of fact everything was gross. The waitress gave me some lame a** excuse why the lobster was tough. She forgot our appetizer. She kept forgetting of our requested items. The floor was nasty and the lobby smelled like urine. Do Not mop the lobby with the bathroom mop. My advice is they need to close all the Red Lobsters. So Sad...
0,"Pay attention to their return and exchange policy! What? You can't find it? That's because there is none! Once you bought it and had it delivered, it's yours for better or worse. Even it it broke in 4 days, like mine. They told me that the policy is in writing, but I've never saw it. The only document I have from them is a piece of paper that looks like a restaurant order ticket. That's all!"
1,"After going several times always being served excellent food, I often recommend smashburger to friends.\n\nMy personal favorite is the build your own chicken sandwich. Standouts for me are the spicy chipotle bun and applewood smoked bacon.\n\nMy girlfriend loves their salads and I consider her standards very high. She doesn't often rave about salads unless they are 5 star.\n\nStaff is great and restaurant is clean. Smashburger is defiantly a must try."
1,"If you're a fan of cool coffee shops you'll find that this place has a lot to offer. I guess they are a franchise but they're so small and unknown that they feel more like a small business that offers that personalized touch you won't find at Starbucks. Its nice inside and has a few comfy couches. This is an excellent place to study because it just gives off such a supportive vibe. They've even got some back rooms that can be reserved for various meetings. Note that if I see you talking loudly in the back rooms while I'm trying to study I just might slap you in the face. You can reserve them for ten dollars, which goes onto your saxby card if you have one, and can be immediately spent on coffee and snack items. It's more of a way of ensuring that room denizens buy coffee from the shop instead of just free loading on the space. Wifi is free for paying customers only, and I don't have a problem with that.\n\nI've tried their french roast as well as their bold. Both are excellent, full bodied coffees, and at 2 dollars for a medium you can't go wrong.  Ive yet to  try any of their iced drinks but you had best believe that I'll be having some in the very near future. This place has character and is just the right amount of mellow to make you feel comfortable."
1,I spoke with Shawn on the phone about cleaning my apartment's two bedrooms.  I clean my carpets every year and have received some poor cleanings in the past.   I decided to call these guys and was thoroughly impressed by their professionalism and timeliness.  They were accommodating and worked around my schedule.  Aaron showed up on time and did a fantastic job.  They use only high quality materials which made my carpets cleaner then they have in years.  I am going to be a customer in the future with them.
1,"This will be my regular lunch stop in town.  Probably the one place in UK that beats American BBQ joints... yeah, that good.  Maybe because the first time I had it was freezing cold and late afternoon, but the meat was plenty, tender and juicy.  The chili sauce reminds me of St. Louis bbq.  Sorry, vegetarian friends, pig is the only thing on menu here.  Oh, and expect to eat your sammy standing up."
0,"For Review 200 I wanted to take something from my bookmark list. I was downtown for the Herberger Theater and passed by the Old Spaghetti Factory. I used to visit the OSF in Atlanta and when I lived in Ohio. I remember always enjoying the experience...\n\nNostalgia is better than reality.\n\nMy friend ordered the fettuccini alfredo and I went with the garlic mizithra...which is a twist on the standard mizithra cheese & spaghetti plate I typically order. This added garlic, mushrooms and bacon. The food was good, but fairly average. The portions were smaller than I remembered. \n\nThe sourdough bread was good - still warm. The restaurant opened in 1972 and I think they have been making salads the same way since Day 1. It was an iceberg lettuce classic and although I ordered blue cheese, it arrived with vinaigrette. Rather than send it back I kept the salad. \n\nPerhaps I arrived close to a shift change, but there appeared to be 2 managers on duty, both stopping by the table multiple times to ask \""is everything fantastic?\"" - the waiter stopped by several times as well and said \""Is everything excellent?\"" I like to be checked on occasionally, but too much is annoying.  \n\nAnother annoying aspect was the food had been on the table about 10 minutes and still was 3/4 full, the waiter came back and asked if we needed boxes or were we still working on it? Um...yes, still working.  Maybe it was because it was 5:30 and the lobby was crowded with others waiting, but I hadn't been there that long - and three minutes later when he popped back over and asked again if we were finished, well you just earned yourself a small tip and a long guest because my show didn't start for another 90 minutes and I didn't have anything to do. Deal with it. \n\nFinally I allowed him to take the plates away and we were brought complementary spumoni - I have to say that was the best part of the entire meal. Afterwards I swung by the restroom and that was a charming experience.  Big open urinals - at least it wasn't like the old pee troughs some places used to have - but there it was - a full restroom of guys looking like a locker room. I didn't know my spaghetti came with sausage. Yuck.\n\nOverall - $31 for a hopefully soon forgettable dining experience.  The service from the waiter and the manager(s) was annoying and the meal average at best.  Some memories are best kept as that. I don't think I need to revisit this restaurant any time soon."

1,"Years ago as a kid growing up in Musselburgh, one of the challenges thrown down in front of you would be - which ice cream do you like more, Luca's or Di Rollo's?\n\nHands down, my response for the past 25 *cough cough* years has been Luca's. I wouldn't even sniff in the direction of Di Rollo's. But... you know what, time can change the old taste buds, and I can definitely say now that I have more than a little love for Di Rollo. It tastes creamier, I like the different flavours (raspberry ripple for the win! As is coconut). So now I tend to walk on the wild side, my opinions change, and I go against the tide of Luca's fans. \n\nNom."
0,"This store has an unwelcome attitude towards non-Hispanic customers. Worst of all, they sell fruits that are rotten from the inside. Having to take a lot of Biology and Chemistry classes for my major, I am quite aware of various chemical smell, particularly preservatives which I have noticed on their oranges. I wouldn't doubt that they actually inject formaldehyde into their meat as well, since that distinct, smell is present on their meat."
1,"I was finally able to visit the Trilogy this year after hearing so many good things and positive reviews from within the haunt community and from friends with first hand experiences. I am so glad I finally did!\n\nThis is everything that I have missed about haunted houses. I live in Los Angeles, so there's no shortage of haunts in October, but so many of them are pretty big and hire people that say \""boo\"" and want a paycheck rather than hiring people who love it and get it. Freakling only allows a few people in at a time, so you don't have to worry about getting stuck in a conga line and seeing a scare too early. They also treat everyone equal. I'm a tattooed male and in most haunted houses, I get left alone so they can focus on the screaming girl within the group. Freakling doesn't care at all about who you are or if they think they can/can't scare you...they just go for it and it's amazing!\n\nMost people have covered the separate houses in other reviews. I loved them. So many cool effects and illusions that make you go ...WHOA! I was so impressed with all of them.\n\nNow...The Victim Experience. I wanted to try this last year, but couldn't make a trip to Vegas work. I signed up as soon as tickets went on sale for this year. I did it and survived. I can't talk about what happened inside, but I will say that it was one of the most brutal (mentally and physically) experiences I've ever had. After surviving, I felt like I could take on the world. It was such an accomplishment. If you decide that you want to take on the next level of extreme haunt....I wish you the best! If you survive, you will feel amazing and be part of the Freakling family instantly :)"
0,"Nahh. This is over hyped by media! \nI am not going into too much with this place cause it's not even worth the effort. Plain and simple it sucked. I lived in Mexico for years and this is not very good and the prices suck! \nI was not impressed with anything. The famous guacamole, big whoop. So you put pomegranate seeds in it. WOW! Genius! \nI would never return. I had better...much better!"

1,"I love supporting mom and pop type places! \n\nThis place is right down the street from my work. I stop in maybe only 10 times a year, but every time I do I always ask myself why I dont go back more. \n\nIve only ever gone in the morning for coffee and one of their tasty breakfast sandwiches or fresh bagels! Always amazing! They also have a lunch menu which I have never tried out, I am cheap when it comes to sandwiches and thier prices for that are a touch high, although they do have a program where if you bring in your receipt from your morning coffee you get a discount of some sort. I may have to give it a shot. \n\nThe service is always fast and friendly! It kind of has that Friends coffee shop type vibe going on."
0,"Not the best frozen yogurt. Limited flavor choices and limited toppings. Frozen yogurt was not cool enough and was very runny. If you are looking to get fruits in your yogurt this is not the place, fruits appeared dry and not fresh. A little to pricey I want to say I paid over 40 cents an ounce."
0,"Let's not kid ourselves here - the owner of this place is an Asshole with a capital A.\n\nThe guy simply DOES NOT ALLOW BROWSING in the store. He follows you around, requiring you to be looking for something specific. The merchandise isn't priced, so you have to ask him the price on everything. I happen to know from experience he quotes different people different prices on the same records. On top of that, he's just plain rude, and not even that knowledgeable.. The only reason I can imagine this guy is still in business is that he sold his soul to the devil. Go on any other site and look for reviews of this place. NONE of them are good. This guy is THAT bad.\n\nYou're running a RECORD STORE, jackass. NOT A MUSEUM!\n\nThe actual \""store\"" itself is just a converted house, and it is cluttered as hell. This place would have benefited enormously from being in an actual business space. If you thought those tiny, crowded aisles in Record City were bad, you ain't seen nothing yet. \n\nOh, and did I mention he sells bootleg recordings in the store? Last time I checked that was illegal.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague! You'll be ripped off, chewed out, and put down by a guy who couldn't give the real record store experience if it crawled up and bit him. It's times like this i wish I could give less than one star.\n\nSelection: B-\nService: F"

1,"I was referred here by my twin, Alicia R., who comes here for her pedicures.  It's not on my side of town, but I'll definitely be back because:\n-the owners, John and Christine, are the nicest couple, welcoming and attentive\n-the massage chairs are fabulous!  They even massage your backside--my usual place doesn't have chairs like that.\n-for $25 (plus tip), I got an hour-long pedi that included a citrus sugar scrub, hot towels, a foot/leg massage, and funny, interesting convo with John.\nThis place is only about 6 months old, so come out and visit for some pampering. Calling for an appointment is recommended since it's just the two owners attending to your needs. I even convinced the b/f to have his first pedi and now he's a fan, too.

1,Wonderful experience.  The 3d movie at the beginning really sets the stage for going in.  Once in the variety of butterflies was amazing.  Wear bright colors if you want them to land on you.  Great photo opportunities.  There is a small cafeteria if you want to take a break and go back in.
0,"We had the Queso Fundido with Taquitos for an appetizer. The dip was great and the chips were great, but the taquitos were dry and boring. For entrees, we had the mole, which was good, but not great. We also had the mango, chipotle chicken and the sauce was great, but the chicken was dry and overcooked. None of the flavor was soaked into the chicken, so it tasted bland.\n\nAs others have said, the entrees are very large, so that is a plus.\n\nWe would like to come back and try happy hour and some \""safer\"" entrees such as the chimichanga and hopefully they will be better executed."
0,"I stayed at the Luxor for the first time last weekend. We had a standard pyramid room for the first two nights and a deluxe room for the last.\n\nThe lobby looks old and out dated. The elevators are slow, shaky and nerve wracking because they go diagonally instead of straight up and down. In one elevator the casing was loose and we were able to move it! cheesy!\n\nThe elevators are super far from most of the rooms, it takes forever to get to and from them. The rooms are OK but worth a lot less than what you pay for.\n\nThe beds feel like a old futon and they give you cheap sheets- no comforters\n\nOn the last night I used the hot tub, one minute into it the water started turning green!! DISGUSTING!!\n\nPlus to top it off its far from everything on the strip, for the money you pay, you can get something way better.\n\nNever staying there again."
1,"I really love Urban Angel. During the day it's a friendly little caf\u00e9 selling super tasty organic cakes, brunch, sandwiches and light meals. They try to source ingredients locally and use organic and free range produce wherever possible. In the evening it turns into an equally friendly neighbourhood bistro offering meals like organic lamb meatballs and scallop, smoked haddock and crayfish chowder. It still manages to retain the caf\u00e9 vibe and I have no qualms about coming in here on my own to tap away at the laptop whilst enjoying a (large) glass of Merlot and a piece of cake; no mean feat in this area of town. This is a sophisticated eatery for those who enjoy dining with a clear conscience."
1,Food was great - service was thoughtful and prompt.  Probably won't get the pizza again but the mussel special was so very tasty.  The other dishes brought out to neighboring tables looked really good.  Don't hesitate to go...\n\nIt's just a shame that they had to resort to getting publicity through the fake 'reality' show called Undercover Diners.  So fake - it was horrible acting.  They are better than that....
1,"Friendly, quick and super efficient! \nHighly recommend!"
1,This was my second time here and it was the same as the last time which I appreciate. We were met at the door with a friendly smile and seated quickly. The place was packed with people which was nice. \n\nI ordered the original 3 pieces of fried chicken with two waffles aka the lo lo. The chicken was very good with great flavor and cooked perfectly. The waffles were the same as the last time. Good but not great. I would expect more from the waffles due to the fact that the word is in the name of the restaurant but overall they are fine. The kool aid was great with zero complaints about it. \n\nOverall this place is very good and worth the time it takes to drive down to south Phoenix.  I will certainly come back if I'm in the area.
0,"Lipstick on a pig!  What a huge disappointment.  Only a few rooms actually renovated but they BS you and con you when taking reservations and on their website, then hassle you when you check in and find out your room is not one of the 'newly renovated' rooms - a rip off!.  Renovations are minimal.  Showerhead sucked; one sink; nice 40\"" TV, but without HD signals why bother?  They invested minimal $ to renovate the old Alladin - would not recommend this dump to anyone!  Spend a few more bucks and stay anywhere else.   The Spice Market Buffet sucks - buried down in the basement/lower level; high walls make it way to claustrophobic and the food sucks as does the service. Best thing about the stay....Rudy the bellman took care of us big time with limo's, etc...he needs to move to a nicer property to make more money.\n\nCasino was ok, Heart Bar was fun and packed, go-go dancers a nice touch but not a big deal; sports bar (Xtra lounge) is too small but make a good bloody mary on Sunday mornings; go visit but don't stay here."
0,"This place is terrible from the furnishings to the food! The place looks like a diner from the 70's, and no this is not a good thing! It even has a musty smell to it, gross! Ok, on to the food.. We had a cheese crisp appetizer which was not bad. The chips and salsa were also not bad. So far so good, right?! WRONG! Next up, our entrees. I had two ground beef tacos which were disgusting! I am not even sure the ground beef was really beef?! My boyfriend ordered the ultimate fajitas, which included chicken, steak and shrimp. This came to the table sizzling, hmm... maybe this would be good?! Nope, all three meats were terrible! Very salty and chewy! My son ordered country fried steak...This was god aweful! Our bill before a tip was $47! What a waste!! Do not step foot in this place, you will regret it!"
1,"I had to update my review from 4 to 5 stars. Every-time I come it keeps getting better and better! Not only are the flavors delicious and unique, the staff are super friendly and the store frequently has coupons and special discount days. Our family LOVES this place!!!!"
1,"We always pregame for Bobcats games at Queen City Q.  BBQ restaurants are famous for quick service and QCQ is no slouch!  This really helps with dinner before a 7pm weeknight game.\n\nDuring our last visit I tried a bowl of their Brunswick stew and it was very good, but the serving size was less than I hoped for.  For $2 more I could have ordered a quarter chicken with two sides and been very satisfied.  Oh well, I will know for next time!"
1,"I'd always really thought of Whighams of a place for after work drinks rather than a restaurant but having recently dinned here I was pleasantly surprised at how well both elements of the place work together. \n\nThe sunken alcoves, that I'm assuming previously held wine barrels when it actually was a wine cellar, have a lovely cosy feel to them which is great if you have one to yourself. Sharing one with complete strangers however can feel a little awkward depending on your company as the music and chatter of the bar is really subdued in the little alcoves, so they can hear everything you're talking about. (Thankfully I've usually been sitting with a loud, exuberant group who's rowdiness tended to scare off anyone foolish enough to try and sit with us.) As you would expect the place has a good wine list and also provides a very nice list of cocktails. If the weather is nice there is also a teeny tiny beer garden that you can sit it, though it is usually full of smokers.\n\n The restaurant area is separated off a little from the main bar so it's not quite in the thick of things, though I wouldn't really want to eat here in the evenings on a weekend given how busy the bar gets. On the Wednesday I came in here for food the place was quite quiet and my friend and I got tucked away in a nice wee corner away from the hubbub of the bar. Seafood seems to be a speciality here with lots of fresh and enticing options on the menu. I opted for mussels while my friend had some oysters followed up with langoustines and pasta for mains. The food is lovely and it was nice to find a decent seafood restaurant outside of Leith. I'll probably stick to drinking here as opposed to eating but it's a lovely place to spend some time if you're in the West End."
1,I was fairly impressed with their food.  Appetizers were fresh and well prepared.  Service was perfect.  Sushi was fresh and very well seasoned.  Only critique I would have was that the rice was on the mushy side.
1,"Somewhat lower priced birth control, with really long waits.  The centers are pretty much all the same here, just with different hours.  The staff is friiendly, but so slow you'd think they're actually MAKING your pills from scratch in the back.  But, they are more affordable than your regular doc if you don't have insurance."
1,"This is my go to spot when I am in the mood for sports bar food and atmosphere. A Blue Moon on tap with an orange slice, to go with some of the golden wings is the perfect combination for me. Zipps is one of my top spots in the valley when it comes to wings. If you are looking at something more for dinner the rest of the menu doesn't disappoint. The salads and burgers are great, but if you are looking for that one thing on the menu you have to try, its the Monaco foccacia. When I go to this place with 8 friends, 7 are getting the Monaco. As good as everything else on the menu is, I rarely venture away from the Monaco. The happy hour here is nothing mind blowing, but def worth checking out, $5 for a dozen wings and a few bucks for a 32oz domestic beer make it a budget friendly dinner before 7.\n\nThe food here is 5 stars for me. My one qualm with this place is they will charge you for every extra thing you order. We ask for an extra side of ranch and some celery..$3 dollars. And if you plan on splitting something, expect to pay extra. I worked at a restaurant under the same owners and they take off 7 dollars from every employees paycheck as a drink charge whether you drink from the soda fountain or not. point is these owners will nickel and dime you for every cent they can get.  \n\nOverall if you want a great sports bar to eat at, or a place to catch a game, this is the place you want to go."
1,"New year, new clothes, time to update my closet.  A great way to sell some clothes for cash is at Buffalo Exchange.  They give you 33% for the value of the clothes or 50% for in store credit.  The staffs are so friendly.  I just love the store that doesn't smell like something died like other consignment stores."
0,"I made a Yelp account just so I could review this place and warn other people how HORRIBLE this place is. First of all, the drinks tasted like they were made with powder. Gross. Second, the boba was so hard I couldn't eat them. Also, when we ordered, we specifically said \""To Go\"" but they gave us the glass cups instead. So when we clarified the second time it was to go, they gave us plastic cups and told us to pour it out ourselves. Also, after seating us, and after being seated for about fifteen minutes, the waiter then told us to get up and move down because he needed to seat other guests. I was tired of the lousy customer service so we got up to pay, and we stood in front of the register for a good ten minutes while the waiters just kept walking past us. One of them even bumped into me. NEVER EVER EVER coming back here. It is way over priced. Spent $50 for the WORST customer service experience I've ever had. That's $50 I'm never going to get back. If I could, I would give this place no stars at all. They are so rude. DO NOT COME HERE! Go to Icy Juicy down the street, it is much much better. This place is ridiculous."
0,I have been a customer in this shop for the last 38 years.  I have literally bought a dozen or more new and used bikes.  Last time I was in I traded a bike that I know he made approximately $200 on resale.  Today the young man there treated me with dis-respect and tried to insult my intelligence.  I wanted to tell him that I had forgotten more than he knows.  I will never spend another $1 on sales or service at this place and I was a regular customer
0,"This new pizza place is where Devil's Pizza Factory used to be. Receipts still say Devil's Pizza Factory on them in fact.\n\nUnlike Devil's that made varying shades of bad to decent pizza for $6 a pie, this place makes bad pizza for $10-$13 a pie.\n\nI ordered one of the 'special pizzas' and found that the dough was not particularly good and it really just tasted like salt. It also filled a napkin with grease that we dabbed off.\n\nThe in store service was very nice, but the pizza was not good enough to try again."
1,Had a great time with my family at the festival.   All the food was delicious with large portions... but considering how many things you'll want to try I think I would have rather had smaller portions and cheaper prices. Ended up spending a fortune!
0,"I have been to Humble Pie three times now. The first time was take out pizza, and I was helped promptly upon arriving at the restaurant. I was not very impressed with the pizza, although I came back to dine in to give it another chance. My boyfriend and I ate at the bar. I enjoyed the toasted ravioli appetizer, and the Schreiner's Italian Sausage was average. There are so many other pizza places in the area that make a better pizza with high quality ingredients. My third visit; however, was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had.\n\nI went in on a Friday after work for happy hour with 6 co-workers. All but one drink came out in a timely manner, although 3 waters took quite some time. Our food arrived and we were missing one appetizer and two pizzas. I spoke to our server to inform him we were missing some items, including the water and drink. He said we only ordered one of the two missing pizzas and I assured him we had ordered two. Everything except the second pizza arrived. When we asked for it, our server's comment hinted at disbelief as if we ate it and lied! At the end of dinner, we still had not received the pizza. We ordered 2 to go orders and one dessert. The to go orders came out in regular dishes, we asked for them to go and asked for the dessert and the elusive pizza. We received the to go dinners, but no pizza or dessert. When one person asked for the check, our server made a comment in a rude tone about how she probably wants to pay for her portion out of all 7 and asked if she knew what she ordered. At that point we asked a food runner for a manager and our server was brought over. We insisted to talk to a manager. The manager finally came to our table, apologized profusely, took off the pizza and dessert from our bill, and made sure we had all items requested. He also was kind enough to give us coupons for a free pizza when we spend a minimum of $20!"
0,"I'd like to preface this review by saying that a rating of 2 stars is based on service and service only. The food I had at this bakery was quite good, but the lady serving ruined my experience. I don't expect mile wide smiles everywhere I go - but at least neutrality is a must. \n\nI walked in with a friend. She ordered only tea and got a skeptical \""is that all look\"". I got a tea, sandwich, and eclair. The eclair was heaven on earth. I would recommend their baked goods any day. The sandwich was OK. I asked to get it warmed up and mentioned I didn't like cold meat. When I got it at the table, my meat was cold. I walked up and politely asked to have it reheated.  When I got it, it was burnt to a crisp. On top of that, the lady sarcastically asked me if the sandwich was *still* too cold, that I should bring it back again.  That really irked me. She didn't have to say anything. She could have put it down and walked away. I was saddened by my overall experience. I recommend this place for taste only - or if you avoid getting the female server."
0,"Appalling bar. My friend got his jaw broken and wallet stolen in the toilets, told the bouncers but they were reluctant to do anything about it and as a result the 2 men walked out, and attacked another person up the street. \nThe drinks are cheap but it's not worth it for the awful music and general violent ambiance in there."
1,"BEST Vegas show I've seen so far!!! I LOVED this show!  Funny, sexy, entertaining, amazing acrobatics. \n\nWhat I like about this show is that they talk and interact with the audience, which is very different from all the other cirque du soleil. I've seen Le Reve (4/5) and KA (3/5), and I enjoyed this show the best because it was so dynamic. Le Reve was beautiful, KA had a good story, Zumanity was just so funny, a lot of fun, PLUS had amazing acrobatics! Cheaper than the other ones too! My ticket was originally 90 something, paid $82 with tax and fees included through the tix4tonight booth. \n\nBut this show is all sex, and you see lots of boobies and maybe even penis', so leave your kids at home!! And enjoy the show ;)"
1,"Really surprised by my experience here. Yes, it is Pizza Express, but the make over with the modern d\u00e9cor and pretty comfortable chairs, then I was happy to dine here and what is more, I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe new gluten free options means that I had choice here and I thought the pizza was pretty yummy. It is a standard base used - no options on size and thickness but it is thin and crispy, with the right amount of crunch. There are a good range of toppings available (sadly no Sloppy Giuseppe) and my la Reina was tasty and well covered with toppings.\n\nA nice addition is the mini bites with coffee. Dessert is available but you can also get coffee with a range of mini desserts when you want something sweet but can't face a full dessert. There is an option of a gluten free brownie and despite my brownie fatigue, it was really good and just enough to round off a meal.\n\nSo as Claire C has mentioned, there's deals aplenty for Pizza Express so its worth checking before heading here but for tasty food, good service and nice surroundings then it is worth a visit. And for sunny nights, the outdoor seating at The Shore is lovely."
1,Thumbs Up!\n\nI vouch you won't find a better margherita pizza or meatballs surrounded by more TV's in your life.
1,"These guys are top notch.  First, to be clear, I drive a 2006 Jeep Liberty 4x4 NOT. A German car. With that said, I have an awesome (but very rare) European diesel version with a 2.8 liter VMotori  turbo diesel.  The Jeep dealers hate it because they don't really have any true diesel techs. The big diesel specialists only know Ford, Dodge, and Chevy and don't understand small European diesels. I found these guys on a Jeep CRD forum recommending them for local shop that will do honest, high quality work. (And the owner's wife has the same CRD Jeep as me, so he knows it top to bottom.)\n\nThere is no one else in the state of Arizona that I trust to work on my little Jeep. End of story. Finding a good, honest, high quality, mechanic that you can trust is like finding a great doctor, lawyer, dentist, or accountant- with Dan and his crew you know your in the hands of a real professional with ethics and who takes pride in their work.  \n\nAnd BTW- I make the 40 minute drive from North Scottsdale passing by a hundred mechanics/garages/dealers just to take it to a real pro!\n\nThanks guys!"
0,"I don't know how this place has stayed in business for so long.  It has never appealed to me, yet some family member drags me there every five years or so.  It never changes. It seems like an independently owned Chili's.  The menu is boring.  The food nothing special.  \n\nMost recently, I ordered a salad and asked for some rolls or bread and they didn't have anything except for some super spongy Italian sliced bread that tasted like a step up from wonder bread.  My beet salad had such crunch beets they were barely cooked.  Grapefruit segments were all membrane.  Lettuce was ice cold, nearly frozen.  \n\nSee you in another five years."
1,"Be ready to sign over your first born but it is totally worth it.  The food, the service, the atmosphere and lastly the view all combine to one of the best dinning experiences of my life! No walls, just massive glass windows that let you peer in every direction over the Las Vegas Valley. When we visited, we did the Alain Ducasse Grand Tasting Menu. Completely worth the price and the additional wine pairing was spot on. If you have a chance, go there. NOW!"
0,"This was a bad joke. Went here excited with family for lunch and spent $130 on very subpar food and drinks. Even though the lagoon is drained and there is no Pirate show, the prices are still ridiculously high for Las Vegas.\n\nMy wife's margarita that she couldn't get down because it tasted like sour patch kids with no alcohol was $27, my basic nachos with beef were $20, wife's chimi was $20, basic burger 20 bucks, you get it.  Kids virgin margarita 10 bucks and neither of my kids would drink them because they didn't taste good.\n\nNot sure how they can get away with charging these prices with average food and subpar drinks while under construction.  Left really pissed off."
0,"You failed me for the last time Wok Box.\n\nTony, I'm calling you out brotha! \n\nListen to your customers, man. We're not happy. \n\nToday on my lunch I ordered the Jungle Lemongrass and 3 piece Chicken Gyoza. \n\nI appreciate that got the last order of  Gyoza and your manager Comp'd me 2 Spring Rolls because guy only had 2 Gyoza left. That's great, awesome customer service. \n\nAnd here's the  \""But\"".  \n\nBut when I get back to my office, I open my lemongrass and find The top is covered with Rotting Cilantro. \n\nI'm like: What the...? No way. \n\nI pick through it, thinking yeah it's late in the day, herbs get cut in morning, there's probably only a little dark or a few black pieces. \n\n...newp. \n\nThe entire garnish is black. Some are even slimy. \n\nSee, I'm trying to rationalize this because the chef wasn't busy. It's 4:3o pm. On a Monday at San Tan Village. This place is a ghost town minus some blue bloods zombie'ing around. I was literally the only one in-what I'm gonna loosely call a \""Restaurant\"" here. \n\nSo I've got to wonder, see this is the part I can't seem to puzzle through: the Chef played that. Each ingredient, added by hand, exacting the right amount of flavors from each. Each ingredients precariously balancing the other, raising each note above the next, simultaneously calling back--a fugue to the original chord ... and your chef thought that placing rotting Cilantro on top was the keystone holding this flavor profile together? \n\nI can still picture him in the kitchen all like: \""this cilantro is gunna add the right amount of Swamp to this. I'm coming for you, Bobby Flay!\"" \n\nA month ago I had your Beef Pho. I'd rather drive to  Da Vang in Phoenix. They may have roaches but at least they've mastered the Ancient Art of Flavoring. Who knows, maybe the roaches are secret ingredient handed down from generation-to-generation by Th\u00edck Qu\u00e1ng Da Vang the Elder. Whatever it is, you need to get some. \n\nAnd today's mess: Jungle Lemongrass with a side of Chicken Gyoza & spring Rolls...I'm done man. I tried. The spring rolls were a oily bog. Chef shortcut couldn't take a second to rest them on a towel and soak some of that grease trap up? \n\nThey're are three things you can't do in this industry: shortcut talent, shortcut ingredients and shortcut your customers. Every time we eat at your establishment we are investing in your idea; your creative vision. \n\nWe are shareholders in your dream. \n\nNot anymore. \n\nBusiness 101 teaches us that within a the first 2 years, are the hardest for any restaurant and the time when 90% close their doors. You've been open a year. If you're still open in a year's time, I'll give you another try. \n\nIf you're not, then We'll both know why. \n\nI'm not looking for hand-outs and I don't want your apology and a free lunch voucher. That's not what I'm about. \n\nListen to your reviews, bro. They're all the same. Repetitive. Over and over your customers are saying the same things. And I'm sure I know what you're thinking, but we can't ALL be wrong. \n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I've gotta make my way to the restroom. See, I made the mistake is eating some of your food."
1,"It's so nice to stroll around this old pecan farm. You really feel like you're in the rural country side. I love the garden, the towering trees, the shade. It's lovely. \nBest chocolate cake I've ever had is from here. And amazing soup and sandwiches. A little more on the pricier side, but worth it. \nI've been a couple times and have never had a bad experience with service. It's too bad they shut down in the summer. I understand during the day, but in the evening this place would be delightful to have dinner."
0,"Horrible place.  I threw a party for work in Vegas and had to get some brochures printed here.  I will never use this place again.  They over charged, provided poor quality printing services and wouldn't refund us for their bad work.  \n\nThese people changed out the expensive paper I asked for with cheap paper and tried to tell me that no one could tell the difference anyway.  Well, I paid for the expensive paper and I could tell the difference and so could our clients.\n\nI'll go anywhere but here in the future."
1,"A special meal, a lovely view, attentive and informative service.  It ALMOST made me forget the price, ha ha.\n\nOur table's appetizers included the vegetable risotto, the cocotte (parmigiano custard), and my favorite: the rabbit. \n\nI am very happy that we tried the aragosta spiny lobsters, who apparently had been in the Mediterranean Sea the prior day.  I particularly liked the citrus agrumi preparation.  My daughter (8) enjoyed the smaller cicala slipper lobster. \n\nEverything was prepared wonderfully--the risotto was perfect, for example. For the lobsters, we had them shelled for us tableside, and they were each delicious.  I am not sure that I was able to detect flavor differences with local seafood from the northeast, but the preparation was great, and of course there was simply the novelty of tasting recently-in-the-Mediterranean lobsters.\n\nAll in all, a memorable night!"
0,"Came in on a quiet Sunday night for my first time with some family.  Here's how the meals went...2 pasta dishes, both room temperature, 1 pear salad in which they forgot the pears, one fish and chips which was ok, and the best of all...a children's corn dog served STILL FROZEN!!!  Yep, the corn dog was still ice cold and frozen!  The server said something about problems in the kitchen (really?), but that doesn't help me.\n\nWe sent EVERYTHING back.  Second time around everything was better, but by then...\n\nThe server was good, and the manager gave us desserts for our aggravation, but I still don't think I'll be going back any time soon. It was a $90.00 meal that was not worth it all.  Rather than giving us desserts, the meals should have been comped, in hopes we would try again.  But I won't."
1,Had our 30th wedding anniversary dinner at Mon Ami Gabi and all I can say is WOW!\nStaff was great as was the food. Be sure to get there early to sit on the patio along Las Vegas Blvd!  Life doesn't get any better.
0,"I was not impressed by Bradbury's. The atmosphere was cool, but the seating situation was not ideal. Considering how long it took me to get my meal (which was just tea and a crepe), the lack of chairs without back support was kind of a bummer. I agree with earlier reviewers that the staff was pretty stand-offish; they seemed awfully tense for people who get to make crepes for a living. As far as the crepes themselves go: they were crepes. Standard, middle-of-the-line crepes. I ordered a sweet rhubarb crepe and tried some of my friend's trout crepe, and both of them were pretty average. They were good, but hardly worth the prices that were charged for them. \n\nBradbury's: All I'm saying is you can get comparable crepes elsewhere without the uncomfortable seats and snobby staff."
1,"Love the St Louis ribs,  not crazy about the beef ribs though.  The best cornbread! Service is usually good, and the prices are reasonable for the quality. A great neighborhood joint."
0,"Stopped in here for lunch today, joined by Mike C. & Jackie C.\n\nI had a regular Gyro, which comes with a Greek Salad.  It was good, and the service was ok.  There were some negatives, though:\n\n*  They opened 15 minutes late, & even that was with having go to ask the snarky gal working in the take-out room when they were going to open the dining room.     :-(\n\n*  The restaurant itself has a bar & the whole room was kind of dark, boozy smelling & run down...  wobbly tables, etc.  Not my style.     :-|\n\nWe were the only customers during our lunch visit.\n\nClassic Gyro & Side Salad:  $7.99"
0,"This Panda is close to home, but has the poorest quality of the half a dozen or so Panda's I've been to. I really wanted some Panda so I gave it another try at this location and received an all time low with no shrimp in the surf & turf and really hot orange chicken on over cooked noodles (rubber)."
1,Great place for gel nails! . Brandy does an awesome job!  She really knows how to apply the gel... They last forever and the color keeps my nails perfect for a month or more! I havent broken a nail since I stared going there over a year ago. Love the gel..  makes my natural nails stronger and grow faster.  My nails aways look great and I get tons of complements.  I wound never go anywhere else for a gel fill manicure.
1,"Check this place out for an inexpensive lunch. Prices are good and portions are large. I especially enjoy their pork chops, mashed potatoes, green beans lunch special. It is served with a large slice of bread.  Wait staff is friendly and food shows up quickly after ordering. The Taco salad is also a good choice. \n Haven't been there in the evenings so I can't comment on drinks or the crowd atmosphere."
0,"Did not like this place at all. It was small and very empty. Now this could be that it was a tad early in the evening, but we left and went right to the mirage's other club, and it had a lot of people and was a lot more fun (5 minutes after this place).  So, not sure what the story was on that."
1,"I don't know what they've done, but this place has SERIOUSLY improved their food over the past year. I was wary to try it again since the first time I went (yes, over a year ago) it was less-than mediocre. I live less than a mile away, was jonesing for indian food one day, and didn't want to drive far. I forced myself to go here and am now completely ecstatic that there's an indian food joint I can walk to, gorge myself, and roll my arse home. \n\nThe menu is standard, but somehow a little better because they offer dishes that have subtle differences. HMMM, let's see. I don't know if i'm going to describe this correctly:\n\nOkay, I'm a vegetarian - DON'T STOP READING THIS, DAMNIT! I know what good food is!\n\nStarting over - I'm a vegetarian, and I eat A LOT of indian food, and I have eaten at a lot of indian food places. I don't claim to be an indian foodie, but I do know that the vegetarian dishes have subtle differences so I think some places omit the dishes that are similar and just hope that people who come in order the thing that's closest to the thing they really wanted. There's one dish I always order - paneer (tikka) masala, that some places don't have so I order the closest thing to it, and of course I can't remember it right now but it's another paneer dish with a tomato base that's similar. The thing that's awesome about this place is that it has BOTH, as well as other dishes that other restaurants sometimes don't put on the menu. You know what I mean?\n\nWho cares if you know what I mean - FOUR STARS!"
0,"This place was highly recommended by our friends and we were hoping to also like it. First off, I called and asked if I could bring a small birthday cake for my husband's birthday. The lady on the phone said it was not an issue. We got there and it was packed on a Friday night. The hostess said it would be 20 minutes for a table. Literally two seconds later, there was a four person table cleared. I asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us. The place was busy and noisy.  The menu was limited and average priced for most items. I craved noodles so ordered the Pad-Seiw. The noodles were alright. Somehow seems like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower. The hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice.  Later our server later came back to tell us that they were going to charge us 5 dollars for bringing our own cake. Nice how that was not mentioned on the phone or when she first took the cake to the fridge for us.  So sadly we will not be returning. Thai Rama has much better food and service."
1,Great as always
0,"No taste what so ever in any of our food. We ordered 3 different kinds of \""shaak\"" n all of them tasteless. Even the customer service was bad. We had to ask for water 2 or 3 time. No one even come to ask how was the food.  Very disappointed."
1,"liked the location around the San tan mall and this one is just as awesome. definitely more geriatrics at this one but way better seating and much shorter wait times. I guess to offset the blue hairs they hire exclusively high school girls to serve, but the visual drama this schism creates (the ravenous dead being served by the vitality of youth) only enhances your dining experience.  also they have a ton of local microbrews all on draft"
0,"I went because I won free tickets. However, after going this year I feel bad for anyone that actually pays to get it. Everything is outrageously priced, parking is ridiculous. You have to park a half mile away and walk to the festival. They have shuttles but they are either mini cars or golf carts and only could carry a couple of people at a time. Oh, its also $6 to park!! Parking should be FREE AT THIS EVENT. \nBeers were 6 bucks and you needed tickets. If you like Irish music than I guess this might be your forte. It was either too hot or too loud for me to sit and actually listen to a particular band. The baileys Irish cream ice cream was delectable , $5 for 2 scoops. I probably won't be back, we stayed less than 2 hours and I didn't leave happy. Sorry, these festivals around the Pittsburgh area are insanely priced, I don't understand how they can keep coming back every year!!"
0,nothing to eat for lunch! I rate 0 star. do not be fooled by reviews. This one is far worse than Bacchanal in Caesars. never come back here again
1,"Whether a commited cyclist or just curious about what cycling has to offer you could do a lot worse than pay these guys a visit.The staff are cheery, approachable and knowledgable.Their own brand goods represent value for money. \n\nThey stock everything from entry level bikes and kit under their own brand \""Revolution\"", up to top end kit from Specialized and niche manufacturers like Van Nicholas. The store is really nicely laid out and does not have the dusty dingy feel of other stores.\n\nI have spent quite a lot here over the years and most often use it as a bit of a benchmark for what's available."
0,"After a visit to Glittering lights we were looking for a place to eat and so hungry we stopped at the first place.  Well after years of looking, I finally found a place with a worse buffet than circus circus.  There was litterally nothing edible other than the salad which was borderline. If you are on a diet, this is the buffet for you.   They had several things that were unidentifiable.  We couldn't even eat the soup.\n\nDissapointing because the concept seemed good and the kitch level is mid to high."
0,We knew this was a scam but we didn't realize how badly we'd be scammed. Avoid avoid avoid!
0,"WARNING! Worst overall service EVER!! This place is the ultimate NO! every one star comment is unfortunately true and it's so sad I went through FTD online. I bought \""the best\"" for $100 for mothers day. I live in Seattle and my mom lives in Vegas. ON MOTHERS DAY some guy called saying he was lost he needed help locating the recipients address. He claimed he wasn't even an employee but a friend helping the owner!! Then when I stop what I am doing I am in a panic worried that my mom won't get her bouquet I rush to the computer to help him find it. He said \""WOW that's really far uummm let me call my \""boss\"" (I thought you were a friend??) so he said he would call me back. He didn't so I called the number back and he said he would have his \""boss\"" call me. She never called. I called the number on the business website and a personal voicemail answered. After spending all day on the phone with FTD, FTD even trying to contact them, no delivery no communication, This place SUCKS."
0,"I've eaten at their other location on Smoke Ranch, it was fine. This place was so disorganized it's hard to believe they're still in business! We were the only customers in the place, it took 10 minutes to get a water, milk and tea. We ordered 2 hamburgers and one breakfast. One hamburger and the breakfast came out, it took about 8 minutes to get the second burger, which was very mediocre. .???  What's going on in their kitchen? Later in the day, I got sick from the food. Cross contamination is my guess. Go elsewhere. This place does not have their act together."
1,"For the last few years this has been my favorite Thai food restaurant in the Phoenix area, but it is starting to slip. The food has been so good that to this point it has overcome the poor service. As much as it pains me to say, I am not sure how long that will be the case. I rate the food a 5, but the service a 1. My favorite dishes are the Pad Kee Moa, Evil Jungle Princess, and the Panang Curry. The food has great flavor, with just the right amount of spice. My wife's favorites are the yellow curry and the noodle soup with chicken. The owner and her staff are very nice, but the service is poor to say the least. It can take a very long time to get seated, even when they have many tables available. It can also take a while to get your order taken. Once you get your food, you many not see your server again until it is time to get the check. Overall they are not very attentive... but the food is amazing."
1,"This has to be one of my favorite show in Vegas. It's unique, entertaining and funny. If you like loud music, bright colors, abstract art, and paint, you can't miss it! It's just a bunch of guys in blue paint that does weird things. You will see a lot of musical stuff in this show. Not slow, sleepy music, but rock and roll type with good beats.\n\nIf you want close up action, get tickets for the first few rows. They will provide you with a poncho to protect you from the paint! If you don't want to get splattered on, don't get seats up to close. Rows 7 and beyond should be good.\n\nI did not expect the Blue Man Group to be so entertaining. I strongly recommend you don't miss this the next time you're in Vegas."
0,"i donno if i just didn't go in on a good day, but eh. We had ordered sichuan beef and general chicken...it tasted exactly the same. Salty and not spicy at all. Fried wontons I couldn't even chew.  The Lettuce wraps were ok...little bland. Only good thing that we ate all of was the hot and sour soup. Everything else we sadly threw away."
0,"Beers were great.  Nachos not so much.  I was a big fan of the HOB prior to it closing and reopening.  Chris (our waiter) was very friendly, helpful and generally great.  However the nachos left alot to be desired.  There was both cheese sauce and cheese on them.  Super weird.  The steak was of much poorer quality than when I used to frequent House of Brews.  I am hoping with was a 1 off bad experience.  I plan on going back but next time ordering something different."
1,"Bon choix pour le brunch dans le quartier. Les endroits conviviaux ne sont pas l\u00e9gion dans les environs pour un d\u00e9jeuner copieux et recherch\u00e9, le Valois est donc devenu la suggestion par d\u00e9faut lorsque je ne veux pas me casser la t\u00eate et bien manger. La terrasse l'\u00e9t\u00e9 est agr\u00e9able."
1,"Where do you go when your washer and dryer break down?\n\nHow about Starcrest, which can boast it's own little \""study room\"" with two desks, four chairs, and free wi-fi?  That's right.  I like to surf the net while separating my whites from the colors.  And no, that's not racist.\n\nThe washers are expensive--at least by my standards--$1.50 a wash, but they fit in more than your average washer.  Dryers are about 25 centers per 7 minutes, but are HUMONGONORMOUS, so all told, washing two loads of laundry came to $3 in washing and $1.75 in drying (all of it fit in that one dryer and i let it run for 49 mins).\n\nThe laundromat is clean and big, so that's a plus.  Also, the wi-fi network....is named \""Chuck likes Guys\""  Um, wow Chuck.  Thanks for letting us all know via internet.  We're very happy for you.  Seriously, perhaps a greeting card would've better.  I imagine Hallmark making the card, where the front would be a peaceful lake with the words: \""Life has some surprises.\""  Then the inside: \""Like my newfound attraction to men.\""\n\nBut since Hallmark isnt' yet that edgy, we have starcrest's wireless to make the announcements for us."
1,"We went at prime time for dinner. The place was so full we had to wait 45 minutes for a table.\n\nOnce we were seated though the place was great. Service was good though a bit slow at times, the waiter was really passionate about the food and was able to recommend several options for my parents who don't normally eat Italian. \n\nWe ordered the osso buco, the shrimp scampi, and the gravy with rigatoni. All the food came out hot, and parmesan was very quick to be offered.\n\nThe food tasted great. Like the waiter said, the osso buco literally fell off the bone, I didn't need the knife at all. It was a bit oily, but otherwise very good. The polenta it was served with was creamy and well seasoned. I felt some vegetables/salad would have gone down nicely, but it was very good overall.\n\nThe shrimp scampi tasted very good, but the pasta seemed slightly overcooked (by maybe half a minute) and the sauce a little scarce. Flavour wise it was brilliant. \n\nThe gravy was probably the least impressive in my opinion, the sauce just needed something extra in terms of flavour to really make the meat stand out.\n\nPortion sizes were generous, originally we were keen for dessert or a visit to the cake store just opposite, but it was a bit too much. \n\nOverall it was a very good meal and one of the few decent Italian places I've been to in Vegas or anywhere else and it shows in how busy they were, but it seemed slightly let down by some small details."
0,"Poor service on multiple visits so it's time for an update.  The most recent involved being seated at the bar with no acknowledgment from the bartender who then left the bar for a several minutes.  No greeting.  No drink order.  Nothing.  Did I not exist?  What if the other patrons at the bar needed something?  For the quasi-upscale places like this, you simply should not experience this sort of thing.  Ever.  I walked.\n\nThey're also hyping their Herradura tequila bottled for them, but they embarrass themselves by serving it chilled.  This isn't vodka.  Coldness mutes the aromas and flavors.  And tequila just isn't served chilled anyway.  What a joke.  I was polite in pointing out the issue with serving a premium tequila this way, and apparently they've received that criticism/concern in the past... yet they continue to do it anyway."
0,"The food was what you should expect when going to Denny's but the staff just wasn't that good. I've almost never had a good waitress at Denny's before. Which granted the job does suck completely, BUT, you signed up for it so don't make everyone else's experience suck because of your incompetence. If you want Denny's then you should go. But do not expect a lovely waitress to meet your needs."
1,"No cover to get in, and I get to shoot respectable liquors like Red Stag for $1 each? \n\nIs this real life?\n\nVine is probably the most inexpensive, happening place you can spend a Monday night. And it's not just for college kids--I see a mix of people hanging out to sip on drinks and watching football in the evening. Later at night, there's live music and a patio with a passable social scene. There's a good bar menu, and while there are only two bartenders--they're rather efficient. \n\nI understand not everything likes to get crazy so early in the week, but at this dive, the Tuesday morning after is worth it."
0,"We have ordered Greens and Proteins to go, many times. The food is delicious, the drinks are good *although I question the validity of the nutrition, as the other reviews mention* and it is insanely close to our house which makes it a quick and easy option. The prices are a bit high, but the quality in the food is worth it for a quick bite. \n\nThey have always messed something up on our order, but they usually fix it with little complaint *although there has been some in the past*. Today, they refused to fix it and we will not return again because of this. We ordered a pizza, burger and two drinks, as normal. They routinely miss the drinks on the order, but usually make them quickly when it is pointed out. Today was a different case; the girls had a horrible attitude, barking that the order did not include drinks. My husband explained that it did, and they finally decided to give us one, but would not give the two that we paid for. I have a call out for a manager to return my call to issue a refund to my card, but with their attitudes, I am not hopeful that I will ever actually receive this call. \n\nWe were willing to pay the price for the food, but the attitudes and poor customer service are something we can't live with. You just lost a weekly customer - bummer!"
0,"I lagged on refreshing my kicks before the Memorial Day Weekend Vegas trip, and thought I'd hit up this place on Sunday evening.  Unfortunately, surprisingly, everything was pretty much closed since it was 7:00 PM.  I know it's Sunday, but this is Vegas, mid-strip on a holiday Weekend. You would think that management would have the foresight to realize that on this sort of weekend, they could make extra money by operating on special hours and staying open a little bit later.  I was one of *many* customers showing up to find the place closed much to our chagrin.  \n\nFortunately, after doing a Yelp search on my phone, I got a good idea of the many (better and classier) places available in all of the nearby casino-resort shopping areas that were selling men's shoes and open a few hours later."
1,"The food here is really good, the service is eh.  But I am giving this 4 stars because the food really was just that good.  The bread pudding was the best I've ever had and I don't LOVE bread pudding-- but I LOVED this one.  Also, they make their own ice creams and their are delicious.  The fish I had was extremely fresh. I am no food critic, but I did grow up on the East Coast beaches of NC, so I can say with certainty the fish is fresh.  I love that they use local vendors for most of the food and the atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy and hip.  \n\nMy complaint, the service.  Flighty is a word that comes to mind.  The food took a really long time to come out and I have yet to figure out if that was the kitchen staff OR our waiter not putting our order in on time.\n\nAll that said, this is a place I will most certainly come back to."
1,"This place is great. I like the laid back atmosphere and the fact that the offer groupons and deals frequently. The food has always been good, the drinks are gigantic (which is great because I like a lot to drink with my meals), and the service is always pleasant and consistent. My only complaint is that sometimes it's way too loud and I can barely have a conversation with my boyfriend across the table. The place is family friendly so there's always a lot of kids screaming/crying/dropping things and the TVs when football is on are sometimes loud."

0,"I have to say the view is amazing! But the music(?) terrible I've been to plenty of clubs and they at least vary the music, the Voodoo Lounge DJ played about a minute and a half of a song(?) and would fade into another and the volume is set at... well like music at 11 but this place it's at about 32. Small drinks, bartenders that really don't seem interested in serving you which isn't surprising I guess for Vegas but not worth a $20 elevator ride."
1,"My wife and I had a great pre-Christmas dinner here, and it was wonderful!  Our reservations were made on-line quickly and without hassle on OpenTable, and when we had to change it, it was a few taps on the iPhone OpenTable application, and everything was all re-arranged.\n\nThe restaurant is cozy and inviting.  The host confirmed our reservation and we got a great window seat.  The restaurant is laid out as an open kitchen concept, so we also got to see the food being prepared, and it was very enjoyable  Our server Sinead was attentive and knowledgeable, which was a real plus!\n\nOn to the food: My wife ordered the Atlantic Lobster Alfredo.  She said it was the best dish she had ever had in Kitchener-Waterloo.  Period.  I had the Surf and Turf, and it was superb, and included the half of a Whole Atlantic Lobster, great taste and excellent value.  Everything was cooked to perfection and served beautifully.\n\nI could not have asked for a more perfect meal out after a hectic day of pre-Christmas preparations.  Thanks King Crab Oyster Bar and Grill for a wonderful evening."

1,"Had an awesome time here, the saxophonist was great, his dad who used to sing with ray Charles was a true performer and my friend and I were thoroughly entertained, they involved the audience. The drinks were ok, I had to send one back because it just didn't taste good. But the waitress was cool. We had fun showing customers from other cities the Frankie Beverly and Maze shuffle!"
0,"I really wanted to like this place but was very disappointed. I took my family (5 total) on a Sunday midday. We were seated upstairs (they were not that busy) and aside from the fact that our drinks were usually full that's where the good service ended. Food was not well staged, appetizers came out the same time as some entrees and then the remaining items trickled in. Asked for extra BBQ sauce for the dry sliders; we were told it was .50 and then it never came. The server came back to other parties several times before getting back to us. Everything was slow. We won't be back."
0,"Sunday brunch wasn't really all that. \n\nI've heard so much about how great this buffet is, but was a little disappointed. My tummy was craving some prime rib and crab legs. There was no prime rib (they only had dry roast beef) and the crab legs were kind of difficult to eat due to the lack of meat in them. \n\nThe selection is pretty big, more than your typical Vegas buffet, but the taste was pretty mediocre. I'd much rather have a smaller selection with high quality food. \n\nQuick tips: \n\n1. Come right before the brunch rush (around 11ish on a Sunday). There wasn't a long wait. As we left, however, the line was out the door. \n\n2. The price is good. I think we paid $17.99 for Sunday brunch. Champagne included. Not bad at all for what you get. \n\n3. If you want high quality food and a nice venue, go to the Wynn. You'll definitely be \""Wynning\"" there. LOL \n\nMeh."
0,"The service is terrible, It took at least an hour for my table to get our food after ordering it. Not to mention it is cold inside, and uncomfortable. The food was average."
0,"My girl and I went here for an early dinner yesterday.  For starters, we waited over 5 minutes before a server even came over to greet us.  No big deal.  Drinks came out quickly and soon the appetizer we ordered (chicken lolipops).  It was pretty good albeit just dressed up, snazzy chicken wings.\n\nI ordered the filet and my girl ordered something that we later found out, after waiting 10 minutes that the kitchen was out of.  So, she ended up ordering the lamb.  We both ordered our meals medium.\n\nIt took over 40 minutes to get our meals.  Pretty bad considering there was only 3 other tables filled in the restaurant.  When our food came out my filet was burnt and my girlfriend's lamb was extremely rare.\n\nI told the server of the problem with my filet and sent it back.  Didn't send back the lamb because my girlfriend had loaded up on bread during the hour and 20 minutes we had to wait to get our food and she wasn't hungry anymore.\n\nAnother 30 minutes pass and I finally get the new filet only to have it also well done.  I didnt complain, just accepted it and asked for a togo container for both meals.\n\nWe got the check and I was told the cook was new and was in training and the server apologized for the screw up on our meals.  He then said that instead of charging us for 4 glasses of wine that he only charged us a bottle.  Fantastic, I thought until I saw how much each glass cost.\n\nI dont mind paying a good bit for a quality meal however in my opinion just about everything except for the chicken wing appetizers was mediocre if not subpar.   I have had better mashed potatoes out of a box.  I ended up paying over $100 including tip.  Grossly over charged considering the experience and the quality of the food.\n\nAfter spending over 8 years as a server and front of house manager in restaurants I know what to expect and how to treat customers.  We should have never been allowed to pay for the filet and the manager should have dropped by to ask and comment on the filet.  Totally unacceptable experience we had.\n\nWe won't be returning to DW Bistro ever again."
1,"Steak and cheese is to die for. You have to be patient bc your order is going to take 20-30 mins regardless of how busy they are (or aren't). Have a beer, soda or glass of wine while you wait bc they sell it all. There is also a patio area out back. Enjoy!"
0,"I stopped in today because my sister had a BOGO coupon and insisted we go there since it's so close.\n\nFood quality is standard Quiznos, of which I have never been a fan. Sister appealed to my cheap side and lured me with a coupon.\n\nThe BOGO coupon you ask? Yeah, we couldn't use it. That was irritating. The guy gave us some song and dance about how the coupon was fake (despite the fact we had just used coupons from the same book at a McDonald's about 10 mins prior to coming here with no problems). So I don't know what that was about.\n\nHe was perfectly nice about it and gave us a free drink and chips for the trouble.  But still...\n\nDon't get the fountain soda! I got a diet Pepsi and it tasted so gross and strange I threw it out.\n\nThe store front was clean but the bathroom was nasty - poop on the toilet seat and no soap in the dispenser. EW. I get very concerned when a food establishment does not have a clean bathroom.\n\nNo reason for me to return."
1,"ATD has always gone way beyond what is normally expected to help me with my automotive repairs.  They were able to fixed the AC in my truck and get me back on the road within one day during the middle of the summer when I was traveling from Southern California to Utah and then through Phoenix.  They also do great work on the fabrication and repairs for my sandcar.  They are knowledgeable, helpful and honest.  I highly recommend ATD to anyone for automotive repairs and off-road fabrication. Thanks Craig, Shannon and the rest of the crew at ATD for the great work you do."
0,"Popular, but very loud. Not a good place if you want to have a serious conversation, but the place is friendly and active.\n\nMostly student crowd, but with some diversity. Hard to find a place to sit especially if you are more than 2 people.  Beer selection is okay, but not amazing. After all the positive hype I was disappointed by the selection where the highlight is on their custom brews."
0,"My first 1 star review ever...\n\nSo many problems with this place, where to start. The rooms are run down, the hotel is run down, it is a good long walk away from most of the strip, the type of people that stay there are obnoxious and so many other issues. Most of the problems I could live with because of the price. The problem I had was the type of people that low price attracts. I was told that it is a nice environment to stay in and it was a fun hotel, which may be true. I was shocked by how many people try to turn a trip to Vegas into a family vacation by staying here. I was appalled by the parents that walked around playing slots while smoking and holding an infant. Parents let their little children just run around the hotel unsupervised while they got plastered at the bar. \n\nI am all for going to Vegas to gamble and drink excessively. But please leave your kids home."
1,"This place has \""Family restaurant\"" written all over it.  You can tell that they care about what they serve and serve it with pride. Fresh juices, warm homemade lavash with sesame seeds, and everything is natural! This was my third trip back and I enjoyed it very much each time. I've tried their fresh carrot juice, chicken and lamb wraps and my personal favorite, Ghormeh Sabzi! I sure wish we had a place like this in Tucson. The market is great too. My wife had me pick up some saffron while I was there to bring back home!"
0,"Having gone to the Studio B, Bellagio, and Rio's buffets, I would say: Spend the extra money. The ambiance is good, but the food is so-so. Not many choices in terms of meat, especially during lunch. The fruits weren't that fresh. Not one of the better buffets on the strip (the only one I can think of that's worse is Excalibur)"
1,"Awesome. Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made. Get the Sababa Special and share it with a friend, it's big enough to split!"
0,"This is the first time I've ever walked out of a restaurant without ordering. I can understand they're busy but this is ridiculous. My family and I waited at least an hour and did the whole online \""Wait Less\"" thing. I can tell you that's a hunk of bull. When we were finally seated we waited and waited for at least someone to take our drink orders. That didn't happen and only one person came up to us saying they'll be there shortly (hint: we didn't see them again surprise surprise). I think the icing on the cake was a party who got seated AFTER my family got bread. We didn't even get that. \n\nAnyways, I'm disappointed I didn't even get to eat. We'll probably never ever visit this location again."
0,Go somewhere else. Really bad service and mediocre food. I don't understand crappy rude service. Why? We pay your bills. Really snarky counter girl really got under my skin. Ordered my food and no eye contact or a thank you.  Gave her my corporate credit card to pay and she snaps back its declined. I told her it was impossible as there's 12 thousand in there and asked her to run it again. She literally rolled her eyes at me. No really she rolled her eyes at me like I'm some deadbeat who can't pay for a 6 dollar burro. Of course it went through. No thanks or eye contact again. Come to get my food she walked away without asking me if I needed anything. Had to wait and ask for my soda cup. She pours me a solo cup of water without ice and walks away. Have to wait for her to come back and ask for my cup again. She shoots me the stink eye and says she doesn't remember charging me for a drink. Brings me a small cup when my receipt says MD Soda $1.65. Again she lays out a snarky comment saying nearly under her breath that she hadn't charged me for the soda and now I'm annoyed further from her remarks inferring I'm a scammer and looked right in her eye and said You know what. ..you did charge me. Had a carne asada burro with beans no rice. Bland food. Everything needs salt. No love in this food at all.
0,"Don't come here for pizza. I looked at reviews to find a pizza place in Casa Grande to get a slice or personal pizza and thought that this place wouldn't be bad based on reviews. I was wrong.\n\nI ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza. The pizza barely had any cheese on it in the first place, but neither the sausage nor the mushrooms were actually baked INTO the pizza. It was obvious that they had pre-made cheese slices that they warmed up on the stove top and just sprinkled the ingredients on. The crust was a decent thin crust, but the mushrooms were greasy and rubbery, the taste of the sausage was indescribable and gross (seriously, if you insist on getting pizza here, don't get the sausage)."
1,"A great example of what upgrades can do to a Stadium if rebuilding is not an option........Outstanding Party Decks all through the Outfield with various sponsors and promotions.........an small, but enjoyable outfield grass berm and an Gorgeous View of Camelback from the entire firstbase side of the field........the fact that its walking distance to 100's of bars & restaurants in Old Town is indeed a HUGE BONUS!!!........Love the place for March spring training baseball and will be back!!!"
0,"eh... the 1st time we went there the lights never went off in the theater. We had to get up and go ask them to turn them off. Also the sound went off before the movie was over. We brought it to their attention and they were very nice, apologized, and gave us a few free passes. They are new and have to work out the kinks I guess."
0,"I'm starting to feel like I only write bad reviews... I'll have to fix that.\n\nI'm not a fan.\n\nThe food was ok, but not great - and at those prices it's really not worth it.\n\nWe started with Tom Kha soup and the Roti appetizer.  The soup was okay but really under-spiced and unusually sweet for what I'm used to with this soup.  The Roti was really greasy and the dipping sauce was a kind of bland satay.\n\nI had sushi as my entree and got their version of a  fantasy roll. The roll was cut way too big so that you kind of had to break it up into pieces or shove the whole thing in your mouth in a really ugly way.  Pretty hard to taste anything either way.  The sushi was really fresh though.\n\nMy date had the spicy thai duck and he really liked it. I'm not a huge fennel fan so I didn't like it much, but it seemed like it would be good for people who are.  The tomatoes that came alongside were nowhere close to being ripe.\n\nThe place was really crowded and felt like a cafeteria. \n\nThe service was polite but about what you'd expect at a diner, they didn't know much about the menu and had wonderful Pittsburgh accents. Cute but not professional."
0,"I want to be nice and give this place two stars, but it was just terrible. This is a brand new vietnamese restaurant. For starters, you walk into this restaurant and everything seems to look okay, but then you sit down and there's overwhelming smell coming from the table, my guess is this place cleans their tables with dirty rags. The waiter then comes over with the menu and asks if we would like anything to drink, they don't have that many options for drinks......we then look at the menu and omg half if it is crossed out with a sharpie. This brand new restaurant already doesn't serve half the stuff on their menu. We decided to order egg rolls, pho, and a rice dish. We sat there as our food comes out and they never brought us serving plates, napkins, utensils or anything, how do they expect us to eat? The eggs rolls were confusing huge when they came out and on the first bite, it was like chinese style, with lots of veggies and no meat. When I go to a vietnamese restaurant, I would at least like to eat vietnamese egg rolls. Then the pho comes out (they charged $3 for 2 tiny pieces of ox tail) and visually, I thought the food was getting better, but then we had our first taste and the booth was awful, it tasted like water.....after drowning my bowl in hoisin sauce, it still had no taste. My rice dish with pork chops and egg custard didn't look too bad, but the most important part of a rice dish is the rice and it was the worst rice I have ever tasted. The pork chop were not too bad, but how am I supposed to enjoy it when the rice tasted awful. Now the egg custard, was not even made the right way. The top is supposed to have an orange color to it, and it was colorless here. Egg custard is supposed to have wonderful flavors to it, but here, it was completely bland. The workers also made the experience worst. They didn't seem to meet customers' needs. There was also one specific worker sitting at the able next to us coughing vigorously while we were eating and it sure made me lose my appetite. This place was just awful, and the only excuse they have right now, is that they are new. They have some serious changes that need to be made if they want to be successful. Workers need to put customers first and know what their needs are, the food variety needs to stop getting smaller because crossing out items does not help their business, the food quality and taste most definitely needs to improve and I'd start by learning how authentic vietnamese food should be prepared, and overall, this place needs to be improved. You guys are a new business and this is your perfect chance to improve it while it's still new. I'll be back in a few months and I hope I'll have better things to say."
1,"Lot of bad reviews here.  I guess my experiences, yup that's plural, was different.  As an Asian, I always look for the hot long noodle soup.  Vegas is heaven for that reason, and this place inside the Monte Carlo has the best soup.  You get a large bowl, but the quality is what sold me.  The broth was delicious.  The noodles were chewy goodness.  Bok Choy and Won Tons perfect.  And I always add in the Crispy Duck.  Great flavor.  I always get good service, so maybe I was lucky.  But again, I've been here multiple times and will come back multiple times."

1,Had to try it after seeing the taco challenge on the cooking channel.  The hostess was a little confused right at 11 when they opened and we were a little worried but our fears quickly subsided when our waitress and bus boy took excellent care of us.  We loved the chips and the three dips and both got super fresh salads with the taco lunch special.  My husband had the ground beef taco and I had the carnitas and it was filled with lots of delicious meat and we loved the beans and rice too.  We asked for some hotter sauce and it was hot but tasty.  We also had some delicious margaritas.  We live in CA but will definitely make the trip to Leticia's the next time we are in town.
1,"My girlfriend says it's the best hotel ever, I wouldn't go that far but it's a excellent stay.  Stayed on the eight floor In a beautiful upgraded room. The service is nice and the location is great. It's one of cleaner casinos and has a lot of shopping to do as well."
1,Must try the food!
1,"Not much to look at outside in a grim strip mall but surprisingly the inside is clean and has a nice charm. Server was very attentive and food was served hot and quick. I had the chorizo and eggs which was maybe a little salty but the spices were spot on. The beans were as good as I have had, the rice was fresh and the grilled jalapeno along with the avocado slices were the perfect garnish. I can't wait to try more of the menu as all dishes I saw looked great! Don't let the outside scare you as the inside and food is the real deal and worth the visit."
1,"The casino looks a bit tired and rundown, but I was not there for that, I was there for a prime rib dinner. They advertised the special fore prime rib at $7.77, so I was not expecting much. But dang! I am no expert on high end steak, I am Cheep. so Moderate to low price, Black Angus is my style. and I have to say, this is one of the/ if not the best Prime ribs I have ever had. plus you get a bowl of fresh bread and two sides.What more could you ask for."
0,"Monday lunch review, ordered a fajitas burrito from the lunch special menu ($7.95). \nGood chips and watery salsa served upon being seated.  I have eaten at the various incarnations of El Toro for ten years, some pretty good, some not so much, but this was my first visit to the new Neil St. store, and it is really very nice.\nService started fine, party of one, not busy, several Hispanic male servers on the floor, but I got the girl.  Burrito arrived promptly, but the beans and sour cream in the menu description were missing.  The girl thought the beans might be in the burrito, and brought SC immediately.  If beans were in burrito, they were well hidden.  Conference between girl and waiter yielded a \""side\"" of refritos on a 12 inch oval platter, easily a serving for four.  Spent rest of lunch wondering how much I would be charged for beans that were supposed to come with meal.  It was only $1.75, so no drama.  Original girl had gone missing, so not sure who I would have complained to in any event.  Ten minutes is a long time with dirty dishes and a credit card on the table to get permission to leave.    \nIncidentally, the meat in the burrito was round steak, lean, tough, dry, tasteless.  I often buy skirt steak at the Mexican grocery, and make my own carne asada.  This was beef and peppers, in a tortilla.  Not terrible, but not great either.  Back to Taco Loco for my burritos from now on."
0,"Too packed. Rude bartenders. If I'm going to pay $30 for two drinks at least be friendly. I waved my hand to get the bartenders attention and she screamed at me that she sees me and to quit waving my hand, it's pointless. I would've given it a one star, but we did have a VIP table at the end of the night and it was enjoyable then. The club tries to act like it's super high end, but I had some drunk girl at the table next to me falling everywhere and kicked my drink on my brand new dress. She should have been asked to leave. If it wasn't for my company at my table I would've left and headed back to Vanity at the Hard Rock where the place was amazingly beautiful and the staff was extremely friendly."
0,"A year ago this was my favorite buffet in Vegas.  Perhaps I had just tried a few better places since that visit, but I felt very disappointed in the offerings this year. There were no hot crab legs, most of the mussels were closed and inedible, and the macarons were dry and stale tasting. I couldn't find much that I wanted to eat- even the cheese selection was lacking. I sipped on some onion soup and ate a cold baguette and left disappointed. Hopefully it was just an off night, but I won't be back to find out."
1,"I went to Salt last night with a friend and it's like you're not even in Pittsburgh! The place definitely reminds me of restaurants in bigger metropolitan areas. We actually initially passed it up when driving b/c there's not much around it in terms of other restaurants. I think I remember seeing a beer distributor across the street. \n\nSo on to the review - the hostess and wait staff were extremely pleasant and attentive. We asked to be seated at a community table and looked over the menu. Although the menu isn't extensive, it offers a variety of flavors. I chose the short ribs which are boneless. They were really good, they had more fat on them than I'm comfortable with, but I tend not to eat a lot of meat so I'm really really picky. The sauce on it was great and the brussel sprouts and mushrooms were cooked to perfection. They also had this sweet potato puree - LOVED IT - but I'm a big sweet potato fan. \n\nFor a drink I ordered the \""Rum\"" cocktail which was amazing. It wasn't overly sweet or bitter - I couldn't even taste the alcohol but I could feel it - dangerous! It was one of the best drinks I've ever had...we even went to Embury afterwards and I thought Salt's drinks were so much better than Embury's. \n\nAll in all a great experience, I docked them one star b/c of the fatty meat - but hey maybe they were meant to be like that! They were very tender and flavorful."
1,"The folks at Bungalow know fashion. We ventured there today for the first time. What a relief! A furniture store that doesn't exude the vibe of Ashley's or The Room Store. Or Robb Stuckey :) Those stores have their place, but if you're looking for something unique, in a certain design/color, you'll walk out of here with something... guaranteed. The pricing is medium/high, but it's what you'd expect from an ecletic group of hard goods, sprawled throughout the store that would make anyone with ADD joyous. Coming back here is on the top of my list. Gotta make a big payment to AMEX though!"
1,Ate here about three times now. Its not the best but coming from New Orleans it stops the cravings for crawfish a little bit. Oysters are pretty good/fresh.  Cajun fries are really good. If you had real poboy and want poboys don't get it from here... Go to New Orleans. Or Mississippi.
0,"I understand that this place is an old classic, but it seems more old than classic at this point.  It just feels dirty inside, the food is medium quality at very best and the service struggles.  They try hard, but it looks like the staff is on their own.  Probably my last visit unless there is a serious change."
1,"Love this place.  A great place for breakfast but the cakes are amazing, and real buttercream if you choose buttercream.  Growing up in the Midwest and having a grandfather as a dairyman my grandmother threw a stick of butter in everything.  She lived until she was 83.  So much for they theory it's bad for you.  I can taste the real deal on first bite.  Not margarine, not shortening but butta real butta.....the melt in your moth savor every bite kind.  Great for birthday cakes, wedding cakes, corporate events,  any given Tuesday...let me see yes any reason to have cake.  Like I say in my description more of a sweetie than a foodie.  I just found out that they rent the restaurant for private events.  She has the entire restaurant for YOUR private event.\nI would say 30 - 50 people?"
0,"We have been going to this buffet off and on for years and the quality is definitely headed downhill. We took the kids yesterday and we disliked almost everything and we are not picky. \n\nThe fruit was fine, of course that would be awfully hard to mess up, but the mashed potatoes, grits, pot stickers, rice, and several other little things were pretty bad and left on the plates. My husband did like the pulled pork, and my daughter liked the pork buns....guess it was a good pork day? My favorite thing was the sourdough bread and butter, if that tells you anything. The kids said the ice cream was good, but my pumpkin pie was gross and artificial tasting.\n\nWe have noticed that the quality is better on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. Not sure if that is because there is more turnover or you cannot use your 2 for 1 coupons those days. This buffet is possibly worth it, if you have the 2 for 1 (8.99 for 2 lunches) otherwise, this would be near the bottom of my list of places to eat."
1,"Fast ,Efficient Friendly. I Fly Southwest to Las Vegas and they are the only way to go. On line check in Rocks. No Delays .Doesn't get any Better."
0,"Absurdly overpriced, however, I was shocked by the rock bottom quality. I thought I could trust yelp with 4 stars, which, in my home town, is reserved for only top spots. We bought three few pastries, a milk shake (they put ice in it for god sakes), an espresso, and one cappuccino. My french father-in-law was with us and he summed it up by saying, \""there is nothing french about any of this.\"" The espresso machine is one of those automatic numbers and the baristas have trouble using a steam wand, I had them redo my drink twice and asked for my money back. Looks are deceiving---typical Vegas. I was there in the morning, could they be any more inefficient?\n\nPoor espresso drinks, poor quality. Looks delicious. Pure hype. Avoid."
0,"First time here this past sunday 12-17-13 was looking for a nice place to watch the niners game. Me and my buddy eric came down sat at the back bar, service started out good but buy the 4th quarter of the game couldn't get a beer to save my life. Will say food is good when it does come. Not sure if ill be back...."
0,I did not enjoy the lunch buffet. There wasn't as much variety as I've seen at other Las Vegas buffets and the quality was poor.
0,"On the plus side: the coffee was very good and they tried to seat us away from air conditioning vents. The place was freezing. \n\nEverything else: not so much.  One order of biscuits and gravy. Gravy was not  hot and had nothing in it but way way too much salt. \""Biscuits\"" were more like dumplings in that they were not cooked thru so that they were doughy.\n\nI ordered the fall special: pumpkin pancakes. They came with a huge dollop of whipped cream and something yellowish that was way too sweet. Glad I only ate one. Within the hour, I was rushing for the \""facilities\"".  Hmmm. Guess we won't be going back."
0,"I really wanted to check this place out but like a lot of things it didn't live up to the hype.   The club that it's attached to, Moon, is normally, too crowded and seemed like an afterthought rather than a vision.   I don't like it here; however, the view of the strip from the outdoor patio is fantastic. \n\nAdvice:\n  Here's a tip if you're getting there late; especially on off nights.\nThere will be a point when you'll pay to get into the Playboy Club/Moon and you can get into the Ghost Bar for free and visa versa.  ie.  Sunday night at 1:30 am you pay 30 bucks to get into the Playboy Club/Moon and show your stamped wrist and they'll let you into the Ghost Bar for free.  Well, if you go to the Ghost Bar, same thing, you'll be able to get into the Playboy Club/Moon for free...only you'll pay 20 bucks to get into the Ghost Bar."
0,"This restaurant is okay. The food is good, but not fabulous. And it's very expensive for only a so-so dining experience. I went there once, that was enough."
1,"I've been looking for a good Groomer for the past two years and I honestly, think I've finally found her!  \n\nI've driven past this place for the past few months and finally decided to take my dog here. Once again, I absolutely hate getting him groomed (he hates it more) for so many reasons. Groomers never listen to what I want, it's too expensive, they keep dogs for way too long, etc. Seriously, if I make an appointment for 12 and I don't get a call 'til 4, there's something wrong.  \n\nBut I digress.  None of this was the case with Classic Canine III (where are the first two?).  I made an appointment for 4 and expressed my deep concern for the how I hate groomers that take forever.  She assured me this wasn't the case with her.  I dropped Ollie off at 4:10 and got a call that he was finished at 5:30.  Does it get any better?  What?  $40?  Heck yeah!  \n\nNot only was it inexpensive and very convenient but it was 100% the best groom job my dog has ever had.  Everyone thinks they know how a Cavalier should be groomed but this is Vegas and it's HOT.  I like him short.  She did exactly what I wanted.  I hope she gets a lot of business because she deserves it!\n\nI really want to give this place 5 stars but I have to say,I really think they need to have a website because it took a couple of attempts to get a hold of the groomer.  Stuff like that is kind of important and it almost made me go somewhere else."
1,Very happy with my experience here! The girls up front where very helpful finding the right bowl for us and made sure we knew everything that it contained before it was made. Used to go to Juice N Go often but I think this might have to be my new spot!
0,"Worst service I have ever experienced in my life.  Our server, not sure of his name because he literally didn't say more than 5 words to us the whole time we ate there, was HORRIBLE.  He had black rimmed glasses with black hair and a beard. If you dine here beware of him! Ask for Megan, she was fantastic! The only server that smiled, literally. She refilled our drinks, brought out our food and cleared our food. Not even sure where our server was. The restaurant is super tiny yet he was no where to be found.  I'm also a server at a restaurant on the strip and I almost lost my cool with this guy.  He didn't even drop our check, another random server did.  Just a really miserable person who should not be waiting tables for a living. It's unfortunate too because the food is good. When you have someone treat you like you don't exist and acts like he could give a shit it ruins the whole experience.  Will most definitely not be returning."
1,"Almost don't want the secret to get out, but it's inevitable! This place is a \""must do\"" for Vegas. Forget buffets downtown, it's all about steak houses! Beautiful ambiance, transports you to another realm. Lovely service and the food, of course, is delicious. I won't give you too much detail, the pleasures of Andiamo should be discovered as you dine, but rest assured you will enjoy this culinary sanctuary."
0,"I have been going here for over 10 years. The main reason for  bad rating is their total lack of communication with my physician. I am also writing this after the third year of such lack of communication.\n\nOften my doctor will tell me that they did not get results. I will then call and ask for the results to be sent and they may or may not get sent. They also do not use modern methods of communications (sorry, faxes are so last century). There is no reason for me to wait 2 or 3 weeks for my results--if at all. The communication problems have been especially problematic when I have had to come back for further testing. The front desk has a disconnect as well--i I call and ask a question, I rarely get a follow-up call. They'll say something like \""I'll research this\"" and never get back.\n\nNow as far as the care itself---in general I have had a good experience with the mammograms themselves. I have also had breast ultrasounds and they have been done by Dr. Nocera herself and she is very thorough and reassuring.\n\nI may go back one more year but if it does not change in the communications area, I will be switching."
1,"All of their food is EXCELLENT but when it comes to gyro sandwiches, which is why I go to a Greek restaurant, they are HUGE with plenty of tomato, onion, and tzatziki  sauce. I like several around town but for the money I haven't found more bang for my buck as when I went to this place. It is a regular bi weekly stop for me."
0,"Ok to good food but not for the price. I'm not going to ratectge tequillas bc if a restaurant has over 50 of one kind then anyone should be able to fond at least one they like. Overall not impressed by the hype and felt more ripped off by the food. Over cooked flank steak, and the waiter even tried telling me that's how it's suppossed to be. Spoke to the manager and he refunded that entr\u00e9e. Very disappointing. I could have just drove to Henderson or the strip for something this pricey and over hyphed"
0,"To keep it short:\nWe didn't ask for check, still eating but the waitress brought us the check, she was rude because when we complain that why we have to wait 15 minutes to order she said there is nothing she can do.\n\n\nFood was good\nDessert was good\n\nFor such a low service the prices are too high."
1,"Battista's is awesome.  You can find higher quality Italian food out there, but the food is still better than most, especially better than your generic crap like Buca di Beppo.  \n\nBattista's is all about its convenient location to the Strip and all the stuff you get with your meal.\n\nYour entree comes with a soup or salad, cappucino, garlic bread and UNLIMITED wine!  The cappucino is delicious in my opinion, a great way to end the meal.  \n\nI've had the spaghetti and meatballs, chicken parm and ziti w meat sauce.  I will recommend that you stick with the meatballs / meat sauce.  The chicken parm is not worth the extra 5 bucks or whatever.  It is good but not high tier for chicken parms.  The meat sauce is definitely above average, along with the meatballs.\n\nSome people here say it is too expensive.  Sure, I can go down to South Las Vegas and get unlimited wine and beer from Studio B at the M Resort, but Battista's gets you filled up and full of wine 1 minute from the strip.  It is right behind the Flamingo.  \n\nI milk it a bit, take a while to order while I enjoy the wine.  I get my money's worth.\n\nAccordion player comes around to serenade you and your hot date.  \n\nOverall, I agree with the majority of posts here, the food is good, not the best, but solid.  You get a bang for your buck.  My advice is to stick to the cheaper options for a value play on Vegas."
0,"Ordered a Monterey burrito (carne asada, cheese and beans) husband ordered a big burrito (chile relleno, beans, rice cheese, guacamole, pico, and carne asada) we got both wet style. The enchilada sauce on top was disgusting! Super salty and gelatinous. Gross. How hard is it to make some real enchilada sauce or at least buy a good Cannes version. Carne asada was a grey color. No char marks or signs of quality grilling. Looked boiled. We both said our burritos smelled fishy and left with our hands smelling fishy. How was that possible with carne asada? Not going back. Should have listened to the other reviewer!"
1,"This place needs more credit than what it's been given. They have amazing sides and plenty to choose from, the meat was tender, juicy and full of flavor, and service was great. Not to mention the sauce is in a heated dispenser- win! The man working behind the counter who helped us said he was from Georgia... Georgia people! He's gotta know what he's doing lol Rudy's and their paper-lined baskets and weird sides... meh! Come here for a real BBQ meal."
0,"Usually Mexican food served out of an outdated building with numerous building code violations is always the best. Not so much in the case of Carolina's. I arrived on a Saturday about 11 am to a short line and I had heard from one longtime Phoenix resident that this is the real deal. I had to try the famous tortillas right? So, I ordered up a cheese quesadilla and a red machaca burrito. How does it end up that Arizona and Nevada have completly different ideas of what machaca is. It is supposed to be dry beef grilled with onions, peppers, tomatoes and eggs. But in Phoenix, it is basically shredded wet beef doused in red or green sauce. Regardless, the Carolina's version was miserable. It was mushy and tasteless and since the thin tortillas could not hold all that beef inside, it turned into a knife and fork thing. I barely ate three bites of the mess and some fat was also discovered lurking in that meat.  Not good.\nSame thing with the quesadilla. Due to the tortilla being so thin, the cheese overwhelmed the item turning it into a cheese wafer. If I want Machaca, I'm heading back to Nevada next time to a state that knows the true definition of the dish."
1,"My experience with the shop started out rocky but they recovered wonderfully. I brought my car in after it wouldn't start and Mike had promised to diagnose my car within an hour. I didn't hear from them for about a day and a half so I gave them a call. I was told they had some issues with staff, which is understandable.. It happens. Luckily Javier took my car into his own hands after the staff issues were resolved. It was diagnosed and my starter was repaired in a couple of hours. He sent his mechanic to pick me up and when I arrived he sincerely apologized for my wait and gave me a wonderful deal. Before I headed out of the shop I mentioned to him that my rotors and brakes needed to be replaced as well. He immediately got on the phone to order the parts and threw his mechanics on my car with an hour left until close. I was out of the door in 30 minutes with again another wonderful deal! Javier's customer service was impeccable and I will continue to service my car through tire works."
1,"I am an LA girl and I was only in town for a few days when I realized that I really needed a waxing. I looked on Yelp and saw all the great reviews about this place and Lindsay.. I made an appointment on a Thursday afternoon for that evening, but then realized that I wouldn't be able to make it because of a delay I had at the airport. Lindsey was very understanding and scheduled me for the next day before I was leaving town. All I can say is that I wish she had a salon in LA! She was very personable and she did a great job with the waxing. Added bonus - it was all at a very reasonable price! I would definitely recommend Lindsay for all your waxing needs."
0,"Horrible and rude staff, we checked it and paid for a table and they never gave us a table, tried to get out money back and they refused, therefore we called the credit card company and canceled the transaction. I am a local and have brought many many out of town friends to this establishment. I will never come or bring anyone here ever again, not a good buisness  strategy , you can't promise someone what they paid for and then say we are full sorry and keep your money. Avoid this club at all cost, I'm ashamed to have given them so much buisness."
0,"Pros:\n1. Ice cold Newcastle at the bar\n2. Scotch Egg was very tasty\n3. Fries were super salty and hot\n4. Friendly bartender with a heavy hand on the alcohol :)\n5. Meat pie sampler was top notch per my gal\n\n\nCons:\n1. Dusty front of the restaurant (the black steel window frames) right next to diners eating at the \""patio\""\n2. Had a rare burger but the meat had zero seasoning and the bun was meh...wilted lettuce leaf, bland experience\n3. Prices were through the roof (we spent the same for lunch here as we did for  dinner at Gordon Ramsay's Paris restaurant)\n4. Seating was designed with high back chairs that were way too low for the table - felt like we were eating at the kid's table\n5. Manager type guys in suits that looked like they were in the Mafia - never smiled or spoke to the diners."
0,"I traveled from NYC to Las Vegas where most of the famous chefs have opened restaurant there, and having experience extraordinary experiences in NYC dining scene including Daniel Boulud Restaurants; I was expecting the same in Vegas... Daniel Boulud Brasserie was a disappointment; and I wish I didn't have to say this because I'm a big fan of Boulud's cuisine.  However, this place was meant for people who don't have much dining experiences, perhaps first-timer fine diners who can't compare others experiences....\nAt time of reservation we were told twice that Jacket was required, we arrived there, and were the only ones wearing jacket; everybody else were wearing casual clothing, jeans, t-shirts, etc...  When you dine at Daniel in NYC they are jacket required and if you are not wearing one, you are not allow to the main dining room... that's the way it should be, but don't ask for a jacket when people are are dressed so casual.   Bread took forever to arrive at the table, the wine took another 30 minutes, we had to ask to move table because they sat us in a corner next to the waiter station, and to worse part was that the food was not memorable, I was disappointed and knowing daniel I know that is not his styles.  Hope they are getting this reviews and actually do something about it; otherwise is just another restaurant in Las Vegas."
0,"We came here awhile back for lunch. We came here b/c at the time It said that we would get a % off If we mentioned we saw this on Yelp. This is the specific reason we went there and had even heard of it. \n\nI ordered the Puttanesca and my bf ordered a baked cheese something or another. His tasted great, mine was very bland. I wouldnt reorder this again. The breadsticks in the bag were good and garlicky but I cant eat them so it was more torture to just get a small nibble . . to know its good and not be able to eat it.. :(\n\nWell here's where the deduction for the add'l 2 starts comes from:\nWe asked for the check and mentioned we saw this on Yelp. He said he didnt know anything about it. Normally I'd just let this go but it was the way he spoke to us very condescending and I felt a little disrespected. I asked him if he had a manager (which I NEVER EVER do) he left and came back and said oh he's out for a little bit, I said ok, well can you call him? \nyes... that was little ole me asking for the manager to be phoned. I said I didnt think it was right to advertise buy one get one 1/2 off  if you mention you saw it on Yelp and then take it back once you get people in. that's false advertising... \n\nHe came back and said he called the manager, and that he agreed to take off the discount which was probably no more than $6 or $7 at most. All that for $6.00, really? you're willing to risk losing a customers over that? well they must not be hurting if they can risk being rude. . \n\nWould I come back? maybe, ok, let's be honest probably not likely considering there are sooo many places in LV and Henderson where I can spend my $. \n\nThey do have a nice view in the afternoon/night if you sit by the window. HOwever, I've also heard you get that same great view if you goto Lindo Michoacan. . ."
0,"Old Navy used to have quality merchandise.  No longer.  For example, if you are looking for all cotton Tiny Tees which used to be an Old Navy staple and which we purchased dozens of in the past, you will find that they no longer carry them.  They've replaced them with a poor quality synthetic that is so thin you're liable to be arrested for wearing them.  (Even in Las Vegas.  :)  The race to the bottom in terms of quality is sad.  \n\nThis particular store is very depressing.  It always looks like war-torn Bosnia with items thrown here and there.  It is almost impossible to find your size.  We shopped on a Wednesday and might as well have been at a flea market.  The ambiance is post-garage sale.  We left without buying anything and swore never to go back."
0,"I'm going to start by saying I really miss Yee's Laundry on Park street and that I've tried to fall in Love with Block Cleaners. I really want to support them... I'm a local guy - but they have lost my order twice, which required having to go back or stand around waiting while they look for my clothing and tell me how hard it's going to be to find. \n\nThey are tough on buttons and if they break a button and bother to fix it at all, it's likely the button won't even be a serviceable match.\n\nWhile they advertise same day service - I've never found this to be the case. I'd like to find another small dry cleaner and laundry that has an attention to detail. I'm open to suggestions"
1,"I had a shrimp po' boy when I came here and it was delicious! The shrimp was crisp and the bread was fresh.\n\nThe only problem was the wait. I had to wait over 20 minutes for a po' boy and a sandwich. Maybe it was because I went on a Friday or maybe it could be contributed to the time went into making it. None the less, waiting for food that long on a to-go order wasn't what I expected.\n\nThe owner was very friendly and even offered samples to those who did not know what gumbo.\n\nIf you're looking for a fancy Cajun restaurant this is not it. The decor was nothing to brag about. But if you want to impress your family and friends by taking them to a place with good down home cooking then definitely stop by and give them a try!"
1,"We have enjoyed coming to this location for years now.  As mentioned in other reviews, the owner, Lee, is exceptional and makes sure his establishment provides exceptional service.  Today , one of my dogs, Timmy, turned 7 and we thought it would be fun to take him and his buddy, Eddy, along for dinner.  A restaurant I'd been told was welcoming to dogs had closed recently.  On a whim, I called the 5 & Diner to ask if dogs were allowed in the patio area.  The woman who answered the phone, Ruth, enthusiastically answered that dogs were not just allowed, they were welcomed!   The waitress brought out to go containers and a pitcher of water for the dogs, served us our dinners, then brought out a birthday dessert for the dogs, complete with a candle and a wonderful rendition of the Happy Birthday song!!  We'll certainly be back on the other dog's birthday for another party!!"
0,"Delivery  said 45 minutes came in 1 hr 1/2 . The pizza was disgusting . So much grease , after blotting one slice with a paper towel I went on to use a second , and third ... Soaked completely through . My hands were covered in grease . I can't believe people actually say this is good pizza! Gross! I was starving and couldn't even bring myself to finish a single piece. Will never order from this place again"
1,I have only been here one time but I am a fan and it was enough to get me to write a yelp review.  I had the chicken taco's and they were excellent.  I ordered three of them and had planned to eat two and bring the other home with me.  I didn't bring the other one home with me because I ate it.  The woman at the counter was very informative and friendly and the food was great.  I prices were the same as any other taco shop in the Phoenix area and the product was superb.
1,"The scallops appetizer are AMAZING, actually everything was amazing. The food and service were great, no complaints. The atmosphere was very nice as well. It is a great date spot to take that special someone. I recommend trying this place if you have not already!"
1,"Two words Henderson Special. It has wings, pizza and salad for a very reasonable price. The wings are crisp and juicy, the sauce perfectly seasoned. The pizza is greasy and flimsy. The salad crisp and fresh. This is my favorite place for date night. I wish they delivered, but every time I call the driver isn't working :-( Service is slow, but who cares, give me my wings and leave me alone. It's as close to perfection as any sports bar will ever get in my life."
1,"It doesn't get better than this. A helpful, spiritual God loving minister named Melinda helped us through the process. Made us feel very comfortable and gave some fantastic insight to both the blessings and challenges of marriage.\n\nBut it wasn't just this minister that made this day and occasion special. The place has the full compliment of clothes shoes and accessories... I even think I saw some rings in the drawer.. Talk about full service!\n\nAnyway, the chapel area is fun and has plenty of space for a dozen or more people. Nicely decorated and as I said before, comfortable...\n\nShe took some great pictures too.\n\n The flyer we saw at the office where we got the marriage license just stood out! Big red letters. FIFTY bucks, full service with pictures... Couldn't believe it. Sure beat the justice of the peace special we were considering.\n\nIn conclusion, I have to state that if your going to Vegas and do the deed, check this place out. Whether its the cute little chapel, the full service speciality,or people who care about you, and your special day, the Vegas Simple Wedding Chapel is the right choice at the right price."
1,"Wow was extremely surprised at how good this place was.  It is a little hard to find its behind the plaza with Lee's Sandwiches and Pho Kim Long.  It has about 15 tables and is well suited for groups as some of the tables have a dish carousel in the middle. \n\nThe food is some the best Chinese food I have had in the US, even the tea was good. This is as authentic as you'll find.   The service was extremely good and our food came out quickly.  I highly recommend the Mapo Tofu, Lamb with Cumin and house special fried rice.  \n\nThis place is a must try."
0,"You know, I don't give a lot of single star ratings. Honestly this is the first time i've wished I could give a no star rating. I've lived in CA for years, and made many many many many trips to Vegas as it's not far away. I've stayed in hotel all up and down the strip, state line and even off strip. \n\nTHIS HOTEL is the WORST I have ran into.\n\nSeriously... what gives? Some of the now gone hotels from just past stateline... that no one really stopped in were nicer than the Riviera. \n\nI'm guessing that this mighty giant has finally just gotten old and needs to be torn down. I mean, their main attraction is an act I remember from the 80s. They let the room Frank Sanatra sang in rot with nothing happening in it. The hotel itself isn't very clean, and over all it's just a really sad experience. \n\nI stayed here for over a week for a convention I was attending at the Riviera. I have to say I was not impressed with their convention space either. It was limited, and wasn't a huge fan. \n\nThe only redeeming quality surprisingly enough, was the Buffet on site. It actually was pretty decent."
1,"Absolutely wonderful!! Fantastic attentive staff! Beautiful decor, impeccably clean, and romantic. Six warn delicious bread choices in the basket brought to the table. The olive bread was amazing!! Caprese salad with the most incredible buffalo mozzarella started us off. Followed by our main course Salmon with chick pea paste and Grouper with wine and capers. Both expertly prepared and off the chart delicious!! The pasta Bolognese was also a big hit!! Tartufo and Afogato, our dessert choices, were the perfect end to a beautifully presented, absolutely delicious Sunday evening meal! This is our first, but certainly not last time to Montreal, and we will most definitely return to BIS!!!"
0,Ordered 2 different dishes and got the same exact thing. Couldn't tell which of the 2 considering it was comparable to a sweet and sour sauce neither of which I ordered. Fried rice? Nope. Panda express is better and that is saying a lot.
0,"I don't know why everybody likes the Wynn?! We got a room with 2 DOUBLE BEDS on the 40th something floor?!! Everywhere else in Vegas have QUEEN BEDS, and I could not believe my eyes that they actually put 2 doubles in such an upscale fancy place like the Wynn. I mean everything else was great, like the view of the golf course, the room service... but double beds, come on Wynn. Even Flamingo, TI, Harrahs have queen beds! Also the carpet was really dirty, I think it's suppose to be light yellow, ours was yellow and black. AND we had hotel neighbors, a bunch of douchbags guys, saying we were \""too loud\"" at 9PM on a Friday night?! Who does that?! It's VEGAS, we came here to party, not sleep at 9PM. Walls are paper thin, we heard our neighbors as they heard us. \n\nSomeone should ask Mr. Wynn why he decided to be shady on the beds and walls when it's such a luxurious hotel. I'm disappointed, I would not book at the Wynn again. \n\nThe hotel was nice, but rooms itself were not worth it."
0,I went to this place cus we where new to the west side and liked to do karaoke and this bar was close by. 1.) The bartender was sick with the flu and still working?? 2.) this combo bar thing is weird and attracts different style crowds that don't necessarily mix 3.) the way you request a song was different and confusing and the host didn't follow the list anyway. In my book that's 3 strikes your out!! and the search goes on for a good karaoke bar.:(
0,"Let me preface with by saying, Emily Stooks (Horning) is an incredible teacher and I thoroughly enjoyed her class and positive energy. She deserves 5 stars.\nI had high hopes for Urban Yoga, which was close to the friend's house I was staying with for the holiday. I went for the new student special since I was in town for 10 days. I made it to 5 classes. Overall the instructors were pretty warm and welcoming. The reason for the 1 out of 5 stars is because of the awful business practices that do not align with the philosophy they teach.\nWhen I purchased the new student special, I told the sales associate I was visiting from Portland and was not able to bring my mat. Most studios I've encountered during my many years of a regular practice do not charge for mat use but Urban Yoga does. I requested an exception be made since I was traveling (and they were very cheap, low-end mats that were being rented at $2/class). The sales associate told me flat out no. I asked her to talk to a manager or someone to see if she could get permission. She suggested I go purchase a cheap mat locally. I was taken back and asked her opinion about what I should do with this mat when I leave again. Her response was to give it away or throw it away. After my initial shock, I asked one last time if she could ask if a manager would make an exception which she agreed to look into. After class I again was told no. At that point I wished I hadn't purchased the new student package. I ended up finding a friend of a friend that let me borrow a mat for the week. What a terrible experience.\nWith one exception, during every class the studio was very chilly making it difficult to initially warm up the body properly.\nAdditionally every single class I went to at that studio let out no sooner than 5 minutes late and sometimes up to 15 minutes late. Although I was on vacation, this is incredibly inconsiderate of people's time and schedules.\nI find it quite curious that Urban Yoga pretty consistently gets poor reviews from out-of-towners visiting Phoenix. I will not be returning to this studio over my Christmas break in Phoenix."
0,"Sorry, hate to give a less than stellar review to something that purports to donate the proceeds to charity, (and I will be charitable myself here and assume that all or almost all of the funds do indeed go straight to the cause), but this just isn't that great.\n\nOf course, I am such a slimeball that I didn't even pay full price- got a discount coupon from dinelv.com and loaded up the car with my daughter, niece, and a 7 and a 3 year-old. \n\nNow, when this \""event\"" was held at Sunset Park, it was half the price, so I figured there would be twice as many displays. In fact, there were more, but they were repeats of the same amateurish, uninspired, two-dimensional, and yes, cheap looking set-ups from past (disappointing) years. There is an additional light tunnel, which the kids particularly enjoyed, but most of the ride consisted of  a monotonous trail of widely spaced cheesy displays showcased on bare asphalt ground with concrete walls and lots of chain link fencing as a background. Ho ho ho hum.  \n\nThe journey quickly deteriorated as we gave up attempting to explain to the kiddies what earthly connection that sharks, dinosaurs, and McDonald's golden arches had  with Christmas, and just began to entertain one another with increasingly sarcastic comments about the questionable d\u00e9cor. Highlight was when we came up slowly over a rise and I had the little ones convinced we were in imminent danger of hurtling over the edge of the earth. At least they were paying attention for a minute, anyway.\n\nLowlight? Actually, it was kind of my fave- an unexpected little surprise at the end. Just when you are getting REALLY irritated because they are directing you away from what is obviously the nearest exit to this yawnfest and forcing you to loop through the whole parking lot to escape, you find there is a method to this madness: the living nativity scene!! Yes, they actually found a bunch of volunteers willing to dress up like Mary, Joseph, and the whole crazy gang, and mill around a makeshift stable! My jaw dropped. Best part- my evil niece gasped, \""OMG! Roll down the window - they're singing!!\"" So we did. And in an uncharacteristic display of restraint and Christmas spirit, I rolled it back up again before they could hear our commentary.\n\nIn summary: this is OK for young children and very tolerant adults, but tired, cheesy and overpriced. Not to mention the speedway isn't close to anybody. Go to the cactus garden at Ethel M. instead. It's beautiful AND free."
1,Max front end supervisor is the biggest reason I go to this Costco. Has that place on.lock down. Handles whatever is thrown at him. Will make a great manager one day
1,"Michael Jackson One is possibly the best CdS show in Vegas right now - if you're like me, grew up with his music, the mere idea of endless medley of MJ music combined with top-notch performing arts is irresistible enough... It's even more than that when it goes beyond my imagination.\n\nThat was Michael Jackson One.\n\nI don't want to spoil with details but one thing I want to tell... some moments brought tears to my eyes. It's that good!"
1,Awesome gyros!
1,"This hotel was a lot of fun. I love the focus on celebrity chefs. Food was great,,,,, don't eat at the buffet though."
0,The waitress are not hot at all...and honestly i think they can think of better outfit than orange boyshorts and skin color stockings. \nFood is just like other sports bars. Not a fan of the wings
1,Our favorite restaurant in Madison! Love the cheese curds especially! A great spot for excellent food at an incredible value. And LOTS of beer choices. A Wisconsinite's dream!
0,"Went in, middle of the afternoon. Only two tables are seated.  A cook from the back came out, saw us and went back to the kitchen. We waited to be seated for 10+ minutes and eventually left and went to Riverview IHOP. \n\nThe next day, we tried the IHOP on Apache again. It was morning and packed. Waited again for a while, no one came to seat us. Back to Riverview.\nWon't be returning."
0,"Piss poor... spent 200.00 on an office chair along with a coffee table for another 230.00. Sales person stated both are in-stock in the RC Willey clearance center. He then went to advise me that it was *10 minutes* away. From the Henderson location to North Vegas?! more like 30-40 minutes. \n\nArrive at the RC Willey clearance center to get notified at that time that all they have for me is the coffee table, the chair's still in Utah. Great... so I call them advise that I spent all this time driving to pick up one item when I was advised two items in-stock. \n\nI admit, they did try to fix the problem and offered to ship to me, which I was grateful for.  However, I don't think I should wait over a week from when I originally went to will call the item(s). \n\nSo, week goes by and the driver calls to advised that they'll be delivering within an hour. At this time I was finally happy that the product was being delivered. \n\nThink I was happy? Wrong! The chair came pre-assembled, which I did not mind IF it was done properly. The screws that mount to the arm rests were either stripped or not even screwed on all the way. the bottom base of the seat that mounts to the lower end of the chair was CARELESSLY done. The whole assembly looks like they did not give a **** and just used a power tool WITHOUT EVEN ALIGNING THE SCREWS FIRST! So there's several stripped screws due to carelessness and several that were not even screwed down PERIOD. This company really cares about their customers'. NOT.\n\nSo, I called complained. NOW, I have to wait another 4 days (the chair is in stock here in Nevada) to get a replacement. Any compensation? NOPE!\n\nWill definitely NOT buy from here again. Going to try Walker as I hear better reviews from friends/family."
1,"I was desperate to hide from the sweltering Phoenix heat, looking for somewhere to eat at 8 pm on a Tuesday evening. In a normal downtown area that would be an easy task but of course, NOT in Phoenix! T hen I came across Hanny's. An old deptartment store that has been transformed into a hip and modern eatery with fantastic food. The beat salad was amazing! Really impressed with Hanny's."
1,"I have been doing business with Mcghies for over ten years. I purchased my first road bike over 10 years ago from them. Recently I put an order in for a new road bike and was told the bike would be in a month. I received a call from Sean the manager that there was a problem with shipment of the bike I ordered and I would not be getting \""that\"" bike. Sean said \""I pitched a fit to the bike rep of the company.\""  He said the rep would give me an upgraded bike for their error and asked me if that would be ok. We are talking upgrading from a  $2200.00 road bike to a bike that retails for over $4000. I was ecstatic to say the least. Talk about customer service! In the past I have returned two bike pumps that were leaking and they were replaced with new ones on the spot, no hassles. The service department has always done a great job maintaining and servicing my bikes. The staff at Mcghies is helpful and knowledgeable. Thanks to Sean for going the extra mile!"
1,"I saw the Dunkin thread and felt I had to do a review for my favorite donut place.\n\nI was introduced to Bosa by my church.  They have a Cafe between services and when they made the switch to Bosa, I noticed a big difference in quality and taste from the previous supplier.  The texture and creaminess of a simple glazed is similar to a Krispy Kreme.  The fritters are excellent and I like their bagels.\n\nIf I am going to pick up donuts to bring into work, I make a stop at Bosa.  To me, Dunkin is not as good as Bosa.  \n\nBosa is unique to Chandler and we are lucky to have them."
0,"I decided to use Park n' go because the airport lot could not guarantee parking. My car was covered in bird crap and muddy because the lot is not paved. Also, I had to wait in line when I went to leave because the person in front of me had some problems. I gave them a second chance and when I came back to my car it was damaged because someone hit it. The company would not do anything and told me to call the police. I will not park there ever again."
0,"While the facility was relatively clean, I was quickly reminded why it's been 15 years since I last put this food in my mouth. The burger was disgusting on a level equal to what I imagine purina dog food would taste like. They need to change the name to Crap In The Box."
0,Our group of four just had very slow service in a  nearly empty bar and they were stymied by one guest ordering a sazerac. The ambience is a basic lobby bar. \n\nNothing special and I hope we caught them at a bad moment.
1,"Great food,  great service. I really enjoy the look and feel of this establishment."
0,"What a DUMP! If you think this place is good you either (a) have had very little life experience outside of Maricopa County or (b) have little or no taste. How can a restaurant mess up Irish pub food? Answer: Tilted Kilt found a way. OFTEN.  It's bad enough this place is filled with servers who look like cheap Arizona hookers walking the Van Buren stroll (nice and respectful of women, I might add). But even worse - SOME GIRLS DON'T BELONG IN SKIMPY OUTFITS LIKE THAT! Management needs to get some glasses and a new menu.  Disgusting on every level."
0,"This is the worst Vegas hotel I've ever stayed at! The room smelled like mildew, the bathroom was filthy, and there were cobwebs in the corner of the room! The toilet had brown stains and the beds were two full sized ones with lumpy mattresses. On top of that, the staff was incredibly rude and had a lot of attitude, particularly the accounting/billing department! I will never be staying here again! Avoid at all costs!"
0,Have gone twice now and both times my wife's tacos were cold!!! First time she ordered carne asada and what is supposed to be fresh cooked sure looked per-packaged and as i said before the meat was cold. we sent it back and it was back so fast I don't think they even had time to close the microwave door. The second trip she decided to try the fish tacos and first bite in the fish is cold. how tough is it to send out hot food
0,"I love their food, but hate the service. Every time I call to make an order the man is very rude and I hate it. I still order but seeing as theyre always rude and laugh when I mention something about it makes me want to stop ordering from there. Get better people with actual customer service to work there! Always sound so bitter over the phone."
0,"Great creative food\nExperience is spoiled by dreadful staff.  \nHostess are disengaged ( either texting on iPhone) or otherwise ignoring customers.  \n\nTold us wrong information regarding roof top. ( said that \""bar and tables\"" were first come first serve.  Was 5:15 on a Wednesday night.  Rooftop and restaurant was virtually empty. Companion and I sat down at a table close to bar -- few minutes later another staff person said \""hate to be Debbie downer... You can't sit here.  Only \""those two\"" tables are open seating.  Of course \""those two tables\"" were occupied.. \nIndicated the two top we occupied were for folks wanting to dine... I informed we wanted supper.  She said it would be 25-30 before we could sit there \""in case someone else\"" shows up.  Reminding her -- the restaurant was empty.  She bluntly said. \""You can't sit up here.. U need to move.\""  That we were welcome to sit outside on the front terrace.  She led us down to front -- gave us menus-  and left.  \nWe said there for at least 10 minutes.   I could see a bevy of staff lingering /chatting at the front hostess  podium just inside the door.  I got back up. Asked if the front area was self serve ( order from bar-- take your own food out) or if there was a server coming.  Few minutes later a server arrived.  We placed order.  As did others outside waiting.  \n\nEither the staff has no way of marking what tables are what.  Every time new food came out to terrace the runners stopped at every table ( Including folks already eating). With plates of food.  Asking \""is this your order?\""   \n\nThe entire experience was chaotic.  \n\nMonths ago I dined there and had similar experience.  \nFor the Price point of the food.  I expect better service."
0,"Horrible customer service and HORRIBLE time management.\n\nI came in this morning at 730 am, right when they opened. Only one other person here at the same time, he got here 2 mins before me. I ask for a basic oil change and tire rotation, so does the other guy. It takes them 15 mins just to get my paperwork ready and get my info. At 745am, the guy helping me says the car will be ready \""within 30 mins, 45 tops\"". It's 850 am and he's still working on the tire rotation, don't even think he's done the oil change yet. The guy who got here before me was in and out in 30 mins. There's 3 guys working here and I AM STILL WAITING FOR MY VEHICLE. Meanwhile, the guy I assume is the manager, has already taken 4 smoke breaks!!! Beyond angry. It's very simple, DO NOT QUOTE A TIME YOU CANNOT KEEP. Better yet, stop dicking around and do your job. There's 3 guys here, the shop was dead, it shouldn't take over an hour and a half to get a simple oil change and tire rotation. I am NEVER coming here again."
0,"Man I was very disappointed with my experience at Big Earl's.  Maybe I hit it on a bad night but the food was not good at all.  It might have been the saltiest BBQ I think I have ever had.  My girlfriend and I left dinner with that weird salt feeling on the back of our tongues.  I got the Brisket sliders and instead of strips of brisket it was diced up meat smothered in BBQ and salt.  It almost felt like it was 2 day old brisket that they wanted to reuse so they diced it up and slapped it on a slider bun, they tasted it and said oh crap that is bland 2 day old brisket and poured salt on it.  Meat was super greasy and the deep fried pickles were crazy salty as well.  I'm giving them 2 stars because the fries were pretty good and they give you about 2 lbs."
0,"I'm not usually on this side of town so when I was out and about for work I stopped in with a couple co-workers, excited to see the sign hanging saying this place had been on Travel Channel.\n  The place itself is drab looking and leaves something to be desired. We ordered our food with high expectations of service and quality, but neither was there. The prices were high & the soda fountain was broken so we had an option of canned regular coke or diet, nothing else. It took us just under an HOUR to get two Philly cheesesteaks, two orders of fries (regular and sweet potato), and the macaroni bites. \n   When the food finally arrived one barely had any meat on it (steak, provolone with onions) and the meat to onion ratio was ridiculous. The second (steak, cheese whiz and onions) was overflowing with the cheese (which I'm all for) was okay, nothing spectacular or to rave about. The sweet potato fries were okay at best and I was not a fan of the pre-brought/pre-made/pre-frozen macaroni bites that were very, very under seasoned. \n  At one point one of my co-workers got up and walked to the counter and asked the woman behind the counter if she could have a receipt for her meal (the woman had failed to give it to her and we needed the receipts for work) She immediately got snippy & rude and yelled at my co-worker saying she didn't ask for one! My co-worker replied by telling her it was for work, and she needed it. At that point the man who was cooking (assuming it was the owner) came over and told the woman to just make her a new one.\n  Not coming back here again, and will be telling others to stay away! Why wait almost an hour for a sandwich and then have rude service for asking a question? Stay away!!"
0,I guess its not bad for an airport resturant.  The service was so bad.. it took us 10 mins each time to flag down the waitress.  We got shrimp tacos that were pretty good except it only had 1 shrimp in each of them... I'd head over to gate A&B to eat at Four Peaks instead

0,"Not impressed. \nBest part of Cashew Chicken is the cashews.\nSesame chicken and sweet & sour pork tasted nearly the same.\nCold noodles and cold dumplings\nDuck was full of bones.\nSauce for duck was done sort of reduction ( not plum sauce) PF CHANGS is 10 times better.\nsatay chic curry stick appetizer are comparable to chicken on a stick with curry powder no flavor. \nThe peanut sauce worst ever. Tasted like plain old peanuts would have been tastier if I whipped out a jar of Peter Pan. \nWill not eat from this establishment again\nLobby is dingy, dirty lack of care\nBoba tea was very bland. All around yuck.\nOver priced .... Bad taste"
1,"Dont let the exterior fool you, this place is great!  My husband and I have been going here for years.  We eat breakfast here at least twice a week.  I can say that everything on the menu is delicious because i have tried it all.  We love bringing our 1 year old daughter here, the staff is friendly and the food is yummy.  A must try for sure..."
1,Dirty martinis with blue cheese olives!!!!!!!!! YUM
1,"I hadn't been to Durant's in a while but when I read Lindsey F's review about the dessert poker chip I hightailed it over there!\n\nI really went to town with this meal.  I sat at the bar and watched some Monday Night Football and bs'd with the bartender.\n\nI started with a nice glass of cabernet and the Caesar salad.  The salad was quite large and very good.\n\nI moved on to the filet medium rare with the garlic mashed potatoes.  After 60 years in business, these guys know how to cook a steak!\n\nFor dessert I ordered the Chocolate Fudge Brownie pie.  While it was delicious, I couldn't even come close to eating half of it.\n\nI scored my black poker chip for lifetime desserts and walked out fat, dumb and happy."
1,"This place is a little gem! I am so glad that there are good places to eat in the Arboretum. I went here recently with a group and everything was delicious! I had the N.C. Shrimp and grits. It was very filling and delicious, although it still can't compete with Charleston's. Very good food and excellent service!"
1,"Came here to celebrate my brothers engagement.  The place was very busy, but the servers were still very attentive and friendly even with all the chaos going on.  The decor of this place is really cool.  I always like dim lit places.\n\nThere were about 25 of us, but they were very accommodating.  The food was very good.  For a franchise place they had some good stuff.  What really stood out was the chicken saltimbocca it was probably the biggest hit at the table.  I will be back for that dish.  The whole night was great they really did a great job with everything."
1,"I love this restaurant! It's very small and cozy, but not at all overcrowded. The lighting is low and the atmosphere is laid-back so it's a great place to go with a group of friends or on a date. \n\nThe food is delicious, I love the unique foods they use to fill the dinner crepes. I tend to order the turkey, apple and Brie which never disappoints. The dessert crepes are also fantastic, sweet and tummy but not so rich that you're left with a toothache after :-)\n\nThe service is always friendly and the food gets out to you rather quickly. I've only gone right after work, around 5:30pm, so I usually beat the real dinner rush around 6:30/7:00."
0,while I have had worse pizza I really disliked my pizza. almost no cheese. the wood fired oven burns parts of the pizza.  good if you like extra crispy pizza. I do not. it was more like cardboard. and burning pizza doesnt help keeping it from tasting like cardboard.  I looked at the table next to us and the one behind and their pizza was burned also. then I remember seeing the place on the morning news and it coming out burned and I said remind me not to go there. so my mistake I went to try it.  why this place is on national best pizza lists confuses me. I have had pizza in ten places in nyc that are far better. I am guessing they use real moz.  but most of the pizza had no cheese. so yeah im very disapoointed. my budy warned me that it wasnt that great. and I posted this on facebook asking. no one I know likes this place. so do not be fooled by it making best of lists. and the service. never came back to ask how the food was. so I didnt bother telling them it burned.  they have soda bottles like mexico.and today out of diet coke. What kinda pizzeria doesnt have a soda fountain. the one meal that soda really is required along with mexican. and the old chair I was sitting in was rock hard. the problem was that it wobbled.  terrible restaunt. avoid it please. dont say I didnt warn you
1,"My most recent time, and the time before this I have waited forever to get my food, even though the line was not long, and this time no cheese on my cheeseburger! I am going to stop going here and go to Culvers, it's right across the street, and just as good, if not better!"
0,Customer service here is terrible.  Guy working there wouldn't accept my tv even though it was under warranty.  Finally had to call a manager at a DIFFERENT Best Buy location (Scottsdale) where they told me they would gladly fix my tv for free.  Not worth the hassle to go here.
0,Nothing special here. I've been here a few times for happy hour and can't say I've been impressed on any account. I like the concept of the outdoor bar but the service has been sub par in my experience. Don't be fooled by the $1.50 tacos; they come in bite sized portions. I'd recommend trying something else in the area.
1,"Came back for another tasty Craftsteak meal. The food was good but the service was atrocious. We were seated and told our server that we had a show to get to in 2 1/2 hours. We were assured this would not be an issue. We immediately ordered (since we knew precisely what we wanted) and thought this would be a quick in/out since it was not particularly busy. Long story short.....we arrived at our show late. The drink refills came slow, food came out slow, and we waited for our ticket for what seemed like an eternity. I am only knocking off one star because the food was still tasty (but not as tasty as I had remembered it being). \n\nWe will give it another try the next time we are in town but perhaps we will do it after a show!"
1,This is by far the best bbq in East-Central Illinois and it has one of the best beer selections around to go with it.\n\nNearly everything is made from scratch and has that creative twist you only get when people really care about what they are doing.
1,"If you wanted your chocolate fix, this is the place. A wide variety of chocolate drinks and foods. Love their shakes! Can get packed, as it is a like on the small side."
0,"***DON'T*** GO TO CELEBRATE A BIRTHDAY.  I was floored! $135 in food for 4 people to celebrate my husband's B-day and they don't do anything, we would have gone to the Black Angus or CARVERS they are near the same area, just as delicious steaks *and* less money $!!  At least at those places we would get a candle in a brownie just so we could say that we had him blow out a candle for his b-day.  I can't justify $28 entries that do not come with a soup or salad in this economic climate, and NO hospitality, so even though the food is good we won't be returning because we really only go for special occasions go to Carvers or Black Angus or even Outback! Before we return here!"
1,"Best saudi arabian food and best price I have ever sern before, also they have a hooka lounge at the same store it's extremely cheaper than other hooka store. I recommend this restaurant for ever."
1,"IMO this is the best chinese that I am use to. Love their lunch specials. I work down the road and for lunch at $5.25 you get a soup, crab rangoon, entree, and rice the portions are big so I usually have left over for the next day."
1,Love this place! I had a Ruben and my husband had the signature roasted turkey and stuffing sandwich. Food was EXCELLENT ! ! Mac and cheese was nice and hot and the orzo salad was seasoned perfectly. Only reason that my rating is not 5 stars is because of the clunking noise coming from the beverage cooler. Very annoying. Don't pass this place up if you're in the area. Will definitely be heading back soon!
1,We had a very good dinner here. It is a nice place with good service and decor. I had a stir fry which would I would recommend. Soup was excellent. Would come back!
0,"We had a pretty bad experience. A couple of things were the cause:\n\n1. Ordered a burger with fried pickles on it, but then when we got our order we got an order of fried pickles and were charged for them. We got our money back, but they still charged for the pickles on the burger and didn't apologize. \n\n2. Bacon cheeseburger didn't have cheese on it when I got it. Pretty weird. \n\n3. Food was something we could have made at home. Fries had almost no seasoning. \n\nWe were just unimpressed with this place. We went be going again and wouldn't recommend it."
0,"Perhaps I came here on a bad night, but I'm just not on board with the majority in the case of Reverie. Disappointing too as I so wanted to be given it's proximity to Jennie's.\n\nCame here for a lowkey Valentines night for some drinks and burgers. Met by an uber-nervous waiter, we were seated in a great spot by the window.\n\nWhen the food came I was underwhelmed. Not so much for me - my food was average, nothing more, nothing less - but for Jennie, who ordered the Halloumi Burger. Only it would appear they got 'halloumi topping' confused with what the 'burger' should be. Two measly strips of halloumi on top of a pallid salad, sandwiched between bread that made up twice the percantage of the meal than the filling.\n\nOn top of that, the other negative points contributing to this review are the less-than-friendly barstaff, pretty much scowling at every order, if they decided to pay you any attention at all that was. And the band, who didn't even start setting up til after 10:00pm, right around the time we decided to pack it in and leave.\n\nNot even the charmingly bunglesome waiter could rescue the experience."
1,"When I moved down here this was the first course I played on. This is a great course with a tuff layout, the tight fairways don't give you to much room for error. That being said it was a blast from the different levels of tee boxes to the awesome 13th bunkers and 18th hole view it was a fun experience. The staff is great and very accommodating!"
0,"I came in here at 2am to be seen for a horrendous sore throat that hadn't been letting up for a few days. After being there for 3 hours, the doctor told me I was suffering from post-nasal drip, and there was nothing to help me. I ended up calling in sick to work the next day, and at 10am called my PCP. Thankfully, I was told to come in right away. Upon being seen by him, he took one good look at my throat, told me I had a bad case of bronchitis and laryngitis, gave me a 3 day Z-pack, and I started to feel better just hours later.\n\nThanks for nothing, Concentra. Including wasting my money for no actual services received!"
0,"I must have gone on an \""off' day. The Buffet was definitely a disappointment in all aspects. We went there for dinner on Tuesday, and it was $36/person.  We were lucky enough to get a VIP card, so we didn't have to wait too long for a table. \n\nFood: 2/5\nI came here with really high expectations, based on the reviews of this place, but sadly, my hopes were dashed upon tasting their food.\n\nPrime Rib: 2/5 (First slice: Well done and dry; 2 slice medium)\nVeal: 4/5 (best dish of the entire buffet)\nSushi: 0/5 (Spicy Salmon roll, fishy and nori wrap was wilted)\nPoke Tuna: 3/5 (OK)\nCrab legs: 2/5 (Not much taste if you eat without the butter.)\nGelato: 4/5 (Creamy and smooth, best of the desserts)\n\nEverything looked old, food quality is comparable to Hometown Buffet.  No oysters, and sushi selection was lacking. Quality of food was sub-par. Workers really seemed unhappy and apathetic.\n\nService: 3/5\nAverage service. Plates could have been removed more quickly, and waiter rarely came to check up on us or refill our drinks.\n\nAmbiance: 3/5\nOutdated compared to the other high-end buffet places.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nFor the price, I'd rather save my $36 and have lunch at Bacchannal (Cesar Palace)."
0,"There is a reason the flights are so cheap...they charge you 100 dollars if your bag is over 50 pounds but they'll give you a trash bag to put your items in to check and then you don't have to pay. Oh, I guess that extra five pounds really doesn't make a difference then does it. Why would I put my belongings in garbage bag to get tossed around? I even to them I was military on leave orders and it didn't seem to matter. Awful airlines... I'll pay extra to fly with Alaska."
0,I wasn't impressed at all.
1,"This place is phenomenal. I'm never disappointed when I get food from these folks.\n\nI live right around the corner from this location and it's difficult not to end up here every day. The food is awesome, the service is amazing, and the location is great.\n\nLet's start with the food: I consistently get the Euro Fries. They are absolute to die for, the solo that they put over top mixed with the great flavor of the pork belly makes these a sure fire hit. I'm a bit of a creature of habit when it comes to this place. I almost always get the Carne Asada dog or the Philly Dog. The way that they cook their hot dogs (deep fried) makes the outer casing crisp and crunchy while still preserving the flavor inside the casing. Their bread and butter are the sauces that they put over the dogs though. Good lord, they are absolutely unreal. I'm salivating just thinking about them.\n\nNext, the service. The gentleman that is the head chef at this location almost always is the one that rings me out and takes my order. The awesome thing about that is he remembers the particulars of my order from my previous trip. It's absolutely unreal, he has the most amazing memory. The funny part is that the meal is so heavy (but amazing) that I try and only go there once every couple months. Trust me, if I didn't have stomach issues, if be there weekly.\n\nThis place is hands down one of the best spots in Vegas. I love food and I love finding little dives that are in hidden pockets of Vegas. I never have an issue recommending this place because I KNOW that whatever they get, they'll love."
1,Amazing staff! Amazing office and even better dentists. We love this place and would never consider going anywhere else.
1,"Delicious Italian food.  Cheese Ravioli in brown butter sauce with pistachio nuts, excellent."
0,"Deuce, tell your waitresses if they won't acknowledge your female patrons then your female patrons won't return.  We arrived to a semi-empty lounge at 1am and seated ourselves in the middle of the lounge.  We waited and waited...20 minutes passed with zero services from the waitresses who were all over the other predominantly male tables.  We decided to leave rather than beg for service.  No thanks.  Never again."
0,Don't waste your money!!  Completely over priced and bad quality as well.  I expected better from a restaurant in city center.  Shiybu at MGM is way better!
0,The service and the food has gone so downhill lately. Used to be so much better. We complained to the guy who said he was the manager and his name was Jerry. He just stood there and laughed at us. I guess when you do so much business you don't need to care about your customers or in this case ex customers. I wish yelp would allow negative stars.
0,"This is pretty much the same as any other LB store. It is fairly large so they have a good selection but I have never really experienced good customer service here. I always prefer stores that are not in a mall but in this case I guess Tempe Marketplace could be considered an outdoor mall so parking can still be a problem and traffic getting in and out of the complex can also get hairy. Overall, not my favorite place to shop."
0,"My first experience here was not bad (personally speaking). Someone was bleeding in the packed waiting room. It was busy; none of the medical professionals stopped to ask the bleeding man if he was ok. And it was apparent that he was in pain because from time to time you heard him groaning. My second time here (1992), my sister, older brother and I were in a car accident; my sister & I were rushed to the hospital in an ambulance, but we were left strapped in the gurneys for a few hours before getting any attention. Ridiculous. I should've known, since witnessing the bleeding man in the waiting room incident, that we would be ingored as well.\n\nThe expansion of the hospital brought on a maze-like feeling, as you were trying to get from one place to another, but finding that it's only confusing the hell out of you. You can walk and walk and walk. It's kinda like the street layout of Las Vegas- they didn't think that the city was going to get bigger and that's why the streets end and reconnect whereever they want (Harmon goes through UNLV, Spring Mountain turns into Sands that turns into Twain, etc.).\n\nFast forward to the sexual assaults that some patients fell victim to, the bankruptcy, the CEO getting charged with embezzlement- it's no wonder why this is a hospital to avoid. Unfortunately this is The hospital for trauma."
1,"When I'm in Ahwatukee and want to grab a quick bite before a movie next door at AMC, Vincent's is my go-to. \n\nThis is a no frills pizza place, but damn do they deliver on taste! \n\nLove the huge White Slices (Spinach, healthy garnishment of Ricotta) with a pint of Blue Moon.  \n\nYou can't go wrong with the price, either, and you won't leave hungry!\n\nThe Garlic Knots were also great. \n\nGreat customer service, too. Years ago, I met my friend here for Pizza and beers. \n\nWhen the server dropped our pizza on the floor, he comped it because of the wait time. \n\nOutstanding customer service! \n\nI heard a rumor that they closed recently. Sure hope this isn't true. Ahwatukee is the land of strip malls and  crappy chain eateries -Vincent's was a refreshing change."
1,"Amazing food! The salad bar was the best I have ever have and the meat is unreal. The staff is constantly bring food to your table. Service was ok, our waitress seem to have an attitude. I know its just one experience but that is all I got. I gave it four stars because the crazy high price."
0,"I went to this vet for almost 2 years and can't remember any of their names...isn't that strange?  I started going here because another co-worker took her dog here.  One of the first visits was because my cat was peeing on things.  The vet said, \""well, it's a male cat, they are pains in the ass.\""  I should've known right then and there this was the wrong place.  Well, my cats don't get sick very often so I just kept bringing them there for annual check-ups and shots. \n\nWhen my cat Floyd started getting sick, we started visiting more and more.  The 2 different vets recommended all sorts of tests, which all came back normal.  The last time I went, the lady vet who I had never seen before recommended another test, which we did.  At this point, it had been 2 months and I was at my wits end.  I ended up taking Floyd to another vet along with his test results.  The new vet immediately saw abnormalities in the results and it turned out that he had stomach cancer.\n\nThe worst part is that the vet at my old place didn't even call to discuss the last lab results with me.  I had to call and get the results sent to the new vet.  then a week after I put Floyd down, Spencer Springs called to ask i I wanted to discuss the lab results.  I coudn't believe it.\n\nHands down worst customer service.  They are not personable and it seemed that they couldn't care less about my pets."
0,"We were looking for a place to eat one night and were just going to randomly choose a place, and then we walked by here and saw that it was jam-packed, line waiting to be seated and so we all looked at one another and walked in thinking: \""Wow, the Pho must be amazing!!\""  and... it was ok, definitely not the worst Pho I've had but it wasn't the best either. I guess I just don' t get it because the Pho back home is so much more rich and flavorful, this just tasted like slightly flavored water to me.\nThe service was ok, and the seating is tight so be prepared to sit next to someone who you don't know.  I'm sorry to say that I wouldn't be a in a hurry to return here."
0,"More like Sl\u014d. I went there for lunch and it wasn't crowded. As others mentioned the ordering is confusing, especially because an order taker wasn't in the front area when I walked in. I ordered the chicken pita, fries and diet coke.  I was disappointed with the time it took to get my food, but I figured hipster fast food is worth the wait. I was wrong. The chicken was bland and the pita was hard. I was hoping the baked fries would be good, but the were very cold. I took 3 bites of the sandwich, had a couple fries and through what was left of my $9 lunch in the trash. The diet coke was delicious, however. Gr\u014d is too sl\u014d and not worth the d\u014d.."
0,"Due to a last-minute change in travel, our Vegas trip was suddenly extended by a couple days.  So we decided to take in Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e had never ridden in a helicopter, so she started quickly doing research to find a reasonably priced tour. Thats when we found Grand Tours LV (AKA \""Let's Go Tours\""). http://www.grandtourslv.com\n\nWe opted to take their Grand Canyon Tour - West Rim Bus, Helicopter Boat Tour for $249 per person. This gave us a bonus of riding the bus across the Hoover Dam.\n\n2 hours later, we're on a motor coach heading over towards Hoover Dam, and then on to the west rim of the Grand Canyon.\n\nThe driver (who I might add NEVER introduced himself, so we'll just call him Mr Driver)  seemed nice enough at first. As we were picking up guests at other hotels, he got on the PA and gave us some info about Vegas - namely the large construction projects in the north strip/downtown area that had gone bankrupt.  I wasn't really interested in hearing about the financial woes of large corporations that don't know how to balance a budget. But what ever. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later, we arrived at Hoover Dam. The bus did a U-turn on the Arizona side, made a brief stop at a souvenir shop, crossed back over the dam and on to the Grand Canyon west rim - about another 2 hours away.\n\nAll was good for about the next 90 minutes. Occasionally Mr Driver would key the mic and tell us some bizarre trivia he thought was noteworthy.  \n\nThen for the final 30 minutes to the West rim, he keyed the mic... and never shut up.\n\nOf note - the last 8 or so miles of the trip include a passage down an unpaved road with many twists and hairpin turns. Mr Drivers microphone was a hand-held mic - not a hands free headset. Given the road conditions I felt he should have had BOTH hands on the steering wheel, and not blathering about the Joshua trees, or the fact that the road is unpaved (Umm, DUH!  We can see its unpaved).\n\nThe dirt road was dry (obviously - we're in the desert.)  But somehow, airborne dust from outside was finding its way inside. Just enough of this fine dust got into my eyes and irritated my contact lenses to the point that I had to remove them.  So much for being able to take in all the splendor of the Grand Canyon (thankfully I'm not totally blind without my glasses.)\n\nHere is where it gets strange.  Mr Driver explained how the 3 hours we would be at the West Rim would work.  He must have explained it 3 times, but never in a clear, coherent manner.  Other riders were confused as well.\n\nPart of our trip included a meal voucher, which Mr Driver said could use to get BBQ at one of two locations - some place simply called \""The Ranch\"", and another food stand at Guano Point (appetizing named place to dine, huh? LOL)\n\nMr Driver said we could do what ever we wanted; just to manage our time and be back on the bus NO LATER than 2:25 or risk being left behind.  Fair enough.\n\nBut OF PARTICULAR NOTE - he also said that if some of the people got back later and didn't have enough time to get lunch, he'd make a special stop at The Ranch so people could get carry out and eat on the bus.\n\nAll in all, the helicopter / boat portion of the trip lasted about an hour and was amazing (run by another company I might add.)  Upon our return to the airport, we looked at the time, and we had just enough time to take in the Canyon view at Guano Point.\n\nSince Mr Driver had told us we could make an extra stop at The Ranch, we figured we'd rather spend the last hour of our expensive tour taking in what we'd paid to see - the splendor of one of the Wonders of the Natural World.\n\nWe arrived back at the airport and boarded the coach at 2:10 - over 15 minutes to spare. This is when things went downhill.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e said \""thank god you're going to stop for food!\""  Mr Driver said \""I don't know where you got that idea.\""  This turned into a back and forth argument between us and Mr Driver for the next 3 or 4 minutes. He said other customers were laughing at us (they were not) and that we were making fools of ourselves.\n\nWe never threatened him, but we were told to \""stop or their is going to be trouble.\"" When asked to clarify what he meant by \""trouble\"" he said \""I can refuse you service.\"" My fianc\u00e9e said \""you're going to leave us here?\"" and Mr Driver replied \""if need be.  We advised him he and the company would be sued if he tried, and that finally shut him up.\n\nThis man obviously skipped class in 'Customer Service 101' the day they taught the #1 rule - \""The customer is always right.\"" I have NEVER seen someone in the hospitality industry show so little regard for simple, customer service, LET ALONE GET CONFRONTATIONAL WITH  CUSTOMERS WHO JUST GAVE HIS COMPANY $500!\n\nWe contacted the company and in all fairness, DID receive an apology from them & they are investigating the incident. Hopefully we might receive a partial refund for the meal portion of our trip, but I'm not holding my breath, and certainly not using this company ever again."
0,At first this apartment complex was great. Then things started going downhill. The management did a terrible job on the end of lease process and I would definitely advice others of looking else where for a place to live.
1,"I had read about this locally-owned business in the Ahwatukee-Foothills News and then noticed a coupon in the mail.  We were having a party in a few weeks and the carpets were a mess, not to mention the three areas that had been snagged/ripped from when our Puggle was a puppy.  It was perfect timing to give a new company a try.\n\nI called and scheduled an appointment for carpet cleaning and repair for the three spots.  The woman on the phone was kind and helpful.  She answered all of my questions and scheduled my appointment.\n\nWhen the man arrived to clean the carpets, he was very friendly, knowledgeable, and easy-going. He even went into my attic to get the extra carpet for the repairs!  He worked quickly and even put up plastic guards to protect the corners of the furniture and walls so that the hose didn't leave any marks from being dragged through the house.  And he had little booties on his feet (OK, more like big booties) so that his shoes didn't get the floors dirty.\n\nTwo things to be aware of.  1 - This time, my carpets did take a little longer to try because I didn't go with the company that has the fast-drying chemicals.  This is the organic stuff, no short cuts here, but a much better feeling than having chemicals under your feet!  2 - No credit cards accepted.  Check or cash.  No biggie, as long as you have your checkbook on had.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with the quality of service and quality of work that I received from Barefoot Organic.  Plus, all for a very reasonable price!  I will be sure to use them again and highly recommend them for your carpet cleaning or repair needs."
0,"They did not mind that my ID was expired while I was losing...as soon as I win, they take the winning and say I can't play then kick me out the floor... Wtf."
0,If I could give no stars I would.this place is a pathetic excuse. They do not acknowledge your presence one bit. Pretty sad since their items I would have wanted to rent since I am a customer frequent online. Although since I wasnt even noticed nor my husband they lost a customer. If managment does read this please do your self a favor and RE-train your staff for both females wish I got or saw their name does not know what customer service is.
1,"This place looks like it needs to be updated to be comparable to other standards hotels have now. However, they play host to The Price Is Right Live and that is a plus. The area the theater in is not the best place for a long line for future contestants to wrap around, and I feel they should adapt to that or figure a way to rope things around."
0,"In their defense, I will open this review by saying they have only been in this location for a week. HOWEVER, they ran a business at another location so that \""learning curve\"" thing should not apply.  The atmosphere is not there yet and that is okay - they gotta get the furniture and decor going but first things first - food and drink and servers.\n\nWe came after reading so many good reviews of their Phoenix location - and with LivingSocial in hand.\n\nIt is apparent that they still need to figure out how to run the front side of their business - there were 6 tables occupied with 3 servers, a bartender, two management types - and i think it was the owner that came out of the kitchen and took our beverage order.  Really? And those servers were running like chickens without heads.\n\nWe tried to figure out what the coupon covered but couldn't get a straight answer so we just ordered 2-meat combos with one side each.  The brisket was a $2 upcharge so we ordered pulled pork and brisket, one with slaw, the other mac and cheese.\n\nUnfortunately, I think they had to go chase that damn pig down (not the cow, for heavens' sake - those animals are slow and there is no chasing involved) because it took 50 minutes to get our dinner. 50 minutes. almost an hour. now, let's think about this.  that meat was already smoked. the mac should have already been made. and the same with the slaw. what would take 50 minutes? i have no flipping idea. \n\nWhen the meals came, they both had mac and slaw. I said something to the server who said well that's how they come. Sigh. If we had known they were coming with two sides, I would not have gotten slaw with my mac and my hubs would not have gotten mac with his slaw.  This is like the story of the Reese's peanut butter cup with not such a sweet ending LOL  And....no bbq sauce.  Hmmm. Let me see.  BBQ restaurant. Ordered BBQ.  Maybe you want to put some on the plate?\nIn their defense, they brought it upon request.....in a teenie tiny little salad dressing cup...... bwahahahaha..... \n\nPulled pork was nicely seasoned. Tasted like a shoulder to me.  Good and smoky. Moist. Little bit of charing on the outside.  That cow, however, did not fare nearly as well. If the poor fellow would have known that is how he would have ended up, he would have fought harder at that slaughterhouse - or at least tried to run a little faster. That brisket was well on the way to jerky-dom when we got it. And - it was tasteless. Seriously. No smoke. No rub. No moist. Just dry meat. So pork yes, beef no.\n\n Slaw? Meh. Very mayo-ish with not much else. I am a creamy slaw girl myself and still make it the way mom did at the restaurant.  I figured it for a southern slaw place but they apparently ran out of celery seed that day as there were maybe 3 seeds in a serving so it was a rather lackluster slaw. \n\nMac was.......odd.  It was cheesy  No egg. Not a baked mac. But it was REALLY greasy. I know that mac can be that way depending on the cheese you use. Mine had a large puddle of grease in the bottom of the monkey dish - however, the hubs' didn't. Proof positive that sometimes the grass is greener - or at least less greasy - on the other side of the fence.\n\nSauce? Not my favorite. I think it was a home-cooked sauce as it had that shiny cornstarch kind of look maybe - but it was perhaps too cumin-y for my taste and hubs wasn't so keen on it. So maybe that is why they serve it in a teenie cup cause that is enough. I ended up spreading the mac on my meat since I had nothing else.\n\nSo now the bill comes. Here's where it gets more interesting. The deal was for 2 dinners with sides and beverages.  The value of the deal was $36.  Our bill came to $28.  The server presents us a bill where we are given $18.95 credit - so we owed $9+. Wait a minute. Let's do that math again. They must have gone thru the Common Core teaching program as in my mind $36 is greater than $28.  In their defense, after I said \""no, try again\"" they decided that we were square. Sigh. What was that all about? Had I not opened my mouth, we would have ended up paying $50 for two $15 dinners plus sodas. Nice markup if you can get it.... here's a novel suggestion: if you are going to run a deal, then figure it out BEFORE your customers get there then teach your servers how to handle them. Don't offer a deal then go - duh, we have no idea what to do with it.\n\nI wanted to like this place. Really, I did. We have a meetup group and I am always looking for small businesses that we can intro our members to - but this, sadly, is not one of them. Off in search of local places for our next dinner......"

0,"Came here for the first time today after having dinner near by and was not impressed. I have already been to the one on St. Laurent or in Brossard so expected big things. I was fairly disappointed. I ordered the \""youngster's bowl' ice cream which was very disappointing. I usually order a brownie when when i visit the other locations but thought i would change it up and wish i hadn't. There was more whipped cream than ice cream (above and below the ice cream). The vanilla tasted slightly freezer burnt. My friend ordered the caramel brownie and said it wasn't as good as usual. Something about watching the waitress take it out of the microwave and bring it straight to your table, kind of alleviates the charm. I think i will stick to the other locations next time."
0,"I shop at all the Whole Foods in east LV. I despise this single Whole Foods. Despite the huge space, it never has 1/2 the things(brands, etc) I need in stock. Maybe it's the proximity to the strip... but they always have broken containers of something in what seems every aisle and every day looks like an outofstock, friday aftermath. Lame. I only ever have this problem at this location.\n\nThe staff is Great... But the produce/seafood stations are oddly small, the store never gets the basic/special items all other locations seem to have each month(premium sodas, good aged cheddar, hard shell crabs) and the sushi's... not worth trying (as noted below).\n\nI highly recommend the one in henderson on green valley, unless you enjoy being pissed off (and constantly putting in requests for... everything)."
1,"I've eaten at the Atwood location once.  Considering the place was packed, and we had a table of 8 people service was adequate.  One meal took a little longer than the others to come out, and they did apologize for it.  This is one of the few places in WI, where I can ask for something hot (spicy), and it actually comes hot.  I have yet to try anything here I don't like.  If I'm in the Madison, or know of someone passing through.  I usually have them bring something back for me.  I enjoy it that much.  If this location is too busy or your looking for something more intimate, check out the williamson location.  I'm actually waiting for a delivery as I type!"
1,"EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!\n\nHad a 6:30pm reservations for Christmas eve and was placed at the best seat in the house. We overlook the entire dining area, had a table for 6, for us two, in an area with huge dining table and lounge-y corner... LOVE IT!!\n\nThe waiters are super helpful and  knowledgeable about the menu. Very good at explaining the meat cuts and were very attentive... Definitely one of the best service we have had in a very long time!\n\nFor food, we ordered the kobe beef sashimi, tuna tartare, my bf had the steak tasting and i had the american wagyu mignon... and to top off we had bone marrow and potato puree as side... \n\nEverything was WOW, the tuna tartare had avocado on top which really works well and kobe sashimi.. YUM!!!.... The steaks were really good, melts and yummy.....except the bone marrow makes the steak a little too greasy (personal choice, shouldn't have gotten it! but that's my thought).... Lastly we got the banana creme pie... never had it, but loved it... we got 1 to share, should have really gotten 2!! haha.... \n\nWish Wolfgang opens up CUT in NYC!!! would love to make another visit!!"
1,"Holy Elephant Balls, Buddha! This place is incurrydible!!! Okay, okay I'll stop.\n\nSo my wife and I decided to hook up for lunch.  She works downtown so I decided to head down that way and pick her up.  I suggested Thai Elephant because I had never been, and she raved about the Pad Thai she had ordered a couple weeks ago.  It's located on Adams just West of Central Ave., and parking is scarce.  Make sure to have some change for the meter!\n\nI knew I was at home when I saw the \""People Love Us On Yelp\"" sticker on their door.  It was about 1 pm so the lunch crowd wasn't in FULL effect.  There were about 10 empty tables in which we had our pick. We sat by the window.  My wife ordered the Drunken Noodles with Chicken (a la medium), and I ordered the Green Curry with Chicken (a la medium).  A round of Thai Tea was also added to the bill.  Our food came out in about 4 minutes, which came as a shocker! Yes, I said shocker... I was pleasantly surprised!\n\nThe moment I slammed my chompers onto the emerald dripping chicken, I became green with envy. Envious of all the people who have eaten here in the past and had such a precious secret hidden up their sleeves.  I sniffled a bit, but not from emotion.  It was the green curry and its beautiful spices stroking my mucus glands in just the right way.  A bit of rice and a sip of the Thai Tea (I'll get into in a second) and I was right back on track.\n\nThe Thai Tea. Ooohhhh, the Thai Tea!  It was $2.50 and twice as large as the ones I order from The Street.  It was like being chosen by Ganghis Khan to sit alongside him in Xanadu and drink the Milk of Paradise (Rush Reference).  It was sweet, as you would expect paradise to be, and creamy. I began to float out of my chair and harpies wiped my nose as I sipped the golden brown goblet of goodness.\n\nService was Spectacular\nFood was Fabulous\nPortions were Phenomenal\n\nDare I say it? 5 Big Ones, Mr. Elephant... and I shall return!"
0,Whoever manages the place just doesn't seem to care. Lots of things broken or missing.The obviously 25 year old air conditioner was slow but at least it worked. If you have a choice stay somewhere else!
1,"Absolutely tasty!!! This place is one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to. There mixture of Indian, Tibetan and Nepal is a  refreshing blend. The first time I went there I asked for paneer pakora which wasn't on the menu and the owner went to the kitchen and made me up a plate which tasted amazing. They have lots of beers from India and alot of lassi drinks. Just to prove my taste buds are on the level I recently brought a friend who's wife is from India and she said very tasty and top notch. Well worth it. Nice atmosphere as well."
1,"I absolutely LOVE this place. Every meal that my husband and I have ordered here has been excellent! They serve only the freshest seafood you could ask for, cooked to perfection! I recommend the Seafood Market & Restaurant over Red Lobster any day!"
1,"Great Way to Spend the 4th.\n\nBeen awhile since I've been to Outback and they have revamped the menu a bit.  Slightly different focus with all of the favorites still there and a couple of new offerings. Also, at least this one is now open for lunch during the week so there is a new lunch menu as well.\n\nMy wife had here favortie Alice Springs Chicken.  Normally I would go with a Beef Entree but opted for a new offering of Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken with a side of mixed vegetable.\n\nOnly negative was the bread they served. It was a very dark bread that looked with an Eastern European bread with none of the texture and none of the flavor.  Fortunately that was the only downside.\n\nMy Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken was great.  The flavors and textures complimented themselves well.  My wife was also happy with her Alice Springs Chicken which again, is her normal order at Outback.\n\nService was excellent and the manager did stop by our table and spoke with us which is always a good sign.\n\nAtmosphere --- What can I say?  Typical Outback.\n\nIf you're in the Carolina Place Mall Area, this is a nice spot for Dinner and now Lunch"
1,i am giving 4 because its my savior in charlotte when it comes to indian food..\nBut can be improved a lot..
0,"On my inaugural visit I was not at all impressed.\n\nWe had to wait 15 minutes to be seated, even though the restaurant was 3/4 empty.  Then, after ordering, I was presented with a Baby Spinach Salad without any dressing on it at all.  The Buttermilk Biscuit Croutons were very good, but the dish just did not come together as a whole.\n\nThe fairly large shrimp in a Shrimp Cocktail were meaty and cold, but not that tasty.  And the Horsey Sauce accompanying this app was just too mild.  When my entr\u00e9e at length arrived, its diminutive appearance was quite underwhelming: two small fillets of Pan Seared Trout with Cilantro Rice, cut carrots, and Sweet & Sour Cabbage that was not juicy and neither particularly sweet nor sour.  The trout tasted better than it looked, but it was just average in quality.  \n\nService was very inattentive, and there was a long break between preliminaries and delivery of the entrees.  Seating was comfortable, but the whole vibe was more that of a coffee shop than a casino's featured restaurant.  It would be pretentious to call what was served to my party of four \""fine dining.\""  \n\nReportedly a new executive chef is now in the kitchen, and some new menu items are already being phased in.  But I highly doubt that I will be back.  Even at a special January promotion price of 50% off for locals with a Downtown Grand My Points player's card, I did not feel that I got good value for my money.\n\nXX-1/2 stars overall!"
1,"This place has a very cool vibe to it.  We decided to sit outside but the inside is darling.  The bar is also nice front and center as you walk in the door.  Waitress was ok.  She sort of disappeared right before we were ready to order.  Other then that the service was decent.  We started with a melted cheese similar to Brie it was good but the portion was very small.  We also shared a small roasted peach salad with arugula which was fine.  Two of the diners had the Halibut.  Again very good mix of flavors but very small portions.  The other diner had the lamb bolognese.  Another small portion.  We had two deserts a chocolate cake and a butterscotch pudding.  Hadn't had butterscotch pudding in years and it was good and rich like it should be.  I was with all women and I barely felt full when I left.  I think my husband would have left hungry had he been there.  I would be willing to give this another try for sure.  On a side note, I always leave Zinc Bistro hungry too."
0,"Ehhhh didn't stay here very long. We arrived on a Sat at 11pm and waited about 25 min in the guestlist line. We all got in for free with no problem. The actually liked how the club looked. All white with purple lighting. \n\nWe headed straight to the bar since they had open bar for girls until 12. The bars were slammed! The open bar only included vodka-cran and vodka-sprite. I really wanted a vodka soda since I don't like sweet mixers. They serve the free drinks in a really big cup so it tastes really weak. We went back to the bar around 11;50 to get one more round and wait and waited. It was 11:57 and I was about to order and the bartender said open bar is closed. Uhhh wtf. She was such a b*tch! I also saw her snap on a customer. Like damn I know it's busy and you have to deal with drunk people all night, but shit! Show atleast a little customer service. That's what being a bartender is all about. You gotta be able to handle yourself.\n\nThey main room played mostly top 40 and hip hop. The upstairs played EDM, but was way too packed. While we were leaving we saw another room with less people that played rap. The best part of Pure was being in the rap music room and watching the funny random stuff they had on the tvs. \n\nI would pass on Pure. It was way too packed and the guys there were ignorant douchebags."
0,"GROSSLY OVERPRICED !!!\n\nThis is a Franchise ..... not the Orginal.\nMy opinion ... the food dosen't match up, to the original.\nMind you .... its OK, but certainly not Great.\nThis location is 4 miles from my house.\nI drive past them, on my way to eat at Taste Of Chicago, for my dogs.\n\nMy wife and I, usually don't agree on many things.\nHowever, we agree on  giving Luke's a pass."
1,The food here is so damn good.  The bacon jam is good on almost anything.  The sliders have so much flavor.  The donut bread-pudding was sinfully delicious.  You meet cool people here.  It doesn't appear to seat a lot so I recommend a reservation for weekends.  I wish they had a bigger menu because the flavors are WOW.
0,"I came here because locals get a great discount for the buffet. Too bad you get what you pay for. \n\n@ Raw Oysters - Not fresh. They salted it to try to hide the unfreshness. My stomach got a really uneasy feeling the next morning. Since I was the only one in my group to get the oysters, I suspect this was the item that got me sick.This is what really brought them down to 1 stars. \n\n@ Prime Rib - The staple meat at all buffets. 2 of the 3 was really dry and almost burnt to a crisp. 1 of the 3 was at least red, but still wasn't very good. It just lacked flavor and the goodness of a prime rib.\n\n@ Lamb chop - Why can't I get my meat more rare? This was just cooked perfectly for the temperature, but I want my meat bleeding in a puddle of blood when I eat it!\n\n@ NY Steak - Cooked a notch above medium rare, was actually not too bad. Much better than the 1st or 2nd prime rib and lamb chop.\n\n@ Shrimp Cocktail - Flavorless shrimp. Yum Yum. *rolls eyes*\n\n@ Mussels - This was drenched in sauce, thats why it tasted okay. I guess you're eating the sauce here, and not the mussels. \n\n@ Salmon - This wasn't that bad. It was cooked just right and the fish still retained the natural flavors before it was seasoned to death. \n\n@ Orange Pork - If you're not Chinese or you lost your Chinese card you will enjoy this dish.\n\n@ Pork Dumpling - No flavor at all. At least it was warm. \n\n@ Mash Potatoes - Was this really mash potatoes? Needed to seasoned more and actually mashed. Its mashed potatoes, not chunked potatoes. \n\n@ Pasta - This is  made to order. The chef will make it to you're liking. Pasta was acceptable, but just don't expect anything exciting with it.  I don't know why they give you a big plate of pasta, enough for 2 people.\n\n@ Apple Pie - Tastes just like a regular apple pie. Nothing too exciting about it. It just a mediocre item. \n\n@ Bananna Cream Pie - Same as the apple pie. Nothing to really write home about.\n\n@ Brownie - Just decent. Not bad or good. If enjoy brownies, you'll get your fill.\n\n@ Cheesecake - Best item in the entire buffet. If you come here, you absolutely must get it. Now, its not to the same caliber as Cheesecake Factory, but since everything tasted so mediocre, this will taste exceptional!\n\nOur waitress was very friendly. She was really attentive with clearing our plates in a timely fashion and bringing us our drinks. Nothing more you can ask for a buffet.\n\nBreakfast is $5 for locals $14 non-locals. Lunch is $6 for locals and $15 non-locals. Dinner is $8 for locals and $20 non-locals. Sunday Brunch is $12 for locals and $19 for non-locals. You just need to sign up for the Players Club (free) to get these prices. You also get a nifty keychain with an LED light that doubles as a bottle opener. You can buy up to 3 non-locals buffet, if you have a group that want a cheap buffet. This is applicable on Sundays, Monday, and Wednesday.\n\nThis buffet is really small compared to the bigger buffets at the strip casinos. Food is pretty bad, but I've tasted much worse. Unless you get the locals prices, move along. Be sure to skip the raw oysters! Spend a little more at the other buffets and enjoy your meal (and not get sick)."
0,"I went today to use a groupon and they were out of almost everything.  No sandwiches, no vegan cheese, no whole wheat pasta.  The place was dirty and empty and I was there at noon.  I finally ordered enough to spend my $30 groupon,  and after a couple minutes, the employee came to tell me that she didn't have the ingredients to make what I ordered.  I'm really surprised this place is still in business.  Thankfully, Groupon refunded me the $14 we payed for the groupon.  We ended up having a nice lunch at Cafe Rio."
1,"I have been here three or four times for lunch. It's pretty close to my work, so it's very convenient.\n\nI have had the meatball parm and sausage parm sandwiches. Both were very good. My friend has tried the chicken parm sandwich and liked that as well.\n\nI've also tried the garlic knots, and while I liked them not sure if I'd order them again. Not because they're \""knot\"" good, but because the sandwich fills me up and I wasn't able to finish them. Maybe I'd get them and share.\n\nI haven't tried the pizza yet...maybe next time."
0,"I love cheap Chinese food, however, New Golden China seems to take the \""cheap\"" concept a bit too far... \n\nThe food is actually on par with some other truly cut-rate Chinese joints I have experienced in the past in the sense that there really isn't any quality or consistency to be had. Menu options are extremely standard fast-food Chinese fare (orange chicken, mongolian beef, etc.). But, the veggies aren't fresh, the soups taste like liquid filler and meat products used in their dishes are highly questionable at best (i.e. beef doesn't look or taste like beef, chicken doesn't resemble chicken, etc.).\n\nAccording to the hand-written stickers on the back of their menus, New Golden China now uses something called \""chicken powder\"" in their food. When I questioned the owners repeatedly about this, it was explained to me that it serves the same purpose as MSG, in that it mentally \""enhances\"" the flavor of their extremely low quality food, while also acting as a filler, so smaller portions fill you up faster! Well, I don't know how you get powder out of a chicken, but you are certain to get plenty of it when you eat here!\n\nThough I don't have any real negative comments aside from hinting at the questionable cleanliness of the kitchen (and sometimes staff) or the unexplainable 60-minute wait for a single dish when you're the only one in the restaurant, I really can't find much positive to say, either. \n\nMost people will find that it's very easy to spend too much here for what you get in return, especially if you are feeding more than just one or two people. \n\nIf you're really in the mood for cheap Chinese, there are several other places in the immediate area that offer much better quality food for just a little more money."
1,"With a name like Spotted Donkey I was expecting this to be the kind of place where they offer $2 Coronas and Taco Tuesdays. So I was surprised when I walked in to discover that this was actually a nice, sit-down restaurant - like the kind of place you might take a date. (Not that cheap tacos and beer can't make a great date, but you know I'm sayin')\n\nSome co-workers and I were working late in the area so we decided to try it out. I would describe their menu as traditional Mexican food with a twist. To start we ordered a quesadilla with pork to share. It was outstanding! First, it was huge. Second it was loaded with pork - they did not skimp. Third, it was delicious. The pork was nice and tender and drizzled on top there was a garlicky sour cream that really made this entr\u00e9e great.\n\nFor our meals, I ordered the tacos (2 beef, 2 shrimp), co-worker 1 ordered the burger, co-worker 2 ordered the chopped salad. The tacos are like street tacos - small corn tortillas. I really liked the shrimp  - had a good little kick. The beef were good too but the shrimp was better. My co-workers gobbled up their choices as well. The one with the salad said it was one of the best salads she has ever had.\n\nOverall, the service was good, the atmosphere was nice and the food was very tasty. I would go back for sure."
1,"After living in Tempe for 18 months and making more trips to Rula Bula than I can count on one hand, I figured it was time for an update. I'm still not wowed by the food - baked brie and the chips w/Killarney Sauce are the only two items I will order because they are both really good. \n\nThe outdoor patio is awesome. I've always had fast service and even though it does get crowded at night, I never feel super cramped. The only thing I didn't appreciate was before an ASU football game a few months ago, I wasn't allowed to order two drinks at the outdoor bar because they were both going to be for me. Apparently that wasn't allowed - lame. Indoors is still a lot of fun especially due to the live music. Bar service inside is fast for me, but that's probably because some of the bartenders recognize me from how much I frequent Rula Bula.\n\nI'm bumping Rula Bula up to four stars because I always have a good time drinking there with my husband and friends. Plus we always meet interesting people and have fun stories when we leave. Go for the drinking and music, not for the food."
0,"Apparently my expectations were tooooooo high.  Was told by foodies that this place was a must eat.  However my pool attendant said it wasn't.  First where is the \""fusion\""?  The menu had food from both places but nothing that mixed them.  The waiter said we had to have the best taco in the world...carnitas.  Being from San Diego it was just ok.  The salsa for it was worth the $5.  For the main course we got the Mongolian beef lettuce and Kao Lao Loa noodles.  We were told it was family style so it would be plenty of food.  If you consider 5 small pieces of beef and a plate full of lettuce enough then you are in the right place.  The one piece off beef I had was good.  Too bad they are too cheap to actually make it family style.  The worst part was the noodles.  When I order noodles I expect a plate full of noodles.  This was individual coils of noodles stood up on their end in a bamboo steam pot.  There was 20 noodles with a tiger dipping sauce.  I almost spit up up the sauce on the first bite.  Was like dirty water.  Way too much hype very little to actually eat.  I will never go back."

0,"Was overcharged in April 26, 2014.  I called several times and finally got a call back from Kelly 2 weeks later.  She told me to email Eric and I would get my money back that I was overcharged.  It's been a week.  No call or email from Eric.  Why did I think I would get anything other than no results!\n\nI would say that they do not know what customer service is.  If you pay, pay with cash or risk getting over charged and good luck getting your money back.\n\nI will let all I know to do something other than go to Cowtown.  What a pain in the neck."

0,Not worth the time. We went on a Friday night and were thoroughly underwhelmed. Took 20 minutes to get drinks. The appetizers actually came before our drinks did I have never seen that before. The onion soup was pretty good every one else's appetizers were roughly OK not bad but not exactly up to the expected quality that the name attached to the restaurant would suggest. Main courses were nothing special the flat iron steak was disappointing basically a fancy way of saying fried -undercooked on the inside burnt black on the outside I'd say that was quite an accomplishment if it wasn't my food. Wife had the fingerling potatoes that the waiter suggested we're the best potatoes he's ever had. My guess is that he hasn't had many potatoes then. They were very bland. One of our number had the fish and chips and seemed moderately happy with it though so perhaps only 5/6 people leave disappointed. Mr Ramsey should be embarrassed to have his name attached to this place. We Will never return here.
0,"We made the mistake of eating at the Stable Grill. It had been a while since we had been there. The service was terrible. The food was also nothing to write home about. I think it will be another five years before we venture back, if ever again.Very disappointing.."

0,"Visiting my parents and my Dad suggested this location for a better selection of items, wasn't really impressed, for a large store it was very dirty and items were out of stock. It wasn't very busy and upon check out there wasn't many registers open, we passed up the 10 items or less counter being we had 16 items to two lanes over, there was a women ahead of us with  quite a large cart and price matching as well. I am a patient person so i waited....and waited. My husband had been watching the 10 item or less lane with no one in it for some time and decided we should move over, when we started to unload the cashier said \""no, no 10 items or less only\"" pointing to her sign. I explained we had been waiting on the other lane, patiently, with no movement. She stayed firm to her \""no\"". At that time another lane adjoining her opened up and we moved over. As this cashier rang us up another couple started to unload at 10 items or less lane, the checker began ringing their stuff and right off the bat there was about 8 t.v. Dinners and they had about 10 more items in their cart!! i couldn't believe it, when i asked her why my 16 items were too much but there's wasn't? She quickly tried to tell the couple  they'd have to move (after she bagged half their stuff). But then she continued on, she could've at least apologized. The only reason they are getting a star is because the checker that did check us out was very apologetic and offered the manager. This Walmart really needs to work on its customer service!! (the lady in the first lane we were in was still price matching as we left)"
1,"I read a Yelp talk thread that was singing the praises of Niccoli's Deli & Pizza a couple of months ago. So I decided to take the plunge after my office moved to CenPho.\n\nThis is a Mom & Pop place that's been around for over thirty years. I talked to the Mrs. for a couple of minutes explaining that I was the new kid in town. She explained the setup where you order and they call you if it's busy but will bring your meal to the table if they're not swamped with customers.\n\nThey don't have a soda machine. They sell individual cans. I ordered the meatball sub sandwich. The bread was really soft. They cut up the meat so you don't have your meatballs falling out of the bread like most meatball sandwiches. They have a lot of marinara sauce on the sandwich and it is piping hot. The ladies out there can probably only eat half of the sandwich, that's how big it is. I would say that it had to be one of the tastiest meatball sandwiches I have ever had.\n\nI definitely will be a regular customer of Niccoli's."
0,"Went here last night with my daughter and sister place was empty. We asked for a table and were told to sit anywhere. We order drinks received them fairly quickly and was asked if we were ready I asked for the sushi sheet. Went and asked the chef if they had any specials none asked if they could be creative and maybe add some sauce to the sashimi like ponzu, roasted garlic something. Didn't get a vibe that he was interested in being creative. Are server who had no personality what so ever never once smiled of course until the check was brought asked if we were ready not offering any information or advise. We ordered a couple rolls that were pretty good. Won't be going back just for the fact. If poor service and lack of creativity I'm used to sushi chefs wanting to create and impress I guess zony's won't be getting any of this. The fish was fresh except one piece of tuna was extremely cold almost frozen might have been to close to the chilling vent. Pinky lady roll was nice and spicy the hunami (misspelled) was taste and the dynamite like all others taste and the scallops not over cook as some do. Wish I would have looked at some of the pictures the sashimi platter looks exactly like what I wanted and asked the chef to bad service was so bad they could have recommended this platter and we would have left extremely satisfied I guess here u have to figure it out yourself.\nOh forgot we also ordered the taco expecting spicy tuna with avocado onions and some creativity but it was over whelmed with a crab mix kinda disappointing."
1,This place is my 2nd fav restaurant in LV. There fresh pasta is outta this world. For appetizer I recommend the calamarie HANDS DOWN best calamarie I ever had. Service is very good and there desert menu is good I don't recall the name but I got a cup of chocolate and a few Pastries on the side and you dip it the fresh melted chocolate.. If you want good Italian food come here!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (:
1,"$35 non locals, $21 drinks (double shot though black label on the rocks) Lmfao was there and it was popping. Champagne showers all over the main dance floor. Free shots for some girls in front. Lots of classy only look no dance girls every where. This place could use another room with different music."
1,"I love this place.. All the girls are funny and sweet.. My technician Gaby is beyond perfect.. I give her a basic color and she finds the best shade and she can do any designs!!!! Prices are good and I love the fact they take their time.. You'll never need to worry about them rushing to get the next person in your seat. Clean, stylish, and fun atmosphere!!!"
0,The reputation of this place was stellar!  I was stoked to try some new food.  I got a dish that had the mole on it.  Definitely not for everybody.  I literally scraped this thick molasses-like substance off my chicken and it still tasted like I was eating sauce only.  I ended up eating a lot of chips for dinner that night.
0,"Portion sizes are extremely small, which is weird for an indo-pak restaurant. Food is alright. The owners were nice so they get 2 stars for that. Probably won't be coming back here."
1,"YES INDEED, this is the best game in Vegas...you might have to scavenge for it during the MGM remodel but....but it's SO SO SO worth the stop."
1,"Food here is great, had the chicken schwarma with salad and rice. My partner had the same with hummus, I heavily endorse eating here. I'm coming back that's for sure. Also they have lovely baklava."
0,"Never coming back here. The ac in our van has gone out more than once and hasn't been fixed properly yet, we were here a month ago and they said it was fixed.  Also, we need new o2 sensors and they are overcharging me to fix it.  They told me around $550 for two to be installed, I found them quite cheap on the private market and was able to get them installed quite easily.  Each o2 sensor was about $67 and was installed in less than ten minutes."
1,"I go to the Crown & Anchor whenever I'm in the mood for some chicken fingers (\""Chickens don't have fingers!\"") and homemade curry sauce in which to dip them. Yum.\n\nThe place is dark, which I prefer. They do, indeed, have bangers 'n mash on the menu, as well as a Scotch egg (a hardboiled egg wrapped in lightly spiced sausage) and a steak 'n kidney pie. If you're hankerin' for the fare of the lovely UK, then this is where you should go. \n\nThere's only one bit o' beef I got with this place. Due to some sort of ... something ... on their liquor license, you can not order hard likkah at the bar. You have to be seated in the dining area, you have to at least order a plate of fries, and you must have your server bring you said likkah. Kind of a bummer when you've been sitting at the bar with a group of your buddies, and someone has the grand idea of ordering a round of car bombs. Everyone has to get up, go to a table, order some food, wait for the server to bring you your shots ... kind of ruins that whole spur of the moment, \""Let's do a shot!\"" thing.\n\nThey do, however, also have sticky toffee pudding.\n\nSo, basically, go for the food and the beer, but do your drinking elsewhere."
1,We love Tokyo Express! Been going for years! The food is always fresh and well prepared. I get a large teriyaki bowl with double chicken after the gym for some good carbs and protein.  The sushi is nothing extravagant but tasty.
1,"This place was pretty awesome, one of the tastier (and boozier) yards we had while in vegas. We must have gotten a good bartender because he was very friendly! (we had a couple questions like if we could mix flavors and stuff) compared to some of the other places we saw they didn't have as many flavors of drinks, but it was still pretty yummy! And I swear they poured at least a fourth of a bottle of rum in my pina colada..."
0,Bad. Only good for 21 year olds and the creeps that want to stalk them. Tasteless interior and expensive drinks. Bad dj.
1,Had Happy Hour on Monday at the Borgata location.\nLoved the appetizers.The ceviche is outstanding. \nHad the Quesadilla with Chicken (very good) and the tacos with pork. Delish!\nI had the berry margarita. Loved it. My husband has a beer.Beer was OK. There are better brews in Phoenix. \nService was very good.\nWill be back!
0,Totally not worth the ridiculous price to hang out in a relatively small area and get sun burnt. Three words: VDARA death ray.  Enough said.
0,"I hate this place. Don't waste your money. We ordered the king size combination which was $80 and I swear they gave meat enough for one person. Service was terrible and after we confronted them about the meat and how little it was 3 people, they told us that we should have gone some where else for all you can eat KBBQ and just stopped coming to our table. I love KBBQ but I'm never coming here again. I thought it was us but I have never had such a terrible experience. I've worked with customers and I would never in a million years tell people that they should have gone some where else. For $20 a person, you can go to tofu hut and get AYCE KBBQ. Which would have been $60 but no, we paid $80 to get half hungry stomach. I would definitely recommend you to go somewhere else because this place is terrible with service and food."
1,"Had a nail in my tire. By checking reviews on Yelp at my area decided to go to Discount Tire. First time and great experience - 30 min, my tire was repaired and it was free. Great experience. Will be back when i need new tires!"
1,"Knowing my love for Salsarita's on Rea Road, a coworker and I decided to head there for lunch. We arrived shortly after 12 and, like others have mentioned, the line was out the entryway.  However, even though the line was long it moves smoothly and didn't take too long.  Salsarita's has a rhytmn that seems to work, like an assembly line. I ordered the two taco combo with chips and queso, and a side of salsa.  I chose two soft tacos, which are steamed and topped with a meat, of which I chose chicken and pulled pork. Onto the toppings, lettuce, jalepeno, sour cream, guacamole and cheese to complete my order.  The chicken, just like the other location was great and the pulled pork was awesome, I wil definitely try that again.  The chips were fresh, some with a little extra seasoning that I love.  The queso was a little cold, but overall good.  A definite great spot for lunch, but may need to think about getting there a few minutes before 12, just to get ahead the large crowd."
0,"I was not impressed with this restaurant.\n\nFrom what I have heard the restaurant has changed chefs (if there is a chef) and you can tell as this place has an identity crisis. It is stuck between a formal Italian restaurant and a modern trendy restaurant which just leaves it as an awkward ambiance. \n\nWe went on a Thursday night and sat in a side room they had. The night started off on the wrong foot with our waiter who made it apparent that he was not sure what he was doing by how he was acting. \n\nThings continued down hill as we received our appetizers. We ordered an olive plate, shrimp, muscles and calamari. It all seemed too prepared in advance and came out modestly warm. When our entrees came out we had the same experience. The food tasted alright, but nothing to think twice about. \n\nWe also ordered desserts including ice cream and fried custard. From the reactions at the table, the ice cream was good and they do have a lot of different flavors, but the fried custard was not what i expected. I was expecting more of a Mexican fried ice cream, but received warm fried custard with pistachios which I was not expecting. I will give this dessert the benefit of the doubt as I bet some people would have enjoyed it. \n\nOverall I cannot recommend this restaurant."
0,"We came here for the Titanic Exhibition...while we were here, the beau and I decided we wanted Ramen on such a cold night. We Yelped it and found Monta and Sora however, we wanted to run it by the locals! So...we walked over to the Concierge and she (and I'm not kidding here), asked us \""how do you spell Ramen?\"" I almost fell over as I'm looking around and seeing almost 80% Asians walking around! Worst part is, there was an ASIAN lady next to her that DID NOT JUMP IN to suggest anything. Worst part was, she was pulling up just the word \""Ramen\"" not YELP but GOOGLE?! Oy, we would have been there all night waiting. Awful horrible employee at Concierge, learn to look things up on Yelp or better yet, here is a line you should learn \""will you excuse me while I find someone who might be able to point you in the right direction?!\"" Can't believe how ignorant she was. Yes, this is ignorant when more than half of your clientele are ASIANS!!! Just wow....Yelp saved our next night! Thank you Yelp!"
1,Food comes in large portions. I like the fact that they leave a coffee pitcher and at water pitcher on the table for quick refills. Service is good. Food is good Breakfast food.
1,"Great new restaurant for locals!!!\n\nAtmosphere:  I was greeted by friendly hostesses that were dressed in authentic geisha kimonos. Cool, trendy, sleek decor with great music. I came here with my boyfriend and dined inside the restaurant, but they have a beautiful patio setting that I will definetly take advantage of the next time I visit. This is the perfect place to bring a date to, or even for a classy dinner for the family. \n\nFood: The sushi was immaculate. The fish was extremely fresh and vibrant. Their ponzu sauce is delicious! It's been a long time since I've had the privilege to taste this quality of sushi. With the entire town flooded with ayce sushi restaurants, it's been nearly impossible for me to find a sushi restaurant that prefers quality over quantity. My boyfriend tried the braised short ribs which he described as melt in your mouth delicious. The Serrano hamachi dish was very inventive. This is usually one of my favorite dishes, but I've never seen it made with yuzu foam which made it outshine all the other places I've tried it at. We also had the lamb pops for an appetizer, and we had to order an extra order because my boyfriend loved it so much. All the dishes were tantalizing to the taste buds.\n\nService: Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and patient with our questions, and trust me we had a lot of them to answer. I don't know much about sake, but I wanted to try something new. The server gave me a quick 101 on the different sakes available which made it much easier for me to decide from. The managers came by and checked on us to make sure we had a good experience, which was really nice to see that everyone was eager to serve us well. Most of the things we ordered were recommendations from the server, and I'm glad she was so informative about the dishes. She also served us ginger coffee chocolates at the end of our meal that was complimentary. A perfect ending to a perfect meal.\n\nPrice: With the decor and presentation of the food, I would imagine the dishes would be quite pricey. However, that was not the case at all. Extremely affordable prices that I would actually pay double for, but I was glad to be able to enjoy everything for such a great price. \n\nGreat job GEISHA HOUSE! I will be a returning customer for sure!"
1,I've seen 4 cirque shows and this one if my favorite so far.\n\nPrices are steeply discounted if you buy on the day of and if you buy the late showing.\n\nDon't worry about purchasing the cheap seats because every seat has a clear view of the stage.\n\nI highly recommend!
0,"I called this company based on reviews I saw on Angie's List.  When I called I think I talked to a \""Sharon\"" we started off ok and then things went south rapidly!!  I tried to explain to her that this property to look at was in escrow and that there was a lock box on the door which the realtor would give her the code to so she could gain access. Easy enough or so I thought.  She suddenly acted very put out and started quoting prices without even looking at the flooring -not to mention she couldn't  see the property for two weeks!!  Her blatant lack of enthusiasm and overall \""sour attitude\"" led me to quickly end the conversation and move on..Maybe she was tired clearly she did not want or need my business..."
1,"Great company, will go no where else with my heating and air conditioning needs. Came out on New Year's Day, fixed my problem with the heater, and charged me only $70.  It coulda been so much worse. Thanks Legacy!"
1,"I've been taking my dog here since we got him in 2012 and can't believe I haven't yet written a review in support of Dr. Grossman and his staff.\nDr. Grossman is a wonderful, knowledgeable vet and has helpful and friendly staff who take great care of our dog.  I had to call them today since my poor puppy was having stomach troubles and despite being booked up for the day, they were able to squeeze me in to get my dog the medicine he needed.  We will keep going back."
1,"Highlight of the trip!\n\nMy friends and I were rocking this nightclub for the first time.  We enjoy the pool time!  Dance floor, full of people like other famous nightclub."
0,"As George clooney said in O Brother Where Art Tho.....a geographical oddity, 2 weeks from everywhere. I don't know if it was just our list but the things we were shopping for (hamburger, buns, etc....) where not readily available. Crazy strange huh......oh well, we improvised"
1,"I've got something of a love affair with this place. It's becoming a regular part of my life now... and I am okay with that.\n\nIn the past, I would go here for lunch... their freshly made sandwiches are absolutely delicious. Given that I now work about 25 miles from here, that's somewhat... difficult. So instead I now go here after my early morning South Mountain hikes. Turns out their smoothies are quite fantastic as well. I believe the general consensus amongst my friends and I has been \""heaven in our mouths.\""\n\nOn top of that, their selection of local produce and related products is unrivaled. Delicious fresh fruit (of which they're usually handing out samples), local honey, locally made salad dressings, salsas, jams, and much much more, make this place to die for. I get all of my best fruit here, without a doubt.\n\nOne thing to note though is that you should bring cash here! There is a small additional charge for paying with your credit card, as it's expensive for them to process."
0,"Met up with two friends here before we went to a pool. I was late so they had already ordered food before I had arrived. As I was looking at the menu, their food came and they both ordered some type of tacos, well both of their orders had hair right on the top of their food!!!! I understand this happens from time to time, but for it to happen on two entrees at the same table just really made me lose my appetite! They sent their food back, we paid for our drinks and went to eat at the pool. Even without the hair, the food looked barely edible to begin with. Definitely won't go back unless it's just for drinks."
1,"One of the best buffets I've ever been to!  I hate to admit this (a sin in my family really..) but I am not the biggest fan of buffets.. I admittedly don't eat that much, and I always feel like I'm torturing my tummy to get my money's worth ): Also, they're a wide selection of food that's usually mediocre at best..  Bacchanal (however you pronounce that), however, definitely changed my mind!  Yes, there were MANY MANY choices, but I honestly did not feel pressured to have to eat everything, because the seafood section was amaaazing!  I cannot tell you how many times I went back for more seafood, especially those fresh oysters. And crab legs. So good. Really the highlight of the buffet I thought.  Their carving station was pretty good too, I enjoyed my ribs a lot. But wow. The seafood.\n\nWarning - the wait can be kind of torturous, but they have this electronic system where you sign up on the machine and they text you when you need to come back and get in line, which is kind of nice so you can walk around and do some shopping or gambling while you're waiting.  The wait IS about an additional 15 minutes after they text you though.  Also, the \""estimated wait time\"" that they show you after you sign up might not be very accurate.. I'm assuming it's because people drop out. Our estimated wait was 90 minutes, but it only took about 20 for them to text me back. So just be prepared for that!"
1,"oh yeah they updated the soy cheese used to a vegan version and it is super tasty! Get some tonight, Vegans Unite!"
1,"You won't be disappointed.  No high pressure sales pitches, no contracts, just good, honest chiropractic care.  Always friendly, quick to accommodate and very affordable.  I just can't say enough good things about Dr. Hedrix and her staff."
1,"Good portion flavorful food best in Gilbert so far. Their hot and sour soup is to die for, my kids love their Orange chicken it's actually real chicken not just skin and batter with sauce. Every bite is real chicken. It may be a little more price wise as compared to other mom and pop Chinese placed but it's worth it because they put a lot of meat. Never try to cut corners whatsoever. Their vegetable Kung pao is a great option for vegetarians"
0,This is a ghetto club. Our $11 shots came in those small plastic bathoom cups. Seriously? You can't trust your patrons with glasses? \n\nThe bouncers were pretty nice. Our party got split up and one of them let them in when we caught sight of them. He even waived our GF's cover and knocked ten bucks her husband's cover. \n\nOverall though....didn't enjoy myself as much as I wanted. Don't think I'll be coming back.
0,Def a case of style over substance. Tofu is flavorless and everything else over spiced. Super small portions for the price. Kids' Mac and cheese served cold. Bleh.
1,"Joe's gets a 5 star for service, price, atmosphere, and food.\n\nCame here with a group of 4 around 2pm on a Saturday in mid December. We were welcomed in and seated right away.\n\nThe service was great and everything we ordered was very good.\n\nThe steak was cooked perfectly and the sea bass had a delicious miso sauce. The best item was the banana cream pie! Save room for dessert or get one to go! If you normally don't like desserts because you find them too sweet/sugary - this is the dessert for you.\n\nThey are known for their stone crab claws but I probably wouldn't get it again. It is served cold and I prefer my crab warm. \n\nYou can't beat the prices for the quality and type of food and service here in Las Vegas."
0,"This place has to have the worst service of any bar that I have been too.  My wife and I went back 4 times because the food was just that good and we had hoped that the service issues where just a fluke.  After the 4th bad experience with the service we are done with this place, which is unfortunate because we really wanted to keep going back for the food.  Between the very slow service, inattentive staff and lack of a good attitude I rather go somewhere else where I actually enjoy the atmosphere.  We even went here one night that they were having a party and saw the servers hanging out at the party with, what appeared to be, their friends and colleagues and ignoring the customers.  If they can get a good manager in this place it may survive but after 2 months and 4 visits I haven't seen any change."
1,"What's not to Love. This company is a trend setter & we feel blessed to have them in our town!  The Quality... The training they give employees... The whole experience is extraordinary.... We love when they have the big stems of Brussell sprouts. Also, the way they grade their grass fed beef. There is not a better quality if burger meat around. Such a great place!"
0,"This place is a rip off. I adopted a dog last year who was 12 years old. I did not have his records nor knew of his condition. I took the dog for a check up and exam. Banfield pet Hospital staff talked me into buying their health plan for over $45 a month. Several months later my poor Felfel died due to a liver disease.I called them to cancel the plan since my dog had already died, but found out I had to continue paying into this plan for another four months.\nThis place only cares about taking your money. They are outrageously expensive for everything including shots and doctor visits. After my experience here i checked the prices at more than 22 other pet, and found 20 of them cheaper than Banfield."
1,"Knowledgeable and helpful staff.\nHUGE facility with everything you could want by way of aquarium (saltwater and/or freshwater) equipment and supplies, as well as a huge selection of fish.\nAlso a decent reptile section.\nThe Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated has a couple huge aquariums. The freshwater is set up and has had some fishes for years. The saltwater is notably bigger - and not currently set up. He wanted some new fishes and some plants for the freshwater tank, and this is his store of choice.\nHe chose plants and a couple Baal sharks, and suggested I pick a fish I liked. I don't know much about fish, but really liked the shape and grace of the black angelfish, so he got one for me.\nLooking forward to years of fun and lots of leaning about aquariums - and happy to know Ocean Floor is nearby for all the fishy needs we may have."
0,This place is a close second to the worst pizza I've ever eaten. The service is good but stay away from the pizza.
0,"Pizza crust was excellent! Place was very clean  Hostess was friendly and helpful. This is the extent of the good.\n\nBad ... over-priced, waitress/bartender was rude when I asked a question on the menu - then ignored us, pizza was BLAND/TASTELESS - also the canned mushrooms and ham were very watery.\n\nI wanted to like this place - I have driven past it hundreds of times wanting to stop ... I will not be back.\n\nWhen we left, I handed the hostess a comment card with my concerns. I expressed to her to please make sure the GM sees it. She said OK. However, no attempt to maybe get a manager then or ask for contact information - found that to be a form of poor customer service."
1,"Like it a lot!\n\nProbably quite a grown up bar. We headed here later on - closer to 11ish on a Friday night (V-night) and it was pretty quiet. It used to be the old Standard Bar - black frontage and from the outside appeared small but the bar is actually quite tardis like inside. Mix of chairs and tables, high stools and some booth areas which I'm sure would appeal to groups or those on date night alike. \n\nThe gin is the main draw here. They have a list of the common gins they do on a blackboard and with which mixer they should be served - Fentimans or Fever Tree. I had a Caorunn and a Botanist, both of which were very easy to drink. It won't be the cheapest round of drinks - two G&T's were about \u00a310 but very enjoyable. Other gins can be seen on the shelves - Caz opted for a Boodles and they also do Blackwoods gin too which is lovely. We missed on on trying the saffron gin as it had been their launch night the previous night and they were out of that.\n\nNice surroundings - wooden floors, tables and chairs with blue/grey walls. Not overly bright inside but good enough for a late night supping gin. They also do food - didn't see any menus as they'd probably been moved from the tables. There was a bit of an older crowd in last night when we were in which was good to avoid it being too 'hipsterish' and the 80's soundtrack was fab. I'll return to further explore the gin menu and try the food!"
0,"Do NOT go here!! Beware!!!\n\nI decided to have my car towed there in distress after my front brakes locked on me while I was driving. I had no choice being that it was almost the weekend & the closest repair shop to my house. \nIt was late afternoon (couple hours before they closed) & I talked to the guy, who was really nice & assured me he'll check what up with my car. I know a little about cars but was really nervous knowing how mechanic shops work with girls knowing they'd try to rip me off but he seemed to ease that worry.\nI had to leave my car overnight & the very first thing I did in the morning I called in to check on my car since I hadn't heard from anyone the night before. He told me he had really bad news that I needed to flush my brake fluid, replace ALL 4 rotors, break pads, hose, calipers &master cylinder!!! A $2,100 repair job?!??! Freaked out I called a mechanically inclined friend of mine told him the deal & he was even surprised & told me that couldn't be true & suggested I got a second opinion. I thought why not & another friend recommended I take it to Master Transmission Automotive (Allllll the way in boulder city). Since he was certain I have them take a look at it I towed my car all the way across the city. The following Monday I got a call from Master saying all I needed was a brake fluid flush & that cost me only $120!!! \n\nThe moral of this review is that Tirewors will try to rip you off especially if you're a girl!!! \n\nIt's been a few months now & my car runs great, not having to replace all that crap tireworks told me I needed. What a place of BS!!"
0,"Interesting, but unauthentic.\n\nI was looking forward to coming here.  I have become a foodie. My wife and I love to try new places and support local restaurants.  Rice Paper was on my list of places to try.  The place looks like a converted residential home turned restaurant.  The place was clean and trendy.  Service was great and friendly.  The server even brought our dogs some water to drink out side.  However the food didn't fulfill my expectations for a truly Vietnamese meal experience.  There was a lacking of authentic flavor in our dishes.  I believe the Pho was lacking in taste and substance as the meal was very humble and seems shy in the true taste of Pho.  \""Enlighten me\"" spring roll was interesting as well.  I did like the crunch from the fried wonton skins in the roll however the jalapeno was a bit overpowering for me.  Salads were forgettable too. \n\nRatio of authenticity (ROA)  #Ethnic Patrons/Total # Patrons 0.1 (includes my party).  Although not very authentic in Vietnamese cuisine, it did show potential in some of their originality in their spring rolls. \n\nPrice was high as it is rare to have the price of pho at a whopping $10.  \n\nThere are plenty of other Vietnamese restaurants which is worth the experience at half the cost.  (You may have to put up with poor service, but at least your stomach will be satisfied.)\n\nIf you find this review funny, cool or useful please check below."
0,"Great place (albeit pricey) for people watching, but they suck when it comes to gluten-free options.  They put on their menu that they have gluten-free buns (nice!), but almost everything on their menu is chock full of gluten (even Hollandaise sauce, which is just wrong, IMHO).  Server was attractive but uneducated about gluten-free.  Such a big, beautiful menu, but the gluten-free options were the same sad limited choices as any other restaurant's.  I ordered the Angus burger sans bun with goat cheese (an extra $1.50) in an attempt to spruce it up, but I needed a microscope to see the cheese.  Thankfully the cocktail was good."
0,"I assumed that the BBQ chicken would be some sort of grilled chicken, not just chicken with BBQ sauce (at $1 extra!!!) that sadly just does not taste good in a burrito. \n\nI am disappoint."
0,Absolutely terrible customer service at this location. The front end manager has a horrible demeanor . She will suck the life right out of your morning by overcharging you. Every time we use this location the work is shotty and we have to have the car go through the line again
1,"So, lunchtime, eh? This is a new experience, as dinner has been the chosen time for Ave. B. Do NOT worry about having a reservation. When I got there at 11, I could have told my friend, \""I booked the whole place just for us!\"" Lol. \nService was wonderful, and after being asked, the waitress was very up front about what she liked the best when she got to eat there for lunch. She recommended the falafel wrap, which my friend ordered. Holy crap, it was amazing. \nWe both started with the grilled romaine salad with raspberries. It had a dressing on the side that definitely had a touch of anise. I thought the greens were exquisite, but the dressing was not to my taste as, say, a balsamic may have been.  \nEntrees were, as I mentioned, the amazing falafel wrap with sweet potato fries, and I ordered the miso-crusted salmon which came on a bed of seaweed salad, drizzled with a balsamic (?) or sesame glaze. OMG. The salmon was done perfectly-medium rare with the skin on! Yes!!!! All of the flavors mingled in a mix of deliciousness. Perfect playing. I snuck a bite of my friend's wrap and fries just to get  the taste, and I would easily recommend this dish. It may be what I get next time. \nMy only experiential criticism is that the chalkboard menu is only for dinner. Really, though, it's hardly a complaint. \nAnother great meal at Avenue B!"
0,Small skinny sandwiches with high price-tried it once never again.  And openning up across from subway wasn't to smart.
1,"Richardson's is wonderful! It is so cozy and romantic. Generations of love birds have enjoyed dates at Richardson's and hopefully many more to come! I am vegetarian and I always get the Garlic Pizza. It is just sooooooooo good. There are limited items on the menu for vegetarians but so worth it!! Music is good, atmosphere is good, food is good!\n\nLove it."
1,Wow!  This place is amazing.  So amazing I went there twice in a week.  I will start with my dinner.\n\nThe ambiance was great.  The place has a nice warm feeling to it and since it was cold outside it was really nice.  They had a large fireplace inside and after dinner we stayed for the great crowd that showed up and went outside.  It was pretty chilly but I didn't even notice as the fire pit was big enough to warm everyone around it.  They also had ample heat lamps.  \n\nThe food was fantastic.  I had the tomato soup with the grilled cheese crouton in it and it warmed me up and prepped me for my main meal.  I had the burger and tender belly bacon.  This was an amazing treat for my taste buds.  The bacon was not like any bacon I have had on a burger.  It was a perfect complement for each other.  I wanted another one when I was done but couldn't possibly eat anymore. \n\nThe drinks were great.  They have an amazing wine selection.  The wines we were drinking were affordable and it looks like they really spent some time picking the right wines to carry.  They have some really nice wines that rival the selection of some of the really nice wine bars in Scottsdale as well.  My friends said that the mixed drinks were really well made and they were very happy with how they turned out.  They have just about everything you could want for mixed drinks.\n\nService was amazing as well.  They were really attentive and the owner stopped by to talk to our table.  \n\nLunch\n\nThe lunch was just as good as the dinner.  I had a shrimp BLT that rivals anything in AZ.  I was glad to see that had a variety of Dr. Pepper/Mr. Pibb on tap.  It was really relaxing to sit there at lunch and enjoy the crowd.  The service was excellent.\n\nOverall I highly recommend Vintage 95 for lunch or dinner.  It is a great place for a date at night and you can enjoy the great crowd afterwards with great conversation and ambiance to fit.
0,"I cancelled my service with CenturyLink in April 2013 after they had their nationwide outage.  I called in to cancel and it was cancelled, thought. I continued to receive bills to my automatic pay account and when I discovered this in July, I called again and they said it was never cancelled. I spoke to two ladies first said I owed the entire bill. The second said no and credited off the balance. Then the next month and each month following I get a bill for some unknown amount.  \n\nToday when I called I ended up talking to three different people and got three different explanation as to what the balance was. \n\nIf you read CenturyLInk's agreement, the only thing they guarantee is that you owe the monthly payment. They will do best effort is providing internet connectivity with no liability for not doing so. \n\nBe very careful using CenturyLInk and always take good notes with names, date and time in any communications. They say they have notes on all communications. They do have a record of my call and the two conversations, however they have no notes as to what was discussed.  How convenient ."
0,BLAND!!! No flavor in anything. Don't waste the walk from your car inside. I've had better Mexican at Taco Bell. The best part of the meal was my diet soda. After our plates were cleared it took over 20 mins for the waiter to bring our check. Not recommend AT ALL!
0,"I have been going to Geno's since it opened in Queen Creek. I work late and don't always want to go home and make myself dinner.\n\nWhen I first started going I noticed that the store literally smelled like a wet dog! I turned around and left without ordering anything. I tried again several weeks later and the smell was still around, just not nearly as bad as the first time I went. This time I ordered a large pizza to go. They run a special similar to other pizza places. $5.99 for a large....but its not hot and ready. It takes them roughly 10 minutes to cook it for you.\n\nThe Pizza: Its about what you would expect for the price. It is not the best in the world, but will fill your stomach. \n\nI have not tried any of the other food, I have heard that it is ok, and a good alternative to eating a burger and fries.\n\n......oh, the wet dog smell happened to be the staff not changing the mop water. They have some new front end staff that works on keeping the dining area as clean as possible. It actually smells like pizza now."

1,Went up to see what Jimmy's was about and found a barber for life.. Great guy and awesome cut. The nostalgia and the back east feel was perfect.. Jimmy is a great guy and if you get a chance give him a try you won't be disappointed.
1,"We love Mei Wei.  We often go for lunch- it is delicious and includes soup, salad, egg roll, rice and main dish for a very reasonable price.  The staff is super friendly.  We have done take out via delivery and were really pleased.  I would recommend you try this tiny,  quaint little restaurant- the food is delicious and the staff are great."
1,Whoa! Why didnt I know about this place before!? Took a random trip to Vegas this weekend. Lost my friends at Tao so I some how ended up here at the noodle spot and I asked what was the most popular dish. The lady picked out Szechwan Beef noodle soup. And it was damn good! Serious flavor going on here and the noodles were good. Actually came back the 2nd day with my friend and got roasted duck and bbq pork noodle soup. This place definitely hits the spot :)
1,"Generally speaking, people only go out of their way to say mean things or to complain. After reading the other reviews I feel you should hear a different type of review. \nI myself have been a resident since Feb., 2014. I like it here. The office staff is wonderful and very helpful. Any work order I have put in has been done promptly. I love the fact that they always clean up their mess too =] The property is well kept. I feel relatively safe. I am thankful they don't just let anyone move in. The price is very favorable. During the day the parking lot is empty but at night it is full. That tells me that we live in a complex where people have jobs and are looking for the same things I am. A restful and peaceful place to come home to after a tough day. In closing, I just want you to know that I would choose to live here again if I had it to do all over. Thank you Colores Del Sol employees and residents."
0,"I was on a thrift store junket the other day - hitting about 6 different stores in a single afternoon. Although this store is the closest to my house, in the 8 years I've lived in Vegas, I think I've only bought one thing here - granted that was a super sweet 1960s \""Las Vegas Story\"" souvenir 45 rpm record with uber-cool graphics.  \n\nThat said though, this teeny Goodwill is jam packed with cast off clothing from the 1990s - nothing particularly cool or vintage. The shelved items are generally in disarray and the store seems particularly, um, fragrant and stuffy.  I'll stop in maybe once or twice a year, but I generally don't enjoy shopping at this location."
0,"The food is fresh and well made, the atmosphere is okay, but reminiscent of a Scottsdale nightclub, and the prices are quite high. 3 rolls and 4 orders of nigiri was $96 with tax and tip. No drinks, just water. \n\nSame food with better prices can be found elsewhere.\n\nSide note - 10 minute wait with half the tables empty. WTH."
0,"I don't know if I'm reeeally allowed to review this because we didn't actually order anything.\nBut, I'll give you the rundown.\nIt was Valentines day, or AZ Statehood day. We arrived after discovering Pizzeria Bianco had a 4-5 hour wait. We called LGO ahead and asked if they were very busy and they said they weren't. Once we arrived we were seated immediately and decided what we wanted and waited. And waited... It was 20 minutes late, and a couple that had just been seated had a waiter immediately. That's when we knew they forgot us, I'm sure the pizza would have been good, but I think customer service is a huge deal so we got outta there! On they way home we decided to order Hungry Howie's instead. Oh well, we were ready to spend $40 on pizza but $20 tasted better anyway.\n\nSo, zero stars for being ignored!"
1,"What a great way to escape the normal life and act like you are somewhere else for a day. \n\nI swear you forget where you are once you find a cove and jump in the water. There are so many places to drop anchor and have a nice time. \n\nYou can rent boats, eat on the lake, swim, ski, jetski, fish, scuba dive, etc. This place rocks."
1,"walter g is right, the wings basically taste like sauce. but thats what they are famous for. \n\nthey  have about 20 or so different types of flavored wings, if you're someone that likes to try little samplettes of different stuff, you can get the 24 wings and get 4 different flavors of wings and split it with a friend. \n\ni tried the carribean jerk, teriyaki, garlic parmasean, and asian spice.\n\nif you eat 12 of their 'blazin' wings within 6 mins, you can get your picture on their wall. \n\ni feel like i can handle my heat pretty well, so i asked the server for a sample of the blazin sauce, and i'd have to say that it is pretty spicey, but i feel like it was kind of hyped, it was expecting it to be way more spicier, so spicy where you can't taste if it is salty or flavored, its just straight spicy.\n\nit was actually pretty good tasting, i would try maybe one wing just to say that i tried it, but i would suggest you do it after you try all the other flavors, b/c i tried blazin before everything else, and everything else didn't seem spicy afterwards since your tastebuds are pretty muched seasoned to the spiciest one first. the caribbean jerk was pretty spicy good, it was an enjoyable reasonable kinda of spicy. blazin made the top of my nose sweat a little. hahaha\n\ngarlic parmasean pretty much tastes like garlic bread but in the chicken form. \n\nteryiaki was good b/c it was nice and sweet and made the chicken kinda caramelized. asian pretty much tasted like sweet and sour sauce but with some chili pepper.\n\nmango jabanero wasn't as spicy as i thought it would be, it was kinda good b/c it was nice and sweet and mangoey. \n\nthe onion rings were pretty good, it comes with liek a chipotle mayo sauce, and the small size, the portion size was pretty good for what you pay for. i thought everything was resonably priced and tasted pretty good.\n\nthe restaurant is pretty big, there is no wait, and its open 24 hrs. they have tons of sports playing everywhere, we stayed after our meal was over to watch the new american gladiators on the huge projection screen (only one that has sound). other screens are on mute. \n\nservice was good, all the servers are girls in t heir 20's in football jersey type shirts. pretty quick with your requets for more water  when your mouth is on fire. \n\ntheir dessert menu is not that great, we opted not to get dessert there b /c nothing sounded very tantalizing."
1,"Definitely one of the hipper and affordable places to go out in Montreal. The place has a really cool DJ and atmosphere. The building itself use to be an old pharmacy, hence the name Baldwin Barmacie. \n\nThe cliental is fashionable, so dress to impress here. One of the cooler features of this bar is the option to buy 8 and 16 ounce bottles of hard alcohol (as oppose to the standard 26) which makes it much more affordable and cool. When you buy one of these bottles, you get all the mixers you want for free. Try it out!"
1,"Not so cozy and no menu, everything written down on a chalkboard.It wasn't easy to read the menu. However, I ordered the lobster spaghetti and I was in lover with it. A friend had a horse steak and another couple got jarret d'agneau. Huge portions. Food was great along with service. The restaurant is noisy and loud. I would definitely go back!"
1,"This place ruined every other Vegas hotel for me.  We got comped two nights in a wrap around terrace suite and we didn't want to leave! The service was excellent and the employees genuinely seemed to want feedback on our stay.  Other than the really crowded casino floor it was a really nice experience.  As other reviews have already said this place is gorgeous.  \nThe wrap around terrace suite was the BEST hotel room I've ever stayed in. Everything seemed to work perfectly - room service was prompt, bell service also speedy, and again really friendly staff.  The terrace was the best part.  Yes everything is hi tech and contrary to some reviews, everything worked well. \nWe didn't have a chance to try the restaurants here - but room service food was excellent and the \""secret\"" pizza place was delicious.  We actually went there twice.  Will definitely go back to the Cosmopolitan again, even if not comped."
0,Does anyone read the responses from Patricia S. She apparently is an employee of the restaurant. Why support a restaurant that allows their employees to treat customers with such a bad attitude.  Gross.
0,"So this place has been through the wringer.  The whole daughter/mother fight and who is running the place played out all over the media.  I didn't know any of that when I started going here.  If it were still the way it was when I first started going there then I'd give it four or five stars for sure........sadly for them I didn't write my first review here until I had a bad experience.  \n\nI started going to Citizen Espresso Bar because they carried Jewel's Cupcakes baked goods.  I am gluten free and they had an extensive line of Jewel's products along with their beverage choices.  My husband and I would come in and grab some Joe and a little treat and I'd be SOOOOOOOOOOO happy that I could eat a cupcake or roll with my coffee.  I can't do that at about 99 percent of coffee shops around Phoenix.\n\nHowever, again this past fall, there is a switch up of who is in charge and now I cannot get any gluten free products now.  Now I wait again until someone gets on the ball and offers all of us gf peeps a place to get our treat on WITH our java.\n\nWhen I asked about it I was snubbed and told that they were making all of their products now and gf wasn't going to be an option.  Well, I determine where we go for coffee and treats due to the fact that I need to be able to eat so...they lose all of our family business."
0,"They don't take gold cards since they \""don't have the machines for it\"". The Mirage location doesn't have the machine/scanner/swiper either, but the baristas type in the card code manually. The line consisted of around 10 people and only 1 barista was at the cashier. There were 2 other baristas working there.. One making drinks and the other doing who knows what.. Ordered a grande caramel macchiato with extra caramel with a base price of $5.30. They charged me 50 cents for tax AND 85 cents for the extra syrup. Totaled up to $6.65. I got the same exact drink from the Mirage location and they only charged me $5.95..."
0,"I didn't think the food was great. The staff wasn't awesome either they kind of had the vibe like \""hey I'm better than you\"" and my friend asked for a side of salsa and never even came back. \n\nIt's SOOOOOOOO overpriced for this shit."
0,"After reading the reviews here on yelp we were pretty excited to try this buffet.  Well it was a big disappointment.  If you only want something fancy to look at this place is for you.  Many of the items are very uniquely displayed in little pots, or basket.  Otherwise, my advise is to skip it.  The food wasn't very good.  Nothing was labeled, and there wasn't as many choices as most of the buffets on the strip.  The line for the omelet bar was about 20 minutes long.  They also had some breakfast taco, but no sour cream."
0,"Once again, CATS increased its fares.  What started out as a $3 roundtrip light rail ticket is now $4.40.  This would not be so bad except that the fare is exactly the same regardless if you are going one station up or the entire length of the line. When you get a few people together, driving is actually more economical and easier.  Also, with the increased fares, you would think that everything would be operational.  On July 4th, a train that we were on broke down.  I was going to take the rail to the soccer game yesterday but half of the ticket machines were broke so there were lines at the ones that did.  One of the working ones was also selling only one way tickets.  I tried going to a different station and only one of the two machines was working there.  I drove uptown, parked for free, and it was much more comfortable and easier than being squished like sardines in a train car.  I won't say that I'll never ride the rail again, but the consumer value for me is not worth it anymore."
1,"Ate here again, last night.  stop # 3 after Parc central and Prime Bar.\n\nCalifornia squab and foie gras.  \""young domestic pigeon,\"" per wikipedia.  WAY better than KFC. i felt a little, gulp, guilty eating \""young domestic pigeon,\"" but that passed as a turned to the force fed duck (or goose) liver:  foie gras.  I think cafe bink's foi is better, but the pairing was FRENCH.  I've had less \""French\"" dishes here, and this one was French.  Y.U.M.M.Y. vegans, ummm, well, i got nothing.\n\nRoasted dungeness crab and mushroom crepes.  food porn.  not steamed, but \""roasted\"" crab.  though it had a sauce (lobster sauce), the crepe \""held up,\"" and didn't break apart.  the crab, crepe, mushroom had an orgy in my mouth and the lobster sauce just brought it all together.\n\ngreat drinks\nwaiter and busers great\nnice to see owner terry ellisor making the rounds (i hear he used to cook)\nfood \""eat here,\"" super yummy."

1,"BBQ salmon and seared ahi tuna steak were divine. The heirloom tomato salad was left wanting, the tomatoes were mealy and almost flavorless.  It wont stop us from continuing to come.  Oh, the lemondrop (I think it's called) martini is fantastic!  I don't drink anything that tastes like alcohol... I just don't like the taste, they were smooth (as smooth as anything lemon gets that is) and it was easy to drink more than one."
0,"I've been to two of their locations and I have to say this one is so dirty and disgusting. The food was good. But at my visit there one of the employees was sitting at a table eating out of the metal bowls they use to toss the food in. When he was finished it looked like he just put it back on the counter to be used again!!! Really?!? It made me sick to my stomach!! I got the honey walnut shrimp which was good but left a weird film in my mouth and had a very strange sourish \""sauce\"" in the bottom of the to go box. I probably will not be returning to this location."
0,"Best word to describe it: gross. You honestly get what you pay for. Unfortunately we came with a big group and someone else booked the hotel. There were much better places for slightly more for the same nights. The casino lobby smelled horrible- like rancid beer. The carpets were all stained, and looked they have never been cleaned. The rooms are outdated, and the bathroom disgusting."
0,"Pizza was mushy , not like ninja turtle awesome mushy but rather ack thats all slippy slide in my moth hole  - taste was ok, topping seemed solid. but it was most def on my \""stay away buy open late, list\"" I Could do this maybe drunk at 2am, NOW the WINGS - NO NO NO , the WORST ever, being form buffalo; and i take them pretty serious. but OK. IM in love with wings, just need to get my fix.\n\n They arrived box swamped with grease in and sadly out , had to put towels just to open, upon opening .... They looked ok overall ... BUT one single bite  - - - BURNT  never changed grease flavor (that deep absolute, stuck in the mouth for nights , absolutely appalling taste. Tried with the ranch (had no blue cheese offered ever for extra) just burnt grease flavor. Let me tell you, I cant get any from that taste outta my mouth or brain  ... its so off that it almost ruined by favorite food for life. 24 or so wings in the trash and im not even kidding but saying my pups wouldn't even eat more then or  bite or so  after. Id rather Gordan Ramsey take every bad thing in the cooler or the worst show and put in my mouth in puree form.\n\nGuessing from the overall (all)  the grease has not been changed in several months. Not night or days, just not changed and all the wing blood and burned fry, is most apparent within. I hope its a bad night for them a few weeks ago. I like they are open uber later and can if needed deliver but - no way man, stay away."
0,"This meal only reminded me why we had not been here in so long. A half pound guacamole burger ordered medium with cheese was served well-done with brown guacamole and a limp piece of cheese that was still cold.  Server offered to re fire but we were in a hurry. . The. Turkey club had 2 thin slices of Turkey and 2 pieces of bacon. The there was more lettuce and tomato than meat. . The only good thing is they still serve great steak Frys, thick and crisp. . Guess we'll stay away another year or so."
1,"AMAZING crepes. Great service. Went on a weekday and we got there around 10am right before their rush. We got free green tea cake while we waited for our food. I got the pick me up (coffee crepe). It was SOO yummy! I felt like I was eating a piece of heaven. Then, afterward they gave us complimentary cookies and milk in a real 50 mL beaker! Definitely would go back."
0,First of all came here for brunch and it was over priced!! Everything I wanted on the menu  they did not have plus the food was under cooked.. The waiter George tried his best and very positive he was the best Server in this place as far as the rest of the service terrible!! The bartenders never asked us if we would like more drinks i also experienced another group asking them for help. Whn she only showed attention to one group being that there was only 3 groups in the place. George again was what customer service is made the rest of the staff terrible and rude just like their food
1,"Looks are definitely deceiving here.  Doesn't look like much outside, or inside.  Very small and cramped.  They might think about removing the booths to open up the space.  I came on a Monday night, and the place was packed; which says a lot.  I was finally seated, but quickly grew annoyed because it seemed the waiter forgot about me while waiting on others that had sat down after me.  Nevertheless, I finally ordered some chicken panang.  I was in for a feast.  The portion was huge, and I can eat a lot in one sitting!  Very rich with coconut milk and red curry.  I ordered a level 10 spiciness, but it came out as a 2.  Obviously \""white-washed.\""  The flavor was outstanding however.  I think I need to become somewhat of a regular, so they know I'm not messing around when I say, \""make it spicy!\"""
1,"So we have been driving by the one on Rainbow in southwest for about a year now and saw this newly opened gem while we were getting our pictures taken near by. While we waited for the pictures to print, we decided to try this place. The food was pretty good and the service was fantastic. Definitely  worth a visit."
0,"Today I had gone to this t mobile store to buy a new phone because I had just cracked mine. When I entered the store no one greeted me and there were two cashiers and another gentlemen in the back that kept coming out every so often. Originally there were only 3 customers including myself and 3 workers which made sense that I wouldn't be waiting to long to get my new phone. I got in line behind a person who was already in the middle of his transaction thinking it wouldn't be long while I got attended to. I kid you not 6 people walked in, in the course of me standing behind this one guy and no one offered to help me. I asked one lady and she told me rudely to hold on. Not till I almost walked out did another lady ask to help me. When I finally got her to grab what I needed she seemed careless and never acknowledged me because she was to busy conversing with her fellow coworkers. I was never so offended to not being helped. They had no professionalism nor common curtesy. Never again will I step foot at this tmoblie store. Almost made me want to cancel my phone."
1,"I must say it is tough to get a 5 out of me.  This place however  does it.\n\nStarting off, the outside and inside of the burger restaurant was carefully crafted. Colors are done right.  Has a style if it's own.\nOrdering is straight forward.\nBurger  -  Drink and sides.\nCost though I  just think was a bit high, but in the end so worth it.\nMy first time here so I went basic with a little chip crunch on top.\nSolid Dark Chocolate Milk Shake and the mix of sweet potato fries and regular fries.\n\nI will start with he fries.  Delectable dish and I had the dijon and horseradish sauce.  Spectacular!\nThe dark chocolate milkshake was a proverbial happy punch to the stomach that was so good, I wanted more.. Smooth and not overly chocolate.  Just the right amount.\n\nNow the burger, I do love burgers and I have to shout out that the best one I have ever had is at the El Corral in Bogata Colombia.  The beef standards there are so much different and better.  However, BBP does a stellar job of setting the Angus beef standard  there and giving us good quality beef."
1,I've been going to this place for years and have always enjoyed their chicken tacos/ tortas and chili relleno burritos! The people that work there are very nice and speak English well (a total plus for a coconut like me!).
1,"Ate here for the first time this morning at 11:15 a.m.  As A.B. guessed, they are primarily a catering gig.  There were only two other parties there. The family ordered off of the menu--eggs Benedict, patty melt, and 2 your way.  I ordered the skillet, as advertised on the window.\n\nI've eaten at most of the breakfast joints around town. Add this place to the list of good ones. Potatoes and eggs were perfect, the portions are huge, and everything came out about the same time. Service is attentive, and friendly.  Check out the pics of the Benedict and skillet--we'll be eating this for tomorrow's breakfast!"
0,Alamo is f****** stupid.  I booked a car for Las Vegas to drive back home. But they only accept major credit cards for dropping off at another location.  And because I didn't check THEIR debit card policy on THEIR website (booked through Expedia) they just kept saying I should have looked at their website or I should've booked directly with them.  Well shouldn't you make sure your third party booking sites are giving people all relevant information.  Now I'm in line somewhere else because I didn't bring any of my credit cards.  What a complete waste of my time on my super short trip.  And thanks Alamo employees for standing there and being completely incompetent and pretty much telling me it's my fault for booking through a through Expedia.  You suck.  You too Expedia.
1,"What a great and interesting meal!\n\nIn town for business and looking at CC's menu, I was intrigued when I saw Wild Boar  Meatballs.   Starting with drinks, they have an amazing mixologist behind the bar.  I went for a drink called Viva based on the waitress' recommendation.    This was a very refreshing, strawberry based drink with different herbs and fresh ingredients.  They also have an incredible wine list ranging from an inexpensive bottle up to $1500 + bottle of vintage.\n\nWe decided on the small plates menu as it was late and also there were a great deal of interesting items in this area.  The thing that impresses me so about this restaurant is the interesting combinations the Chef brings together.\n\nTo start. the Stetson Chopped Salad is an absolute must!  The waitress brings out this perfectly arranged aligned plate of chopped lettuce, chopped smoked salmon, trail mix, cous cous, and corn.  She mixed this all up with their amazing dressing and served the two portions.  It was an amazing explosion of different tastes and textures ranging from smoky salmon to sweet little raisins from the trail mix.  I could eat this every day!\n\nFor small plates; we went with the Burrata with Avocado and olive oil which was  a very tasty combination and a great start.  From there we went with the Wild Boar meatball which was although this was what brought me here, it was my least favorite dish.   Next we had the most amazing and interesting dish of the night, Pork Belly served on a toasted pumpkin bread.  This was absolutely amazing!  The salty and fatty pork belly was so perfectly matched with the sweet crunchy pumpkin bread.  I cant stress enough how amazing this was!  Our last plate was the Tiger Shrimp with corn and bacon.  The shrimp was perfectly grilled, the corn mixed with bacon was a great addition to the dish.\n\nWe were to full for dessert however all looked amazing including a dish that had ice cream made with duck fat. Cmon, really!\n\nA must next time I'm in Scottsdale again or maybe this is the reason to come to Scottsdale."
0,"This buffet is hit or miss and it figures that the time I decide to review it, the place had a very off day, including giving me a mild case of food poisoning again. Usually, the fried chicken, if available, is the top attraction, due to its crispyness and moist meat. On this day, which was a Monday afternoon, I had rotiserre chicken breast which was the best offering. Nothing else actually looked or tasted good. Mole chicken sounded great and on my initial walkthrough, that is why I purchased the buffet. Too bad, that this mole had no relation to real Mexican mole and the entire dish was too dryed out. Stffed cabbage was a horror show and the taco meat section was one giant pool of grease. Mongolian BBQ was also tried, but they don't put any sauce on it when they cook it, so it tastes just like, well nothing. The Chile Relleno was possibly the worst looking thing ever and didn't taste much better either. Deserts needed some work as well, but the butter pecan custard (they said it was) was decent, although could have been the culprit also to my later problems. You know what bothered me also was that there is a Guy cooking back there and anytimne anybody spills something (like some corn, etc) he is all over it, taking his nasty over the shoulder towel and dabbing it up. I'm all for a clean buffet, but find something else to do for a few minutes besides clean up every piece of corn that falls out of a laddling spoon. Maybe think of a better recipe to have us eat. Call ahead and if the fried  chicken is available for dinner, it is worth the $8.99 itself with a few side dishes that are usually better than this lunch, which would include potatoes. Oh, the rice was excellent."
0,"Don't give this place your business!!! Buying my wedding dress was supposed to be a special & memorable experience. Instead, I was treated like crap, ignored, and even hung up on by the owner!! My dress came in missing accessories, and when I asked when I can expect the missing pieces to be delivered, he gave me a deep sigh, rolled his eyes, and said \""I'll let you know!\""  All in all, the entire experience was a nightmare, and the staff was rude & extremely unprofessional. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy."
1,"My one (and likely only) experience at The Arrogant Butcher was for happy hour, and it was one of the best mixes of food, drink, and value I have ever had. My friend and I were in town for a WWE event at the US Airways Arena, and decided to stop in here for food and drinks beforehand. We took a spot at the bar and was pleased to see a great selection of Happy Hour specials - both food and drink.\n\nWe ordered the house soft pretzels with cheese dip ($5) and the Antipasti plate ($8) to share, and each ordered one of their toasts ($4) - my friend went with the roasted peppers and boursin cheese, and I opted for the chicken liver pate. The soft pretzel order was HUGE - I've seen portions half the size for much more at brewpubs - and were DELICIOUS. The toasts were a nice surprise - ample portions, and great quality ingredients. The chicken liver pate was divine - so smooth and creamy. The Antipasti plate provided an ample portion of meats and cheeses, all great quality. At $11/person, we were happily stuffed with bar munchies of the highest caliber.\n\nBeer selection here is limited, but they do offer some decent options. Guinness, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, an IPA from Deschutes, and their local selection was the famous Four Peaks Kilt Lifter, that seemed to be everywhere I went in Phoenix. (They also had a Hefeweizen, but I don't remember where from.) At $3 for the local brew and $4 for the others, this is a great Happy Hour option. \n\nI'd love to try them for dinner, but I can't imagine when/if I will be in Phoenix again. For happy hour, I give them my highest of recommendations."
1,"STA Travel was my automatic go to place for travel advice when I decided to go on a trip to South America a while ago. I think this was partly because I'd been bombarded with STA Travel banter while I was at university, with it being a travel agent specialising in youth and student travel and all that jazz. The idea of a round the world ticket has been my prospective get out of being an adult option for ages, and I am not lying when I say that I think about walking into STA Travel and just booking said ticket and leaving a farewell note on the kitchen table, everytime I pass its doors.\n\nWhen I finally figure out how to save money, I'll be legging it straight down here for the golden ticket to recklessness and sunshine, but for now, a couple of trips abroad, for a few months at a time after I finished uni, have done the job. The staff at this branch of STA were super helpful at assisting me with both of these trips, and seeing as they're all pretty young, and have done a substantial amount of travelling themselves, it's quite an inspiring place to come and get advice from people you can relate to, if you're young that is. I have just edged out of the \""Youth\"" category, (*holds back the tears and the wrinkles*) but there are still some good flight deals and information to be had from the staff here, even if I am no longer classed as young."
1,"The food here was really good. We were pleasantly surprised. I would recommend the Kare Kare, Bicol Express, Oxtail Soup, Fried Rice, and Lechon.  We also ordered the Sisig and Palabok. I was really looking forward to the sisig but it tasted fishy and it didn't appeal to the entire group. The Palabok was okay too.  Overall we were pleasantly surprised with how good the food tasted. Although the Kare Kare was really good, it was greasy and the portion was small for the price. The Lechon was delicious as well as the fried rice. I've never had Bicol express and we all liked it.\n\nThe service was also nice. He was very attentive and refilled our drinks even without us having to flag him down.  We would definitely go here again if we want filipino food."

The price on the page was \nCraftsman Professional Height Adjustable Clamping Table\nReconditioned Item # 65796  |  Model # 65796\n(24 Reviews) $31.93 - $51.93   Reg Price $79.99 Up to 60% OFF \nThis product is eligible for Store pickup\n\nNOTE: This item is eligible for store pickup, so I tried to order 2 and the price jumped to $79.99 each for a store pickup!.  I was interrupted by a Chat popup, so I asked Elaine for help. Her first reply was \""Might be tax\"" and then she suggested I try the help line totally ignoring my \""How did the price go from $31.93 to $79.99\"". Needless to say, I recognized the \""Bail & Switch\"" and I backed out of the order."
0,"Love the decor and the atmosphere is fun. Definitely not a date spot, better for a group. The food is just ok, barely. Do not come here expecting memorable food. Drinks / wine are pricey as well. Unfortunately it is probably your best bet for dining in the Music Factory area."
0,"This place is big nasty.  NASTY!  Perkins isn't much better.  Just go to any of the downtown Champaign bars, most of them serve food until pretty late and you won't get food poisoning - big plus!"
1,"Amazing East Coast food! I am a Boston girl, and always on the search for good food from home. This place is the real deal! The people are friendly and food is reasonably priced. We have tried several things on the menu and it is all amazing! By far our favorite place to eat in all of Las Vegas and Henderson!"
1,"Our flight was on time! That right there is enough to give any airport at least 3 stars. On top of that, we ran into no problems with anything! Even the TSA agents were friendly, which is totally unusual yet very much appreciated! There's not much as far as food is concerned if you go in the morning; make sure you aren't even the slightest bit hungry before going because there's nothing really to eat. Both my dog and I had a positive experience. Way to go, Phoenix!"
1,"The BBT is by far the best bar in the Southside!  A bit off the beaten path, but the selection of food, craft beers, and great wait staff make me want to stay and hang out for hours!!  Definitely the neighborhood bar to be at! Love this place!"
0,"Talk about weak sauce. This place has dry. Dri. Drei. Dryyyyyy Pulled pork!  And drowning it in their boring sauce does not help things. In fact, given that they use seemingly store bought hamburger buns, drowning it in sauce makes it nearly impossible to eat.  Very sad pulled pork sandwich."
1,"Came here the other night with a $30 for $60 Groupon.  I have to admit, my expectations were lowered after reading several of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nFirst the d\u00e9cor.  It was nice, a little too dark for me, but overall I liked the feel of the place.  We sat in a high-back booth in the bar area that felt very private.  Even the bathrooms were well kept and modern-looking.\n\nThe service was also very good.  Our server, Shay, took great care of us.  She was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and kept our water and tea filled all night without us asking once.  Our food came out quickly and the billing process was also fast.\n\nThe food was good but not great.  They have a decent kids menu for $6.95 and my boys got the bbq ribs and mac and cheese.  First the ribs, tender, well seasoned, and a generous portion (5 or 6 bones).  The only problem was the sauce was a little spicy, especially for kids, so my son ended up eating my wife's food instead.  The mac and cheese was average.\n\nMy wife and I shared a wedge salad to start and it was the typical wedge, iceberg, blue cheese, bacon and tomatoes but it was good and fairly priced at $5.50\n\nMy wife went with the maui ribeye (marinated in soy and pineapple juice).  It was well seasoned and served with a loaded baked potato.  She ordered it medium but it came out closer to mid well-well done.  The meat was still flavorful and tender so we didn't send it back.  The baked potato was perfectly cooked and had enough flavor that no S&P was needed.\n\nI got several of the appetizers for my entr\u00e9e (potato fritters, beef carpacchio, and mesquite grilled shrimp).  The potato fritters were good, basically fried balls of loaded baked potatoes served with a semi spicy remoulade.  The beef was okay, needed a little more dressing on the arugula and seasoning on the beef.  The shrimp was the most disappointing, 4 grilled shrimp with little flavor and some sort of onion slaw that didn't go well with the shrimp.  I found myself dipping the shrimp in the potato remoulade and it was much better.\n\nThe place was a little pricey but the groupon made it a more than fair deal.  I would go back to try some other items but probably order any meat a temperature less than I normally would."
0,Maybe I was there at the wrong time. Maybe the cook had a bad night. Drove past this place so many times over the years and never stopped. The lack of flavor made me wish I had kept going. Had a #4 Philly w/ provolone and side of chili fries. It was all bland. Wish I could have had one of the great Philly's I read about in the other reviews but not so lucky.
1,"I've been following one of the employees here for years.  BJ is an absolute artist.  If you are considering injectables of any kind, this is the only place as far as I'm concerned.\n\nThere's a large assortment of laser treatments, products, facials, etc with very well trained staff."
1,"I have many pictures of my four legged kids, most not very good as I can never get them to sit still long enough to capture the 'who' it is that they are.  Christmas of last year, I decided I needed professional assistance and contacted Michelle Pelberg of Cow Dreamz  Photography, (602) 510-1929.  Michelle will meet prospective clients in most any setting as it is her mission to photograph pets relaxed and in their element.  We decided on a local park and met in the afternoon.  Like all great photographers, Michelle snapped away, remaining inconspicuous as my dogs enjoyed a winter day in the great out doors.\n\nI will utilize Michelle in any future pet photography project and happily endorse her services to all interested parties.  She has a knack for capturing the essence of our beloved four legged kids."
0,The salads looked like it was directly out of a bag. The service was lacking in an almost empty restaurant. My girlfriends Shrimp Scampi was good but the Maryland Crab cakes weren't. \nYou know it's bad when you walk out see Panda Express and know you would have had a better experience there.
0,"Boy was I deceived!\n\nI've come here with my bf 3 different times this week and every single time we've walked in and out immediately because it was SOO DEAD. The days we went were Sunday, Saturday, and Wednesday. The last time I came here was on a Friday and I'm guessing that's their only busy day of the entire week. It was seriously DEAD every other time that we went, no more than 3 groups of people, so sad. I really wanted to come on a Saturday night since THEIR FLYER says that they have belly dancers. When we came in and saw nothing but an empty room my bf asked the manager about the dancers and he said \""oh, thats on Thursday.\"" Their flyer says nothing about dancers on Thursday...\n\nI really loved this place the first time we went and I thought it'd be like that every night, but boy was I wrong! \n\nDon't come here on any day other than Friday."
0,"My first time eating at a Five Guys, and I do not understand where all the rave is about. I was really disappointed with my burger. The service could not be worst! It took them 5 minutes to realized that my food had not been given to me. I was given the wrong order. I am very picky about my burger. \n\nThe staff is unfortunately clueless, and not highly motivated. They rather make jokes between them, the assist customers."
1,"These street style tacos are delicious! The pastor with pineapple and carne asada w/ guac and handmade tortillas are my favorite. They have a little bar area and a set up for a lounge type at night, but I have only been there for lunch. The setup is a bit confusing since you have to go to different stations depending on what type of taco you want, but the staff is helpful. I think tuesdays they have taco specials."
0,Not that authentic. Taqueria Guadalajara is much better tasting and has similar menu.
0,"First let me say I did end up joining as a member. Its a convenient location, nice, new and not very busy so it makes for a good experience. \n\nI am also a member of Scottsdale Gun Club and shoot there as well. \n\nAlthough C2 is newer and brighter there are a few things that keep Scottsdale as my #1 range. \n\nFirst C2 requires you buy their targets - not a huge deal but I am not a big fan of their big targets and don't really like not having a cardboard backer - but its a minor issue. \n\nSecond, C2 doesn't seem to want to let shooters do anything but shoot at stationary targets from the ready positon. Scottsdale will allow tactical positions and draw from holster once you pass their requirements (class or test with a staffer). That makes for a better shooting experience if you are a regular shooter that carries daily and wants to maintain proficiency in drawing and firing. \n\nLastly - ammo prices. I don't understand C2's strategy on ammo pricing at all. \n\nA range is usually the least expensive place to buy ammo. Ranges want you to shoot and shoot a lot and their business model requires that. Scottsdale Gun Club ammo (for range use) is MUCH cheaper than any retail shop (particularly for members). C2 is the exact opposite - ammo prices are at least 40% over what you can buy it for at retail shops in the area (although availability is  bit of a problem at retail stores - ammo can be purchased at reasonable prices if you shop around and do a bit of legwork). \n\nHere are some examples of member pricing. \n\n5.56 - 20 round boxes are currently $19.99 at C2 \n$9.89 at Scottsdale \n40S&W is $20.99 at C2 \n$17.99 at Scottsdale\n9MM $19.99 at C2 \n$13.97 at Scottsdale\n\nNot a huge deal if you shoot a box a month - but me and my friends shoot 5-10 boxes each a week. If you are a regular shooter thus likely a member - the pricing difference is substantial. \n\nFor location, looks etc. 5 stars, ammo pricing 1 star so 3 star average.\n\nUPDATE\n\nSo I been back another half dozen times and really like the staff and the range is just killer. My wife likes how bright it is and the benches in the range area are nice! But C2 keeps doing it wrong on pricing. Since my post ammo prices at C2 have gone UP, considerably, 40S&W is now over $30 a box, 9mm reloads? (in ziploc bags) are $25 while at the same time stock has been resupplied at local retailers and prices have plummeted.\n\nIn addition I was in the market for a new carry pistol and really wanted an M&P Shield in 40 S&W, C2 had one for $529. That seemed high to me so I drove up to Scottsdale and got the same gun for $449. \n\nLove to shoot here - but would never buy anything other than the mandatory targets. So because of the obscene ammo and gun prices I gotta drop to a 2 star rating 5 for appearance 0 for pricing."
0,"Um. It's okay, I guess. They have food at decent prices, but the isles are narrow, everything needs a good cleaning and repainting, and it just felt dark and depressing. Otherwise it's all right, but I don't plan on returning here."
0,"I have ordered plenty of times from this company approximately 14 times... It is really convenient, maybe not the best quality but very convenient. \nEvery time they would get something wrong such as: forget the beverages, COLD food, chicken instead of shrimp, MISSING appetizer, MISSING entree and forget the condiments - on all different occasions (I am very particular with what I want - I distinctly specify that, and not assume that it will comes with it, and basing on their mistakes in the past- yet it still happens again and again). Yet, I have been very patient and understanding. \nWhat gets me is that they do not own up to their mistakes, they always blame the restaurant, when I had called the restaurant 3 occasions, it was clear that it was RoadRunner's mishap on how they placed the order and the food should be checked before leaving right??!? \nThe Delivery people are VERY nice (Personally I have worked in the hospitality industry for so long, that I understand that mistakes can happen and I have ALWAYS been understanding). \nOne day, I decided to order from them and I used the same credit card that I have used in most of my transactions (Yes, it was my mishap that I had misplaced my wallet) the delivery guy and the order takers were very nice, wanting to help me... But the manager stated that it is on the 15th transaction that they need not to see the credit card/ID. (I am one transaction away from this?!?!) \nWell they didn't give me food and I was upset and extremely HUNGRY but I wasn't mad! I understood that it was my mistake.\n\nSo days later I called to verify 2 things: credit to my bank for the food that was delivered but not given and a $6.++ credit for a previous order that they messed up (and PROMISED to credit back - but never did 3 transactions from the last time I ordered) and the order takers (very nice) stated that they will forward this issue with the manager. Bottom line is  - i called 4 times, left my information, it took 15 weeks before I got a hold of the manager/owner KAREN (did I mention that I was the one who called) \nFirst, for an business owner she was very unprofessional - stating that because that I did not get the previous order she could not give me my $6++ credit. That credit was from a past mistake that they had made. First of all I am not money hungry! I just firmly believed that it was their mistake so that's why I deserved that credit. Secondly, she threatened to hangup with me because she was very busy and had no time to deal with my call. How professional was that? She yelled at me and stated that she would send the money in the mail to which she did. I don't feel I was handled right. Honestly felt extremely insulted. I am hoping that from this experience they would learn how to properly communicate with their clientele and how to run an effective business."
0,"My fianc\u00e9 and I decided to dine at the Capital Grill for a special anniversary.  This was our first time at the restaurant, and we left with a lack luster impression.  The service was subpar at best.  After being seated, we waited for a good 5-10 minutes before being greeted.  Our table was partially set, and we needed to ask for napkins halfway through our first course.\nOur waitress was far from attentive, and it was obvious she did not want to be working.  After mildly checking from across the way on how our dinner was, she quickly rushed to take our dessert order and our bill was on the table before dessert even came out.\nWhile we can usually overlook bad service for good food, there wasn't much to be desired when it came to taste and presentation. \nWe both ordered a Caesar salad, which I've seen plated more appealingly at you local pub.  At $10 a salad, I guess we just expected to see more than a plate half scattered with lettuce and 2 croutons.\nMy fianc\u00e9 had a steak, which he did say was delicious, and we split a nice batch of their truffle fries.  I got their vegetarian pasta, it was ok - lacked flavor, but I recognized it was a steak house and pasta isn't a speciality.\nMaybe it was an off night for the kitchen and staff - regardless - we won't be rushing back or recommending it to anyone."
0,Nice little place with great music and ambiance. Kitchen was already closed so we didn't have a chance to try out the food which may never happen now. Our server was just plain horrible. You could tell she didn't want to be there and was just going through the motions. Most of her time was spent sitting at the bar or conversating with some obvious regulars. When she did make an appearance she was rude and short. The place is really close to home and would've been a nice place to stop by after a long day but if I want rude obnoxious service I'll go to the dive bar down the street that charges half the price.
0,"So, last Saturday, my friends and I flew out to Vegas to have some fun and decided on The Cosmopolitan for our first night out.  A very mixed experience!  First we headed over to STK where we had dinner and then decided to have a drink at the bar but quickly decided to go elsewhere because the 2 ladies behind the bar were rude.\n\nWe made our way over to Vesper.  Wow!  So much talent with a friendly welcome.  The drink was so good and I highly recommend it!\n\nNow comes to our final destination: The Chandelier Bar.  We settled in to the second floor but not for long.  We sat next to the service station and notice something disgusting.  A drink was sitting there with the drink ticket INSIDE THE DRINK.  YUCK!  I took a picture and posted it here on Yelp.  Needless to say, I would never go back to Chandelier.  And it kind of makes me wonder what else happens behind the scenes at the other venues."
0,"What a let down!\n\nThe interior of the restaurant looks dingy and our service was good but our waitress was bizarre.  I had friends meet me there after being stood up.  Didn't really like being asked about it.  I don't think she was rude or anything but she was clearly just a kooky kind of girl who make sure everyone in the dining room knew she was great friends with her co worker Ed. So I guess it's good that the staff gets along!\n\nThe bean dip was excellent but the strip steaks were pure gristle, order the crab cakes.\n\nI don't think I'll be coming back here but this place seems popular and everyone I know loves the food so I can only assume I was there on an off night."
1,"We came here for Valentine's Day dinner, ready for some tasty AYCE after hearing good things about this new sushi place on Decatur near Twain.  Looking over the menu, I was so happy to see that they offered my favorite, the Lion Roll, which I've only found at one other sushi place in Henderson.  It turns out that the chefs at Jjanga (not that game Jenga) used to work at that Hendo joint, so now I don't have to go all that way to get my fix.  This place is new and was not that busy, which was just fine with us on this Hallmark holiday-no waiting for a table.  Very nice modern decor with wood accenting and quite roomy, this place doesn't feel like your traditional sushi restaurant.  Jung, our waiter du jour, was very friendly and attentive, making sure he answered any questions we had and kept the food and drinks coming.\nIn addition to the Lion Roll, I liked the pumpkin soup, the Johnny Roll, and dessert, of course. Jjanga had a  Valentine's Day special: fried banana with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce, a sweet ending to a great V Day meal. Jung even took our  picture with some new-fangled Polaroid type camera so they could hang our photo on one of the walls, posted with those of other customers. We got one to keep, as well. After such an enjoyable and filling meal, we know that we shall return."
0,"Maybe it's because my friends and I were there earlier in the night, the place was filled with an older crowd, and wasn't full. We came here to get a stamp to get into XS for free which turned out to be a bust, but that's alright. The music was what you get anywhere you go. A mix of top 40 and house. The drinks were watered down but I guess you can't really complain when they're free. \n\nThe main reason for the low rating is because I could not get over the fact that the entire place smelled DISGUSTING! There is a problem when the bathroom of a place smells better than the actual place."
1,"i'm a regular here.. the ladies are always very friendly..\n\nit's clean and very comfortable.  the decor isn't overbearing and it's quiet.  \n\neach time i get up to get my hands done, someone is coming and cleaning the foot tub with clorox which is a good.  \n\nthey take their time and never rush.  \nlove the service here!  they're awesome."
1,"I read great things about this restaurant, so I had to try it. I made a reservation on Opentable and was seated upon arrival. The day that I went was raining so seating on the patio was not available. I went during lunch time, so the restaurant wasn't too full.\n\nOverall, I had a pleasant time. My waitress was really nice and took care of me since I was eating by myself. I loved the warm french bread. It was too much for me to eat in one sitting, so I took the leftovers back home. \n\nI ordered the trout with green beans and almonds. The trout was great and was cooked well. It was a bit strange that the waitress asked if it was okay that the fish has skin. Maybe people don't eat fish with skin on? \n\nAs for dessert, I had the white chocolate butterscotch bread pudding. It was a recommendation from the waitress, and it was very good. The bread pudding wasn't overly sweet, especially with the butterscotch at the bottom of the bread pudding. I enjoyed it. \n\nTake a walk after your meal since you will be stuffed!"
0,Nearly all of the staff seemed incompetent and slow. Had to walk out of the cafe because we didn't get service. Our room service order was completely screwed up and they never fixed it. The trash in the hallways hasn't been picked up for days. Nobody was at the gift shop or the spa.
0,"After wanting to get some good quality viet food but being to lazy to drive to China town, my wife and I decided to check this place out. First impression was ugly decor, poor ventilation, and the fruits in the storage looked like they were rotting. But that has never stopped me from eating good quality food, so we went ahead and sat down. My wife was happy when she they had a young coconut drink. Saw the dude pull it out of the rotting fruit section. I tried it and felt it was disgusting, my wife said it was good. Egg rolls were terrible, and I ordered the special combination vermicelli and my wife ordered the egg roll vermicelli. Long story short food was bland and not worth the price. I highly doubt we will ever visit this establishment again."
0,Drinks where good. Food came out cold. We left and went somewhere else this was a bust..
1,"I will have to update because I only stopped in for a quick treat. While walking by Sunday morning, there was a sign outside mentioning cinnamon rolls & pecan rolls.. say no more! I was actually craving a donut an entire 30 seconds before seeing that sign, so it worked out great. I wanted to take a picture of the pecan roll that i ordered, but it was so delicious I took my first bite while walking out the door. It was seriously delicious- a large, flakey cinnamon roll with a sweet glaze and topped with pecans!\n\nI will eventually update and get a meal here sometime."
0,"I'm not really a big fan of the BX... I mean, AAFES a nice option to have, but i feel like everything is limited. I can never find anything that i'm looking for and always end up at Walmart or best buy instead. Shopping there for electronics is the worst, but if you need something like an everyday necessity (deodorant, soap, shampoo, etc etc), you can definitely find it here for the most part. The rug store has some decent rugs, but its all too pricey for me. My husband has been into Gamestop a few times before but always walks out empty handed... that doesn't happen often, so i really shouldn't complain ;) On a positive note, they do have little food court so if you ever get hungry, you could stop there, but i'll be honest... it almost feels like a high school cafeteria."
1,"Came here with the girlies but we weren't that hungry so we just ordered a couple of appetizers and a pizza to share. We made reservations the day of. The service and staff were very prompt, friendly, and helpful. We kept asking our waiter about portion size, and he told us that there were only 4 crab cakes, but he was gonna hook us up with 5, since we had 5 girlies in our group. We ordered the following:\n\n1. Crispy Fried Calamari, Cucumber Slaw, Lemon, Gremolata Aioli\n2. Saut\u00e9ed Maine Crab Cakes, Tomato Relish, Basil Aioli\n3. Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers, Creamy Celery Salad, House Steak Sauce\n4. Pizza: Italian Sausage, Roasted Peppers, Mushrooms, Smoked Ricotta, Onions, Parsley\n\nSurprisingly that filled us up and we were very satisfied."
1,"I have ordered from the location at least 3 times. The staff is friendly, the pizza is fresh & hot and the salads are piled with all the right stuff. They always get my order correct, including light sauce. It's affordable and fast. I usually prefer them over, Pizza Hut & Dominos."
0,"This place is your typical Chinese fast food. I didn't find them friendly at all. I ordered the shrimp chow funn. I asked for no brown sauce, and it came with brown sauce. The portion were chincy for something that cost $8. It tasted okay, nothing special.  I haven't been back since.\n\nChina A GoGo is a NO NO."
1,"It was my first time coming to this place today. Came during my lunch hour, I was surprised it wasnt full of people! Service was good, very nice cashier upfront (I believe her name was Jamie). I ordered the original double cheese n fries. Omgggg! It was delicious! I saw the burger and thought I wouldnt get full lol but its actually the perfect size. I wasnt over stuffed when done and was very satisfying. The burger was a little greasy but sooooooo delicious! The fries... I wasnt a big fan; dont get me wrong, they are good but they are really thin so they are a little on the crispier side. Im not a fan of crispy foods. I would highly recommend this place!"
1,"This bike shop is perfect for someone like me. A daily bike commuter in Montreal especially in the areas around the mountain and sometimes through the mountain.\n\nIt's by a main bike path in the Plateau area of Montreal. They have a free air pump outside the shop. They are very, very busy during biking season so servicing can take longer than the usual 'within 24 hours' but that's normal. They are friendly and they do a heck of a job tuning up a bike.\n\nI bought a second hand Giant last year and never did a tune up until this summer after using the bike daily even during the winter except for the coldest and snowiest days. My bike was pretty good and was very reliable but after having it serviced by this shop I feel like I have a brand new bike and has made my daily commute so much more enjoyable!!\n\nThanks to James for being really cool and for having a great staff."
0,"From the way I saw it, if you want to have fun at Tryst, you had best be poppin' bottles. Otherwise, get used to hearing the phrases \""you can't stand here\"" and \""keep it moving,\"" because there is about an inch of space for every five people who aren't getting bottle service, and seemingly no where you are allowed to actually stand. The music was all boom-chicka boom-chicka with no lyrics or anything familiar. I know some people dig that but I like more variety. The main bar was pretty small and hella packed, and located inconveniently in one of the main aisles that you weren't supposed to stand around. Do most people just get frustrated and succumb to bottle service in defeat? And finally, was it just me or was it kind of icky-smelling in there? \n\nI could have stuck around to find the answers to these questions and more but in all honestly I wasn't really feeling well that night, anyway. I gladly sacrificed my night at Tryst for some quality time with my pillow. And you best be believin' I made up for lost time the following night."
1,"Most people don't have a good time at this club. I could tell by the line-up of around 800 people on Halloween night. However, for my buddy (who looks just like Ryan Phillipe) and I, it was a seriously slick night. We got in with no waiting in line and didn't pay any cover.\n\nThe inside of Studio 54 is nothing short of completely mindnumbing. The place is huge, offers ridiculous effects and lighting, and provides live entertainment from their excellent line-up of beautiful dancers (both male and female). The drinks here are over-priced, but that's something you have to live with. The place is legendary.\n\nSure, I didn't Mike Meyers there, but the place spanked of taste and the perfect club atmosphere. Even without cocaine, I felt like I was ripped anyways.\n\nStudio 54 is beautiful. It's exclusive. And the whole world wants to be in there."
1,"While the rest of our friends were getting ready to go clubbing later that night, a couple of my buddies and I decided to grab some burgers before going bar hopping around Fremont Street.  I originally wanted to check out Holstein's after seeing them on our last Vegas trip, but there wasn't an opportunity to go since we had already planned out the rest of our meals.  After I read Yelp friend Cat C.'s review though, I told my friends it was a must for our next trip!\n\nAlthough some Yelpers have complained about how long the wait was for a table, we didn't run into the same problem.  Luck must have been on our side because not only did it take just a few minutes until we were seated, but we also got a server (Jennifer?) who was both awesome and way cute.  Double win!  A bunch of the burgers on the menu sounded pretty appealing (especially The Rising Sun, The Steakhouse, and Korean \""Bull\""gogi), but somehow the three of us managed to order the exact same thing - the Gold Standard (Dry Aged Beef Sirloin with Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula, and Garlic Chive Aioli) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=vErdAOwPAfm6PP_uFDmjEQ).\n\nThe patty was cooked perfectly - just a touch of pink on the inside, juicy, and a light char on the outside.  Adding in the smoked bacon just made it that much better (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=t6cDviH3qCnh95L9pnFaVA).  While all of the condiments worked really well together, I have to admit all that aged goat cheddar got to be a bit much.  Not bad for the first half of the burger, but I was reminded during the last half why I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese.  We all agreed though that the biggest knock was the bun - a bit dry and pretty plain.  Just making it smaller and less airy would have gone a long way.\n\nAll things considered, the prices for their burgers aren't unreasonable.  At about $13-$18 each, you actually get your money's worth for the most part (unlike China Poblano next door...).  Whichever one you get though, I'd suggest choosing the shoestring fries to go with it (they're more like regular cut fries than \""shoestring\"").  While the tin of steak fries that came with my order were fine, I thought the shoestring fries my friend had were crispier and a little more flavorful.  Now I just have to go back and try one of Holstein's shakes - preferably of the alcoholic variety."
1,This place is great! Today I had the west coast sandwich and it was amazing. One of the best sandwiches in the area. The chicken is perfect for the sandwich. And the waffle as bread is a cool idea. My girlfriend and I normally go in here for smoothies and this was the first time I ate food and I was not disappointed. The smoothies are really good as well the first time I had a smoothie with tofu I didn't think I would like it because of the tofu but it gets better ever time! Would  totally recommend this place to others!
1,"My husband and I love to brunch at Rachel's Kitchen on the weekends. Not only did they expand and have tons of seating now, but they also have an awesome outdoor seating area and live music on the weekends. It is a great little hang out place in the spring and fall when the weather is perfect. Now, on to the important stuff...\n\nThe blueberry pancakes are my personal favorite and they come with a side of fresh fruit. My current addiction is the Wilshire smoothie. Their smoothies are a bit runnier and more juice-like than other places, but they are still super tasty. They also have a great regular breakfast of eggs, toast, potatoes, and bacon. The potatoes seem to be oven roasted and aren't greasy at all. That's the thing I really love about Rachel's kitchen, everything is done with your health in mind. I have only had lunch here once and my sandwich was nothing special. The onion rings were delicious, but there were only about 3 or 4 of them, which was disappointing. \n\nThis is a great place to relax and enjoy a meal that you won't feel guilty about later, so go grab a seat on the plaza and be serenaded while eating some delicious food!"
1,"Yummy! Thin ices are great. Right next door so I go there a lot. Only drawbacks - Wish they had more thin ice flavors, and they are sometimes understaffed to handle the amount of customers in line."
0,"The food I've tried is so/so but nice decor and the owner and staff are very friendly.  \n\nThe naan can be hit or miss here.  One time it tasted like pita bread (maybe they ran out?) and another time it tasted like OK naan out of the tandoor.\n\nThe Chick Tikka Masala is decent.  Vindaloo is not great, in fact most of their curries (like the Mantra Masala) taste alike just different heat levels.  Have tried the tandoor mixed grill and it was satisfactory.  The malai kofta is decent but the gravy is more like a soup.  \n\nAlso, one thing I noticed about this place is that the dishes are consistently underseasoned.  I read somewhere that most Americans consider Indian food to be salty so maybe this is an overreaction to that?  Not sure.  But I always have to add salt to the entrees.\n\nPricing is a kinda high and they charge you a lot for every little thing - rice, raita, mango pickle."
1,"Un classique pour regarder le soccer ou le football sur \u00e9cran g\u00e9ant. Parfait comme endroit quand il y a plusieurs matches simultan\u00e9ment  (exemples : qualifications de la Coupe du monde de soccer, Ligue des champions ou derni\u00e8res semaines de la saison de la NFL) et qu'on souhaite garder un \u0153il sur ce qui se passe un peu partout. Bonne ambiance pendant les matches importants. Pendant la Coupe du monde 2010, j'y ai eu le plaisir de d\u00e9jeuner en regardant le match d'ouverture. Un des rares endroits qui ouvrent lorsque des matches ont lieu \u00e0 des heures inhabituelles ici."
0,"I bought stuff from this place twice. Tookmforever because the selection was bad and prices ridiculous. Quality not so good, for slver there were better dealsmat tj maxx than using a 100. Off coupon. They alsontried to tell us my wife's diamond was shattered when we inquired about a trade in. Most of their sales help were like used car salespeople and lied through their teeth. I had three negative shopping experiences here, returned everything bought, and found higher quality at lower prices elsewhere. BUYER BEWARE. Sorrt for typos, using my ipad."
0,"I've been to this location a couple times these past 2 months. Once for a friends birthday and the other was for a friend's farewell dinner, which occurred last night. Last night had to be one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had mostly due to poor service. \n\nWhen I went to order I noticed the sign on the wall advertising fudge Nutella crepes for $13.99 on the menu it states Nutella crepes for $12 +scoop of ice cream from $3 more. I asked my waiter what the difference was between the advertised item on the wall and the one on the menu. He looked at me, dumbfounded, and said \""I don't know what you're talking about...they don't tell me anything around here.\"" And after beating the bush for awhile he finally said, \""I can ask if you want I guess\"" (which he probably should've done in the first place). Then I asked if they had cookies and cream ice cream and he said \""uhh yeah you can put ice cream on there for $3 or $4 or something like that\"" he acted very unprofessional at that point. Our meals came out and I was pretty disappointed with my fudge Nutella crepe. It was not worth $17!!! \n\nWe also ordered a pizza (with mushrooms and pepperoni) - that did not really look cooked to order and had a huge hole in one of the slices, basket of French fries and onion rings (creamy chipotle sauce was pretty awesome), a sandwich (not the best honestly), and a banana split crepe (this order was brought out wrong, the waiter brought my friend the banana split dessert meal for 2, not the crepe). The waiter brought my friend out the wrong order and it took a very long time for him to get the correct one out. At this point he probably should've offered her an incentive for having to make her wait and watch us all eat our food. \n\nWe ordered the white gummi bear goblet mixed cocktail drink which was pretty delicious, but way too sweet to drink all of it. And I ordered an amber ale. At the end of our dinner, our waiter claimed he accidentally charged us for the table's meal next to us, so he said he needed to void our checks and do it over again. We waited a longer amount of time but the second time he brought us our checks they were all the same prices so it really didn't make any sense to us. \n\nMy friend asked the manager for a void receipt and after waiting for a longer period of time once again, we found that we were double charged and one of the orders was never voided... Overall terrible service and food isn't great for what you're paying for. It is overpriced. So if it were my choice, I would not come back to this place again."
1,"After trying out a few other nearby places, I have been most pleased with Maple Cleaners.  First, they do all the cleaning on-site rather than have have your clothes delivered to a warehouse and then brought back in a van the next day. I'm not sure why I like that so much, but I do.  Their prices are fair and they have always done an excellent job with my suits, shirts, jackets, slacks, etc.\n\nThey offer next-day pickup and the staff is friendly.  One time sticks out in particular:  I brought in a suit I needed early the next morning for an important meeting and when I drove up, she saw me and remembered me, grabbed my suit before I even made it to the counter, and wished me luck at the meeting."
1,Nice little Mediterranean place. People here are very welcoming. Love to visit this place again.
1,"Close enough to the strip to walk if you want of 10 by cab. Felt safe, which in Vegas off strip isn't always the case. Left my top down on the car, only prob in the morning was the yellow Lamborghini parked next to it :)\n\nClean room, quiet, easy check in and super nice staff. AM breakfast manager was helpful. Downside?  Pool was just closed for renovations...in June...really?  Why not January?"
1,"WOW! So Great\n\nMy son and I went there for late lunch. I ordered the Biggie Dad, (brisket, pork, and hot link) on a bun with pickles, mac n cheese. My son got same. We really 3 enjoyed it. We back and order one to go, and the Guy ask me if I was local, said Yes! He ask me since I had on my Danica Patrick shirt if I like Nascar, said yes. He gave 4 free tickets to the truck race this weekend. How cool is that! A great place to return back too."
1,"Believe it or not, this Safeway is a decent spot for breakfast. There's a breakfast sandwich with eggs, (yellow or white) your choice of cheeses and Ham, bacon or Sausage for only $1.99. This combines with their small, in-store Starbuck's will get you a great breakfast for under $5\n\nThere's even reasonable seating!"
0,I was contacted by guest services and all that was said that they were sorry. Thanks for the apology.  At least they have someone all over the reviews that they get.
0,"Definitely a varied menu with many choices, but each option only differs slightly from the next and a lengthy menu equals quality by no means. Pancakes to me are a breakfast treat, a couple times a month indulgence. And so when I eat one, I want it to be really, really good. These guys just don't equate to more than some en mass batter topped with a few varied ingredients. Maybe next time I'll opt for one of the house specialties--definitely look good in the picture--look like more than your average pancake."
1,Hash house is always an option whenever I'm in Vegas. Portions are huge so sharing might be a good idea.\n\nI've had the Chorizo Hash and also Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Both are delicious! \n\nThe location at The Quad is also open 24/7.
1,"I absolutely love Joy Ride.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is great and the food is even better. I typically go in on the weekends and sometimes we have to wait a little bit to be seated but it is worth it.\n\nThe chips and salsa are amazing, and normally I go for the tacos. Crispy Fish is my favorite. Tortillas, batter, and sauces are so yummy.\n\nMy only complaint is that sometimes with their style of service (you don't have one particular server, they all kind of split zones and help out), you end up telling multiple people \""No, I don't need another refill\"" or whatever the case is. But all in all, wonderful!"
1,"Dana is absolutely wonderful. I suffered with chronic tendonitis in my fingers for over a year before I saw her. I had been treated by 3 specialists, had physical, occupational and hand therapy and was still in a lot of pain. I felt better after the first session, and after three more treatments my pain is almost completely gone. Besides pain relief, the whole experience is very calming and relaxing, it's wonderful for stress reduction. Dana is very soothing, calm, caring and compasionate. She has made a positive change in my life. Thank you Dana!"
1,"Amazing food and very courteous service. The waitress was very attentive and the presentation of the food is stellar! It is pricey, but you do get what you pay for here."
0,"I usually enjoy Starbucks if I want a sit-down breakfast alone away from home. The Starbucks at Von's Plaza is too tiny to expect to get seating, so I took my business to Einstein's next door.  Guess what? Same problem: tiny seating area. However, I think Einstein's gets slightly less traffic, so I was able to get a table.\n\nAlthough Einstein's definitely has many more food options and therefore a bigger breakfast selection, I think Starbucks wins the breakfast sandwich contest. Theirs is hotter and tastes better.  Einstein's turkey sausage sandwich was bland and the cheese wasn't even melted. Bleh."
1,My girlfriend and I came in for dinner on Wednesday and had a great experience. I tried the veggie burger and my girlfriend had the ensalada salad and both were excellent. The atmosphere of the restaurant was great but the service was the reason we will return. The hostess was helpful and patient as we decided where to sit.Ryan the busser was working very hard and never stopped moving. Our server Tim was extremely helpful and made sure our food came out quick and accurately.
1,"Although, I stay loyal to Alternate Reality comics, I have to give this location credit for cleanliness, organization, staff support, and overall ambiance of it all. Is it me? or are the Maximum Comics completely obsessed with DC comics? I'm a Dark Horse/Marvel kind of girl :) \n\nWhat I enjoyed: Vast selection and variety, seating area, refreshments, posters, t-shirts, Kidrobot accessories \n\nNot a bad place to check out :)"
0,"Brasserie K. What to say? Let's start with it would have been acceptable at less than 2 thirds the price, maybe half. So you can tell where this is going.\n\nLet's start with the Chef: Charles-Antoine Cr\u00eate. He represents pretty much all my pet-peeves about my Qu\u00e9becois culture. He's unable to master the language and talks like what as a kid we called \""Farmers\"" (Turned out we were wrong as most are better educated than the urban folks) by using the basest Joual vulgarities. There's a difference between the word FOOD and the word MEAL, but this is lost on him. Plus his table etiquette is ridiculously missing from a man who everyone seems to consider a great chef. There's a way to holding a spoon my friends. Then there's his condescending behaviour with even his family and friends when he's on TV shows such as l'\u00c9picerie on Radio-Canada.\n\nThe Restaurant: Hip and modern in tight quarters but it works. However when I'm paying over 100$ for an average meal I could easily dish out in my tinny apartment kitchen, I expect to sit on more than 10$ patio chairs from R\u00e9no-D\u00e9pot. \n\nThe Service: The service was fantastic, can't complain. Our waitress, very beautiful and shapely (but that's just me) could have forgone her fake French accent and since we weren't from the \""In Crowd\"" we did get treated to some look-downs.\n\nBut I can look over a vulgar chef, stupid patio chairs and snobby service... if the food was mind-blowing, but it ain't, let's get this straight, we are talking very ordinary pub grub here. I love gastro-pub, just not this one.\n\nFirst off I really wanted those parmesan fondues. This was a flashback to the glorious 80s... I was hoping from something tweaked or upgraded, but no, just ordinary parmesan fondues, basically fresh made cheese sticks you can get at any restaurant these days. Although, the tomato sauce accompaniment was really good.\n\nThis was followed by the only awesome part of the meal, the Foie Gras plate. This way to pricy portion of Foie Gras was delicious but let's faces it. Foie Gras is hard to fuck up. Salt, pan sear it and just don't overcook it, that's it. So it hardly requires much know-how.\n\nAs the main I ordered the bavette, a gastro-pub staple if you will. This was the weirdest looking bavette I've ever had and tasted like regular sirloin, not the hardier piece of meat it's supposed to be. The pat of homemade butter was horrible and the fries - while really amazing - filled up three quarters of my plate. Fries cost NOTHING to produce; I'm confused as to the price of my plate for this very reason.\n\nThe desert, a profiterole another throwback to the 80s was indeed very delicious, worth it and saved this experience from total damnation. \n\nAll in all, the food wasn't horrible; it was good, but seriously overpriced for what I received while sitting on PVC patio furniture. Pricey enough for me to not return. For the same price and for gastro-pub that is supremely better, just head on over to Taverne Square Dominion on Metcalf. They also have one of the best, if not the best bar in town."
1,"Cannot remember his name but the sales associate who track down a pair of shoe I wanted and didn't stop until he located it at another store and had \""Daisy\"" hold it for me. Thank you! That was great customer service!!"
0,"SMH... Service was OK, atmosphere was LOUD and Tapas were mediocre at best. I would pass on this if you are looking for a quality Tapas. I may be spoiled coming from LA but I wouldn't go back!"
0,"I honestly don't understand what all the hype about Delux is about. I honestly prefer Fez. \n\nThe meat is supposed to be this amazing, specially raised beef - that's all good, but could you maybe add some flavor/spice to it? I'm not sure they even added salt. Besides that, my bun was soaked with juice. Really? I've never even got that at Burger King. \n\nThe one positive thing I have to say, is that the atmosphere is pretty cool and they are open late. BUT..even though they are open late..it's not enough for me to go there even when late-night options are slim."
0,Cool atmosphere but overrated for average ramen. I would recommend Misoya instead for ramen.
1,Life guards are young and don't in force the rules. They have a special line for gold pass holders and priority! To be able to get in early BUT they are allowing everyone anyone And everyone where ever. Seems unfair and you are not receiving the benefits you should be for pAying more.
1,"Love this place! I only wish they had better hours. This would be a great place to have lunch for office meetings or just with friends, but they are only open for dinner. That would be a huge bonus. But, I have always had great service and food here. The other night the waitress forgot to put our food order in and she gave us a free appetizer then and another one for our next visit. The ambiance is perfect for a date."
0,"The food here is lousy for such an establishment. For just a little over 20 dollars we received an Avocado sandwich, Turkey Bacon Rustica sandwich, and a strawberry smoothie. \n\nWell.... The avocado was quartered and put on the sandwich which made the greenish brown bits slippery thus, fall out frequently onto your plate instead of in your mouth. To top this the avocado had the stem attached. What could make this any better? Perhaps the bread wasn't quite leavened to the point of a bakery shop's presumed reason to exist. I'm not sure why we actually ate this (We were quite hungry). The Turkey Rustica wasn't that much better. For having the word bacon in it, I do not remember actually being able to taste any sort of bacon within its contents. The bread also seemed to be a bit stale, but it was at least cooked correctly. \n\nTo be fair some of the more finer points is that this place made a good tasting smoothie (although, one can argue how hard that is). Being from the west coast, perhaps I am just a snood to what a good upscale bakery/sandwich/cafe shop should be. This is not that kind of example."
0,"I've been having a run of really bad lunch destinations in the past week. \n\nI was craving Mexican food earlier this week and a coworker had a coupon for a buy one get one free entree at Qdoba. Now I'm not really sure what an entree consists of at a place where everything is ordered a la carte, but figured that a burrito was as good a guess as any, so I opted for the pork.\n\nNow, according to their menu this pork had been simmered in a blend of tangy tomatillos, jalapenos, garlic and lime juice...and their marketing division deserves props for that appetizing description, because it's all a smoke and mirror act. It tasted like pork. Plain old pork. Very tender pork, but straight up pork all the same.\n\nAdd cilantro lime rice (uh, plain ole white rice with specks of green?); black beans (at least they didn't try anything pretentious there); pico de gallo (some of the blandest tomatoes and onions to ever grace a burrito); roasted chile corn salsa (for real, now? because I couldn't taste a hint of pobalano chile or jalapeno); and salsa roja (writing it in Spanish makes it more authentic. duh.), and wrap it up in a tortilla with a diameter the width of your torso. What do you get? A bland 3,000 calorie monstrosity of a burrito that needs to be dressed up with guacamole, cheese and lots of salsa to make it edible, if not very palatable.\n\nWe got the food to go and the bag for our two burritos felt like the bottom was going to fall out. Out of curiosity, I weighed the burrito when we got back to the lab. It was over 610.00 grams because my electronic scale recorded the weight as \""Err,\"" and that's its max limit. That's over 1 pound and 5.43 ounces for you non-metric folk out there. Or if you prefer to express its weight more figuratively, it was the size and weight of a bunny, but didn't taste nearly as good. (Conejos son muy sabrosos!)\n\nI've also tried two tacos (pork and beef, see above for insight into the caliber of ingredients) and the three chile queso dip with chips. It was, to put it mildly, a disappointment. \n\nBut if you're looking for a sterile, fast food environment (seriously, if Chipotle is owned by McDonald's...who owns this joint?) where you can take bland, picky eaters to enjoy burritos that constitute more than your entire recommended daily allowance of calories in one fell swoop, hit up Qdoba. With that info in mind, you won't be disappointed!"
1,"Love this local pizza shop! Our family has ordered here for several years, always great service and consistent food.\n\nThe hot sauce tends to be on the hotter side so we only choose the \""mild\"" sauce and it's warm enough.\n\nI would recommend this pizza shop."
0,"We ate at this restaurant two years ago. I thought it was one of the best Cajun restaurants outside of Louisiana.  \nWe returned tonight.  What a mistake!   This is a poor excuse for a restaurant, much less Cajun .  Service is SLOW!!!  Food is tasteless or over seasoned.  The soup was served lukewarm.  We can not understand why the health department hasn't shut this poor excuse for a restaurant down.\nDO NOT BOTHER TO EAT HERE!  It is a waste of money.  To top it off wait service is auto tip for 6!"
1,"I just learned that after its long hiatus, PASTRAMI is back at Subway.  YAY!!  So of course I whipped into the first one I came to, this one right here in the Lowe's Center to bite into one.  I had them warm, not toast it, & pile it up with cheese and my choices of other goodies in addition to the Pastrami, & it was delicious!\n\nThe restaurant here doesn't have booths, except for 1/2 of one that was facing the morning sun, so that's a bit of a minus for me, so 5 Stars for the sandwich & 3 for the dining room...  4 altogether.  (Now we just need to get them to serve soup all year.)     :-))\n\n6\"" Pastrami Sub $5"
1,"You really need a whole day to see this centre. The gardens are spectacular, as are the views."
0,"I need to agree with the other reviews. This place is just not good. The food is blah and overpriced. The bar area is dirty and not well stocked. The customer service is below par. They have a small outdoor seating area but it also doubles as a place for all the bar patrons to come out and smoke. If this restaurant was not in the heart of the Mt. Lebanon business district it would be a struggle to survive. Location, Location, Location. just my opinion."
1,It's a win when you see your best friend get a grown man's ass rubbed in her face. Then have her face shoved towards his crotch. \n\nI HAVE NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY LIFE. IT WAS TOO MUCH FUN!
1,"Yes, this is another branch of Pizza Express to grace Edinburgh. But, unlike the sigh I exhale from seeing another McDonalds or Starbucks open, Pizza Express is a chain I rejoice in seeing spread.\n\nThere is no denying that the pizzas they make are top notch and with a few peronis and some good company you can't do much better in terms of pizza and beer.\n\nI emphasise the pizza and beer though, as this is the focal point of dining here.\n\nThis particular branch is new and snazzy and has a convenient location just off the royal mile."
1,"I can only comment on their lunch bento menu and I would say that for the price and the quality, this is one of the best place in Southwest Las Vegas. \n\nVery nice and comfortable family place with very attentive staff. My waitress probably re-filled my green tea 10 times while I was there. Always smiling and most importantly, often overlook in many busier restaurants, there are plenty of staff to help you with your needs.\n\nThe soft-shell crab roll was pretty good and the sashimi was fresh. For lunch, the portion is just right. I can't wait to return to sample their dinner menu."
1,"I've been here about 4 times now, and I've never had a bad time! I know it's not the most glamorous club in Vegas, but hey, I'm not knocking any stars without good reason! There is always good music being played and fun people to bump into, from my experiences. All the bartenders I've interacted with are super friendly too! The inside dance floor/bar areas are great but the patio overlooking the strip is what makes this place unique - it's too bad it was closed on my last trip (February). Cold weather, perhaps?"
0,"I started getting my eyebrows threaded at the location in Town Square which is now closed. I have visited this location several times but now have found I much prefer the one on Sahara and Durango. \n\nOverall this place is average. I had never been fully satisfied with my eyebrows until I started visiting a specific lady. Her name is Farrah and she is amazing. I would not recommend going to anybody else. She is the ONLY one that has ever asked me what I want to do and how I would like it done. While I have not had anything threaded other than my eyebrows, I am always happy when I go to her. \n\nI had a difficult time deciding what kind of rating I wanted to give. Two stars seem appropriate being that the aestheticians that work there aren't talkative, although not rude, and never confirm what I would like done with my eyebrows. It is the same at every location I have visited. Including the one on Fort Apache and Tropicana as well. I am still in the process of growing out part of my eyebrows so they can be symmetrical. I can't believe it took me so long to find Farrah.\n\nOne good thing I recommend no matter which location is the annual unlimited eyebrow threading. I paid $150 for mine which ends up being about 10 individual times. Going every week or two definitely makes the price worth it."
1,"My husband and I have now eaten here twice and it's become a new favorite. The service is fast but friendly and attentive. The owner made a point of coming to talk to us and thank us for being repeat customers.\n\nWe've eaten breakfast and lunch here and found both meals to be satisfying and reasonably priced. I enjoyed the Florentine omelet, especially the fresh spinach and generous use of feta. The addition of peppers and onions to the hash browns is a nice touch. \n\nFor lunch, I had the spanakopita and Greek salad. I would have been happy to get the large slice of spinach pie with just the salad on the side but the salad was so generous it came on a plate of its own. My husband had the pork souvlaki with a side salad which was also tasty. We shared the baklava for dessert and it was delicious.\n\nThe restaurant is clean and cheerful. The Greek music in the background is fun but low enough that it's easy to carry on a conversation. YaYa would approve."
1,"Very awesome place. Best cape store I've been to. Very friendly and chill environment, good blends and lots of educational help on products and use. Will be going back for sure, been there a few times already!"
0,"The food is really good, the head server is rude and the service is slow"
1,"Five stars is based on the free parking alone!  \n\nI'm a Hilton Rewards member, so they upgraded me to a suite AND I was the guest of the day, so I got some free bags of chips and water bottles.  Not much, I know, I know, but I don't really care because I was so excited to win something!  \n\nBeds were comfy, and I looooove breakfast buffets!\n\nPretty good location."
1,"Psssst! Hey you...have you heard about South Seas Thursdays at Tiki Lounge in the Southside yet? No?! Well, let me clue you in to one of the best kept secrets in the Tiki underground of the 'Burgh. \n\nLucky the Painproof Man...yes, THAT Lucky, the one who Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museums have determined to the the #1 sideshow act in the world...AND the lovely grass-skirted Greta concoct and create AUTHENTIC tiki drinks made with top shelf rums and many other of only the best-of-the-best liquors, housemade AUTHENTIC falernum, orgeat and other tiki syrups and liqueurs and fresh-squeezed juices. Nope, these aren't the overly sweet, garishly hued cocktails that you used to THINK were tiki, these exotic cocktails are made from the recipes of none other than Trader Vic and Beachbum Berry and from various classic 40's, 50's and 60's tiki bars that created the laid-back, liquid lifestyle that is tiki.\n\nOn a recent Thursday my cocktail of choice was Planter's Punch - and yes, it certainly packed one. A punch, that is. I've also enjoyed a Hurricane - nope, not the Hawaiian punch-colored (and, unfortunately, flavored, too) sort, but a REAL Hurricane made with fresh-squeezed juices; a lovely Mai Tai; a Lucky original with coconut, coffee, rums and I'm not sure what else - amazing; a Jet Pilot; Grog...and so, SO many others. \n\nWhether your choice of poison is a Sufferin' Bastard, a Zombie (enjoyed by many on Halloween, no less!),  Singapore Sling, or a Mai Tai...whether it comes in a tiki mug or a glass adorned with colorful paper umbrellas, cherries, wheels and wedges of citrus, fancy straws or even a tall, spiky pineapple leaf...whether you come with a group or all by your lonesome, you WILL enjoy the cocktails and the company of fellow tiki-philes.  \n\nMaking Thursday evenings even more special are the exotic sounds of DJ Dr. Zombo who sets the tiki mood with South Seas sounds and surf rock. Gotta love those marimbas and jungle bird calls! And if you're REALLY fortunate, you might hit on a night when Dr. Zombo breaks out the guitar and joins fellow musicians for surf rock sounds by Vertigo Go!\n\nYou can get tiki drinks at the Tiki Lounge any day of the week, but ONLY on Thursdays from 4-9 pm can you get the best of the best of tiki cocktails made by masters. Need a get away? This is it! Sigh...I only wish EVERY night was a South Seas night."
0,"I had really high hopes for this place.  I'm a Vegas regular, going there at least once every other month.  I usually stay at the strip hotels, but since Groupon offered a deal for 2 nights stay with a $100 pool credit, I decided to try it out with a friend (who also is a Vegas regular) who also bought the Groupon.\n\nWe really wanted to like this place, but what we experienced were inconsistent service and lots of little annoyances that add up quickly.\n\nThe bad service:\nThe check-in clerk at Palms Place (their condo/apartments property that we ended up getting booked at) had a crappy attitude.  It's common practice in Las Vegas to ask and hope to receive a free upgrade.  You don't always get it, but it never hurts to ask.  This guy looked at us as if he was offended that we would even ask.  I know some people who booked with separate Groupons received free upgrades to 2-bedroom suites, so it has worked for others.  It didn't matter that we didn't get the upgrade.  But that attitude was just wrong.  A courteous \""sorry we don't have anything available\"" would suffice.\n\nHe also thought we had a $25 credit at the pool.  When we corrected him and told him it was actually a $100 credit, he asked us to prove it.  He acted like he's never heard of such an offer.  Luckily my friend had his 3G iPad with him and was able to pull up that information right away.  Again, we were treated like we were trying to pull a fast one on the hotel.\n\nTo get ready for gambling, we went to Club Palms, their player's club, to sign up for memberships.  The lady behind the counter, while friendly, was sort of a downer.  She mentioned their rebate program where they will give you a rebate on your gambling losses.  I jokingly said, \""But I plan on winning!\""  She asked \""what do you play?\""  I told her slots and tables.  She said something along the lines of I will definitely lose on the slots.  I said \""The Palms is supposed to have better slots, you advertise the slots are looser than the strip.\""  She said \""No they're not.\""\n\nThat's not something you want to tell customers.  And you certainly don't want to tell customers they're going to lose at your casino.\n\nOther bad service and annoyances:\nMy friend was playing the slots next to me when his machine \""crashed\"" while paying out on a $30 hit.  The slot attendant and tech were very friendly in trying to fix the problem, but unfortunately when the machine came back online (about 30 minutes had passed at this point), it did not register the money he had won.  It only had a record of how much he had in the machine ($60.20).  Calling the slot manager over, he looked skeptical that my friend had won.  The manager, unfriendly from the beginning, asked him \""How do you figure you won $30?\""\n\nMy friend explained all the various lines on the reels (which were intact and still on the winning combinations) where he hit various bars and bells and 7s.  Really, not his job to explain how he won $30.\n\nReluctantly, he agreed, \""Ok, so we owe you $90.20?  Is that what you're thinking?\""  I can tell, the guy did not believe my friend at all.  By the way, there's no apologies for the inconvenience, for making us wait there while they sort this all out, nothing.\n\nSo another 10-15 minutes passed, and the manager sent the slot attendant to come back.  She said \""you're lucky, the manager rounded up.  Here's $91.\""  (Lucky indeed!)\n\nApparently after I went back to my room after this, the manager located my friend and told him that after inspecting the machine and the records, that he indeed was correct, and that my friend truly was owed that money.  It was only then that he apologized.\n\nThe whole experience at Palms was just sub-par.  I really wanted to like Palms as an alternative to the strip hotels, but unfortunately this was not it."
1,"I had to take 1 star away because it's a bummer when 2 of the signature items are sold out. I made quite a journey to taste the beef brisket and ribs but they were both gone. As I searched the menu, nothing else really jumped out at me other than the fact that a turkey leg was $19. I get it that their meat is smoked in house for 8 hours, but Holy smokes! The menu was a little pricey, so I just went for the Nacos which were scrumptious and the 3 for 10 moonshine shots only because I had never had moonshine before. The homemade apple pie moonshine sample is what sold me. If I was a regular at Bootleggers, I'd be a lush for that shot! The 4 cheese mac and cheese was above average but I wouldn't need it again. I have high hopes for the beef brisket and ribs on my next visit."
1,If you sign up for their rewards program you will get $$ back and 20% off coupon for ALL your shopping on special days so it's a pretty good deal.  This store is well stocked and clean.
1,"The Peppermill feels like a truly Las Vegas experience! Anyplace else in the world and this place would be quite out of place but in LV, it's freaking perfect! Neon all over the place and kitschy as hell! (In a good way) I know all the reviews talk about this but I can't stress this enough: the portions are huge!! If you're like me and like to have leftovers, by all means get a plate just for yourself and unless you're Joey Chestnut or Adam Richman, you can expect more than enough for another full meal at home. If you're a tourist though and won't be taking a doggie bag, please do yourself a favor and share a plate with your partner so there won't be so much food wasted. The only reason I gave 4/5 is because the waitress, although friendly, just wasn't super attentive. That being said, I'd definitely come back and would most likely bring a date because this restaurant/lounge is just too kitschy/glitzy/vegasy (is that a word?) not to love."
1,"My GF and I ordered the shrimp wanton soup, beef curry over rice, and the #1 (i don't remember exactly what it was called but it had chicken with 2 sauces with rice) for ~18.\n\n- The price of a McDonald's value meal, maybe less! Real cheap! around 5 bucks each. Good portion too! \n- A taste you can't complain about! kinda...haha\n     - The soup comes with 8 wantons, which we ordered. If you opted for the noodles, then you get only 5. Needs more soup to compensate for all that wanton. \n     - The beef curry was my favorite. I highly recommend it! The beef is very tender. The waiter told me they bake it for 7-9 hours! Comes with lots of curry, so i needed more rice.\n     - The #1 was alright. I loved the hot sauce, which was not too hot, but use it with the beef curry and it will be very satisfying.\n- Great service! Maybe bc we were the only ones there, but the waitress and chef talked to us and gave recommendations. They even left the water container on the table for us :)!!!\n\n^____^!"
1,AWESOME shrimp and grits.
0,"Coming from a long drive from Cali and checking in South Point hotel, decided to skip casino food. Headed to KFC, fairy new which was a good sign. Wow was I wrong, the cashier was new and did everything wrong. The person who was supposed to help was to busy doing ofher things. After a good ten miserable minutes the order was complete but receipt printer was suddenly down. After getting the order the cake that was supposed to come with order was not with the order. I ordered one cup for water for my daughter and they told me there are out (after I paid for four cups for sodas), I still insisted on a cup, then they offered one but $.69, after paying almost $50.00. I don't know but that particular location their management really suck balls big time. If all these negative reviews keeps climbing up hill that place will surely cease to exist because everyone pays attention and my behalf I went there because its fairy new"
0,"This is my first review and only because I've been here plenty of times but I can say that if you're looking for a quick drink or a couple shots to begin your night. This is definitely the place... You can't expect much from Hidden House... (Ahem- my parents, back in their 40's sometime during the 90's) used to entourage to Hidden House while the children of the \""church BBQ night\"", spent our nights at home. Interestingly enough, I've had some okay experiences here with the \""locals\"" seeing as how I am one... Anyone can buy me a flower, here anytime ;)... Bands... Meeeehhhh.... Socially, it's not TOO BAD, service is alright but all I can say is Don't expect much... Me and my sister venture here when WE MUST... given it's one of possibly 6 dive bars available within the 1 mile radius... I've definitely had better... But we'll still go... & we don't expect much from the moment the doors blow open with a refreshing whiff of \""once existent old cigarette\"" aroma... add a dash of beer stains and a slight hint of... BO? What would you expect?"
1,"First time trying one of Bobby Flay's restaurants and it did not disappoint!\n\nThe order: \nTiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale (appetizer)\nFire Roasted Veal Chop (main course for me)\n22 oz Bone in Chipotle Glazed Rib eye (main course for the boyfriend)\n\nWe started on our appetizers with high expectations for it, being that it was raved about in almost every yelp review.  This was not over hyped.  It was sweet and savory, perfect way to start off your meal! I just wish there were more prawns! i think it came with 3? But it was cooked to pefection! \n\nOur entrees came shortly after our appetizer was finished.... le sigh, i'm salivating as I am conjuring up all the delightful tastes of that night.  Must go back soon!  Ok, back to reality.... My Veal chop was cooked perfectly! Seasoned just right to bring out the maple glaze, horseradish and sage flavors one by one. The meat was tender, but it wasn't melt in your mouth tender. The presentation was fabulous with the bone on the Veal chop still in tact and the tamale resting under the chop. \n\nAlthough my veal chop was perfect, my boyfriend's 22 oz rib eye was BETTER!! SIGHH.... now this, was melt in your mouth tender! The flavors were explosive, like-- little tiny flavor mines exploding in yo mouth. Their chipotle glaze and green and red chili sauce... is in comparable to any other steak sauce that i have ever had..  I am sooo getting this next time. \n\n5 stars, i'd give it 10 if i could..!!!"
0,"Not going back.\n\nI used to go here all the time... when I started going here about 2 years ago, the place was great.  Not conservative with drinks and the food was pretty tasty.  The waiters were nice and friendly.\n\nCame here last nght with a large party of friends and I was not pleased and that opinion was shared by everybody at my table.\n\nWe were crammed in their largest booth... not a problem.  \n\nBut it is a problem when someone has to leave for a minute and so you don't want to make everybody move again, so you come back and sit on the end right?  \n\nWaiter didn't like that and had the cojones to ask us to not move seats.\n\nI understand that it's inconvenient for the waiter as far as the check out goes, but I'm sorry, it's not about them.  If you're paying my bill, you can call the shots on where I sit in my booth.  But since you're not, we will figure out who gets what bill especially when all of us have our own separate checks anyway.  We know who got what and we'll help the waiter figure it out because we aren't total assholes... so don't ask us to not move seats when we aren't in chairs.\n\nI had the california shrimp salad... used to be better.  The dressing wasn't that great, a couple tomatos in it weren't as fresh as I felt they should be.\n\nBut the kicker... after nobody had had no more than 2 beers and it was clear we had DD's (I was one of them), we were told that they were cutting us off.  Yes, we are loud and have fun and laugh, but isn't that what you're supposed to do???  \n\nApparently that's not ok with this Applebees.\n\nBad enough, those of us that were drinking something other than alcoholic didn't get any refills of what we were drinking... \n\nI'm not going back.  It has just gotten worse and worse there and so they might as well just shut down their bar and make it a family restaurant if they want people to quietly sit and eat their food and not complain about poor service."
0,"So my buddies and I were celebrating with our buddy Matt by giving him a bachelor party and he found a cheap price per room at the Imperial palace. We thought it would be cool since it's on the middle of the strip across from Caesar's, it's cheap and we at least have a place to stay. The day of arrival, we had to traverse through some construction going on and found our way going through the back entrance. That back entrance was an adventure by itself. \n\nThe ROOMS.... old carpet, old bedding, dim lights, light switches that don't work, the drain was starting to back up in the shower, we couldn't lock the door lock, our balcony was... well just a random balcony with a view of an old stucco wall of the same hotel and the room looked like a motel off the highway.\n\nThe Hotel.... ice machines on our floor didn't work,  the elevator took it's sweet time and never got to our floor when we needed, there was construction going on and it caused traffic jams at the entrance of the hotel, the pool was small for a hotel/casino on the strip, finding the front desk was a real challenge, the hotel atmosphere felt like it was from the 80's, and let's not forget how the hallways smelled so bad.\n\nThis place is cheap for a reason and I now know why I never stayed here the plenty of times I've come to Vegas. If you want a better hotel experience I'd suggest going somewhere else and fork over a little more money. Trust me it'll be worth it. Otherwise if you're just looking for a bed to sleep on and don't care what the place looks like, this is the hotel for you."
1,Total Wine is my choice over Bevmo.  I just like everything about it. What else can I say?  There are far more choices. Its more of a cozy relaxing atmosphere.  I can spend a lot of time here just browsing. Maybe it was me just being thirsty. But I can say there are a quite bit more CSRs there ready to assist with whatever you need.  As I passed a few helping other customers I happened to hear honest opinions in choices.  They weren't trying to force sell anything.  And believe me what I heard was something I would say about something that I have tried.  They also carry my Bud Select which is nice to know that I can pick that up if I cant make any decisions on what to drink.  I am sure I would the next time I visit.  I do plan on being dutchess of Total Wine.
1,"Great friendly staff!\nFood is pretty good!\nBetter than other shacks I went in saying they're Thai, when they really aren't. How can I tell??? I couldn't.  They all look alike and sounds almost the same language.\nBut hey.. Ingot me the Thai beef salad, it's off the chains!!!\nTry it!!!"
1,"Went with a large group for a bachelorette party but was seated right away and had good service throughout the night.  The bread and butter was delicious!  I love when the bread seems fresh and it comes in a loaf where you can rip it off and spread the home-made butter all over that.\n\nThe steak frites is what they're know for and the meat was VERY TENDER.  Delish.  However, mine was a bit salty.  The pomme frites that come with it are more like potato chips than fries.  Three of us shared the green beans and they were a welcome vegetable amongst the carbs and protein.  It was large enough to share comfortably.\n\nGood ambiance.  Overall a nice place for dinner."
0,Noodles were disgusting. Like spiced top ramen. They ruined everything. Anything they touched. Teriyaki chicken was nothing special. Sesame chicken had a bone in it. Drinks are way overpriced. Egg drop soup alright. There's a reason there's no line for this establishment.
1,"Steak, beer, peanuts and you dont have to clean up whats not to like? You will find all of the above at this joint. I was surpised that the food was decent and my steak was very good. The prices were ok and the happy hour beer specials were great. The best part was that I had two small children with me and they could make a mess with the peanuts and I didn't have to worry about it. If you have children you will fit in with the crowd before 7:30. If you don't, I would suggest you come in after 730 to avoid all the kids."
1,"went in tonight on my way home and scored two pairs of $35 sweats for $12 each, yea!!! also found a beanie for my kid for $7 not such a great deal but it does have a Nike swoosh on it and we all know that = $$$$ it was marked down from $15. this place is hit and miss but i have always been able to find a decent deal on something i wanted when i go in. check it out. the mall is kind of dumpy but they are remodeling it so hopefully one day it will be nice."
1,Get the waffle cone! The surprise at the end is a nice surprise!\nMany flavors to pick from and the employees are always nice.\nMissing a 5th star only because they do not take cards which can be a bummer! ATM on site but it charges a fee. :(

1,"This was our first visit to Paradise Bakery and all I can say is YUM! It was so good, I went back for lunch the next day. The dining room is very pleasant and clean, the service is great and the sandwiches are super yummy. I love having this fairly close to our house!"
0,"\""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" = definition of 2 stars. \n\nThat is pretty much it in a nutshell. \n\nI was looking forward to dining here. Things started off well, the ice tea was tasty, I loved the space and the overall concept is great. \n\nI decided on the Black Bean Burger, even though the waiter could not tell me for sure what was in it and didn't even bother to ask the chef. \n\nBland, Dry, and Boring. Topped with rubbery Shitake Mushrooms and a greasy bun.....sigh.....I was looking for excitement, I wanted to be wowed, nothing happened when I put this food in my mouth, I was extremely underwhelmed. \n\nMy husband ordered the fish tacos. Served along side a pile of sticky rice topped with black beans and mayo? The rice was gluey, the cabbage in the tacos was soggy, it did not taste fresh at all. \n\nThe sweet potato fries were not bad, they were served with the \""Hula Sauce\"" which is ketchup, mayo and pickled ginger. \nIts flavor way OK but became cloying after one of two bites. \n\nSomething is just missing here, if you read the menu, it has potential for greatness, but ends up leaving much to be desired. \n\nSadly it looks like enough people like the sub par \""Bar Food\"" that Hula's won't be likely to make any changes. :-("
0,"Smaller sizes...not much for the plus or large crowd.  Also, the staff is almost incredulously rude everytime I'm in here!  I know people love it here, but it's like a very expensive Goodwill.  The clothes and accessories are way overpriced for what you're getting!  Save yourself some money and go down to the Goodwill at 16th St and Indian School.\n\nAlso, if you have clothes to sell, don't get your hopes up.  Gawd knows I've tried to figure out what they are looking for...when they did take a couple of my smaller size 12 sundresses to consign, they ended up giving them away to a thrift store for dogs (I shit you not) and didn't even bother to call me.  I guess that's not their policy...if you consign here and they don't sell your stuff in whatever time frame they think they should, don't expect to ever get it back."
0,"Ordered their special, which was tilapia, and overcooked and under seasoned. Their burger was average. The only saving grace to this visit was the service the booze and the crab cake appetizer."
0,"After arriving at the nicely decorated and boisterous room I was asked what I wanted to drink. I picked regular water and received a small glass of lukewarm water no ice though I noticed bottled water was nicely chilled. Hmm not a good sign but I persevered. Had a rather dreary and greasy burger which I could not finish, then paid the $25 tab vowing never to return. \nA very discouraging experience."
1,"If you are looking for the BEST indian food in Vegas, this is the place. We have been to many other indian restaurants in Vegas, but this place is unbeatable. Their butter chicken, shrimp saag, paneer tikka masala, naan and chhole is to die for. Come here for the best indian food in Vegas."
1,"AMAZING food, drinks, and service!!!! It is nice to splurge once in a while, and I recommend this place for Romantic dinners, or maybe even a business dinner!!! The Lobster and steak is to die for. Extremely classy place. Very expensive, but was worth it! The Champagne was flowing, and we were front row to the GREAT live band!!! This is a MUST TRY place in Scottsdale!!!!"
1,This place is amazing. I get 80% of my groceries here. They have the best quality and prices for produce in the area. It's also a lot cheaper to buy nuts and raisins etc in the bulk section! Ever need just a 1/4 cup of dried apricots for a recipe? Well no use in buying a whole package when you can just get what you need! They have a pretty good wine selection too and you can get some fairly inexpensive labels to try. \n\nTheir staff is always friendly and can help you find whatever you need. And for those of us who bring our own bags they give you .10 cents off for each bag. Most other stores I know maybe do .5cents or nothing at all. Go on Wednesdays when their sale flyers overlap and you get to take advantage of two weeks worth of sale items!
1,"I had high hopes for Tradiciones, so my husband I paid it a visit for lunch on a Sunday, on our way to grab some groceries at Ranch Market.\nFirst off, after reading some other reviews, I was worried about getting a cold shoulder from the waitstaff -- but nothing could have been further from the truth. Everyone was really nice and the service was great. The mariachi music was awesome, although I'm glad they didn't come over and try to convince us to get a serenade -- I hate that. It makes me uncomfortable...anyhow, the chips and salsa were top-notch. But the meals were just OK. My spinach and mushroom enchiladas had a good green sauce, and I was pleasantly surprised to see they weren't stuffed full of copious amounts of crappy cheddar cheese. Instead they just had *some* white cheese, which was nice. My husband ordered some chicken dish that came with a stew (sorry, can't remember the name). He liked it. We each had a margarita, as I wanted to try the cilantro margarita, but I wasn't too impressed. Granted, for $7, it really packed a punch, but the flavor wasn't too spectacular. Overall, I'd say the atmosphere adds another star to what I would consider a 3-star meal. I'd definitely bring out-of-town guests here, as it's a fun place with decent Mexican food in a town where (sorry, everyone) I find it VERY difficult to find decent, reasonable Mexican cuisine."
0,"The worst experience ever.  We order 3 fresh coconut drinks, 2 came white and 1 came black which tasted weird. We had this many time in other places and it just didn't taste the same, so we kindly ask if we could replace it. The Manager, without any exceptions states that there is nothing wrong and we should just drink it. So we ask for the bill for the drinks.  They made us wait about 15 minutes and charged us for the black spoiled coconut.  The Manager never showed he/her face but gave our sweet waitress such a hard time making her tear. We felt really insulted. Never again would I be back or recommend this to anyone."
1,Hands down best buffet in Las Vegas. Save room for dessert cause the dessert station has quite a selection.
1,"Good food, great bar atmosphere with lots of TVs! Beer specials could be better, but certainly not the worst. Outside patio is an amazing space to watch the games."
0,"The Luxor is probably one of the best looking hotels on the strip from the outside....  \n\nUnfortunately for me and others who stay here on there visit to Las Vegas this hotel is nothing more than the a 1or 2 star hotel, disguised as a 4 or 5 star hotel on the inside.  The room does not match the architecture, the elevator feels like a death trap, the decor is lame and outdated, and the housekeeping isn't the best.  \n\nIn fact, I ask the standard housekeeping immigrant guy you always see pushing the towel cart for some towels and he said \""No\"", I was shocked.  I decided to just go the other route, and just took some off the cart and kept it pushing without asking."
0,"I've been to Moto several times as it's right down the street from me, and it's my go-to when I want average sushi and a Happy Hour drink. The servers are friendly and the menu is really varied; I always question establishments that serve such a stark variation in cuisine, but this place manages to competently serve everything from sushi to stir frys to burgers and sweet potato fries. \n\nI use the term \""competently\"" because it's by no means great food. The sushi is average, at best, but I come back because they have a good happy hour and the ambiance is way better than at your average Japanese restaurant. This place is obviously not authentic Japanese food as you quickly learn from taking a glance at their amusing menu, but I don't mind a little lack of authenticity for the sake of a more comfortable and fun environment. \n\nMy one significant gripe is that they market themselves as a sushi restaurant but the menu appears to be lacking in the most basic rolls; I usually try to order off-menu standards when I'm there like a simple tuna or yellowtail roll and they're usually accommodating. I asked for a regular salmon roll once though, and was told that they only have the smoked salmon that comes in the Philly Roll. A sushi restaurant that doesn't carry raw salmon?! You've got to be kidding me, I hope that my server was just uninformed because that's pretty inexcusable otherwise. \n\nI wouldn't suggest coming here for sushi except during Happy Hour, because their sushi isn't very good and so it's overpriced if you go during regular times."
1,"My wife & I dropped in for lunch as we stumbled upon Gaati while shopping at Trader Joe's. We both had Tom Kah Gai - coconut milk chicken soup with lemongrass for a starter. My wife had the spicy mint chicken and I had red chicken curry. Having spent months in Thailand, the flavors at Gaati are authentic and I share others opinions about prices. All in all, I recommend Gaati for genuine Thai cuisine, even though it's 20% higher in price. But other Thai restaurants don't match the flavors at Gaati. We'll return for another round and let you know."
0,only if you'd like to be fed a trough of food like a pig. disgusting portions. my pancake had an 18 inch diameter. would rather pay for better quality food with normal portions than this mess of a plate. the lighting in here is nauseating. 30 minute meal felt like an eternity in purgatory.
1,"I work right down the street from Kabob Korner so I've def had my fair share of their food - and I LOVE it!  My favorite is the chicken gyro although their hummus is pretty good and so is there chicken and rice dishes.  I got a \""side salad\"" one time but it was enormous - just a warning in case you like to add side salads to your meals.  They are very friendly and will make you custom food too if you ask.  The only thing I wish they had was fountain sodas cuz I hate drinking the ones they have from the can."
1,"Had a great meal here - tasty green enchiladas and loved their guac.  Homemade tortillas were a huge hit with our table!  Service was great - quick, but not rushed and very attentive.  I'll be back again."
0,Cockroaches in the salsa and serving the food. Every time I've been here I wish I had gone else where.
0,"Wow, after reading everyones reviews, I know I'm right about our experience last weekend.  We've been going here to eat off and on over the past 7 years or so.  We've always enjoyed our meal. It's been about a year since we've gone. \n\nThe menu has changed somewhat so we couldn't order what we normally use to order.  Wow, terrible choice.  We decided to order light and just order a  spicy tuna and salmon roll for each of us.  They were so hot we couldn't eat them.  My husband didn't think the rice was made that well.  My husband and I never go home with take out when we go out for Sushi.  Out of 12 pieces each, we each ate 4.  What does that tell you?   I told the waiters working at the counter that it was to hot and they said that we ordered Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon.  No one said,  \""we're sorry, what can do we do for you to make it better\"". \n\nMy children who are in their 20's tried it and also agreed with us.   They are both avid sushi eaters.  I called the owner and talked to him personally that evening.    He said he would check into it for me and get back to me with what he found out.  He never did.  I called him a few minutes ago.    He said that his workers made it normal and that is the way they make it. They didn't put any extra hot spice in it.    I guess the customer is always wrong.  We will never step foot into this establishment and give them our money.  There are to many other sushi places  in the Scottsdale area to go out to eat.  The sushi rolls at Safeway are better and more enjoyable."
0,"This has to be one of the worst tire shops I have ever been to. STAY AWAY!!! This place is a small shop with no experience. The workers are slow, rude and very incompetent. These people could not even take the wheel cap off my wheel. They said they had to break the screw off just to access the lug nuts. I took it off myself. Then they told me I had to wait another hour because they couldn't get the screw loose that I took off myself. I can't imagine letting someone like this work on my vehicle I quickly left and will never go back. I asked why I had to wait longer because of their incompetency to do their job and they quickly got rude and disrespectful. In shirt this place is a joke and most likely won't be around long. You people suck!!!!"
0,"Man, this Ross. It has the best selection of men's clothes, shoes and luggage I've ever seen at a Ross and some killer deals in there, but the layout is also the most atrocious I've seen of maybe any store anywhere. \n\nThey have a ton of floor space to work with but for some reason they have everything set up in long, narrow aisles where it's not possible to pass each other. And the entry/exit system is weird as hell with little poorly marked cattle gates for each even though there's a bunch of ways to go around them. \n\nTons of feral children running around unattended, and this block always seems to have tons of foreign tourists who don't understand how lines work for some reason, but I can't say Ross is doing anything to help them with this slapdash layout. \n\nAnyway, deals to be found, but come in mentally prepared to play the Game of Clothes, you get the bargains or you die"
0,"What a dump. I asked for a non smoking room. I didn't get one. The door man was rude and demanding. \n\nI had to leave, the amount I was asked to pay was a ripoff.; I'd rather sleep in the car!\n\n  My suggestion is to try some of the hotels in Summerlin. It's worth the drive."
1,Outs standing place to eat and enjoy the amazing drinks and great customer service and not to mention the beautiful atmosphere..
0,"Came here a couple of years ago, and it was pretty good.  Came back recently about a month ago, and I was verrrry disappointed.\n\nI love buffets.  I know it's not cool to admit it, but there is something about a place that has so many different kinds of food in so much abundance that appeals to me.  Some people are offended by gluttony, but I relish in it, and we are in Vegas!!  The capital of gluttony.\n\nWe came for a weekday lunch buffet, and I reallly had a hard time finding anything to eat.  They didn't even have shrimp cocktails, boo.  The asian section was BAD.  Beef noodle soup was bland, fried rice was worse than when I make it drunk at 3 am, and the sushi was fishy.  The steak was tough, and pasta was dried up.  Wow, now that I think about it, maybe I should give it one star, since even the service was bad.  We had to flag down the waitress every time we needed the plates removed, and forget about refills on our water.  Dessert might have been better, but I'm not too big on sweets.\n\nFor 40+ bucks, you would expect a little more from a buffet... and it might be a lot better on weekends, but if you're looking for a place to eat on a weekday, stay away!  Unless you're eating here for free since you're a high roller at Wynn, it's so not worth it."
1,"It's the scene to be seen.\n\nThe ultimate party hotel in Vegas. From the risque lobby video pillars, to every bar in the lobby, to Marqee (both day and night clubs), the whole hotel just oozes of sexy. While every party hotel claims to have this, only the Cosmo has it in almost every part of the hotel. EVERY part. That's right, valet pool, lobby lounge, bar, elevators, tables, hotel room.... and maybe even a few of the housekeepers (no... really).\n\nWhat many Cosmo visitors don't realize is that the Vesper Bar in the lobby lounge is one of the top ranked in Vegas for craft cocktails. This place is legit. One of the best, with cream-of-the-crop mixologists, and a cocktail menu to make even New York's elite envious. \n\nChandelier bar? It's like a classic yester-year tribute to old Vegas, a la Liberace, complete with overkill and Moet.\n\nThis is old skool Vegas reborn."
0,"Horrible customer service. I went to the counter and waited 5 mins. The cook or cashier saw me standing there and never acknowledge me. He could have said \""I'll be right with you\"" but said nothing.  I continued to stand there and was never helped. I just left. Seriously needs better staff. Unacceptable"
0,"For me, it wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it was just \""ok\"". I went here with my sister because she raves about it all the time. We barely filled two cups and it was a little over $10.. I felt a little bad about paying that much for mediocre fro-yo and a couple sprinkles on top.. ."
1,"Felt  level of service, once the cornerstone of this Spago location, has dropped a notch. We sat at the bar where pro s like Peter and Tony once ruled the fortress. These guys looked like they were in grade school. Effecient but dry, not friendly. We weren't brought or even offered a bread basket despite ordering a full dinner. Sorry but that is weak. We also saw amd heard some animated bickering between a female bartender and a server. The short chubby GM guy who has been there awhile watched it from afar without stopping it or letting them know this type of behavior was unacceptable.  This GM seems to have gotten complacent in his job.  If i were a higher up in PUCK enterprises, id give this guy a dressing down or a demotion. This is not the Spago i once knew.\n\nYet make no mistake. The food is still great. Executive chef Eric Klein has put the Puck staple Chinois Chicken salad on the spring 2013 menu and this salad is as good as any you will eat. The Hong Kong stlyle Salmon was excellent. The Rigatoni Bolognese was stellar, however a bit rich. Id recommend getting it easy sauce.\n\nWe didnt get dessert. A dessert menu was not offered to us either, again another sign of our first overall less than stellar Spago experience.\n\n2 days later, with limited time before we had to head to airport, we went to the Spago Bar for a quick bite.  I told the female bartender with green eyes and freckles that i needed the food rushed. My wife got a salad and i ordered a pizza.  Both were great.  The Pie had too much cheese on it IMO. Wood Fire pies are cooked at high heats for a short time. Generally they need to have limited sauce and cheese.  Was still solid and i forgot to ask for ez cheese like i always do.  This bartender was solid.  Offered us bread despite the casual curcumstances and time of day. She was friendly but professional and got us our food out within 13-14 minutes.\n\nWe will be back as it is one of our favorite spots in Vegas.  We hope to see the old familiar faces and the level of service we are accustomed to."
1,Pool is good but don't like feeling like cattle as they holler at me to go past the blue line in the wave pool.  Suggestion: do waves for a few minutes then a period of still water.  Hint: Monte Carlo.  That and change the overly strict 'one towel per guest' rule and your pool would be the best!!!
0,"Apparently the policy here is \""I can't serve you water unless you buy a drink\"". Greedy ASS Mother Fuckers!"
1,Patio is awesome\nperfectly place downtown VMR (in front of the park).\nLittle hidden city that looks like England.\n\nPerfect Spot\nExcellent rustic oven Pizza
1,"Best steak place in Charlotte, hands down.. service is excellent. .. can be pricey.. Try the VIP drink and the Long bone steak."
0,"I really like the location of this PT's. It has a certain charm to it being tucked in under a hill of the Black Mountain. The building looks very new and the interior is smaller, but modern and clean. When I arrived late afternoon on a Thursday there were only couple of other patrons there. The female bartender was very friendly and accommodating. She told me about their $2 Dos Equis special. I usually do a shot of whiskey and a beer if I am not in the mood for a cocktail. They didn't have Jim Beam's Devil's Cut so I settled on Jack Daniel's Honey. I also told her about the Yelp check in special that is good for one free domestic pint or a well drink. She was very excited that someone has finally claimed it. I opted for a whiskey sour and another beer. I asked her if she could change one of the TV channels to a news channel and she happily obliged. If she stayed, this review would have easily been four stars, but it was the end of her shift. A male and female bartender took over. Their focus became on the silver hairs that kept on trickling in -- the regulars I guess. I asked to look at the food menu, and everything was pretty pricey for bar food. The cheapest burger was ~$10... no thanks. I finished my drink and called it a day. The total was only $10.50 because they had good specials and my free check in drink. One star for the location since it is walking distance to the house and one star for the initial bartender. If you're not a regular expect to be ignored."
1,"Okay I really wanted to not like this place.  I did not go for dinner.  With a crew of 8, I went to the Sunday Brunch.  $10.00 bottomless champagne. I repeat $10.00 bottomless refills.  Okay truth be told it's sparkling wine but who cares.  They refill pretty regularly.  You'll be tipsy enough that you won't care that they charge $12.00 a carafe for juice in the event you want to make your own Bellini or Mimosa.  \nThe brunch menu is pretty varied and is surprisingly reasonable.  The scones are mini-scones and are delicious.  It does come with Devonshire cream and jam on the side as they should.  The eggs benedict are some of the best.  Truffled hollandaise was a nice touch.  Go for the regular eggs benedict and not necessarily the short ribs.  The regular ones really are the best flavored.  The bacon is good, if you want to be really decadent go for the pork belly.  It is fatty goodness.\nThe stuffed french toast was more of a large warm jelly-doghnut, not in a bad way.  But if you like decadent French toast go for the french toast at Frank and Albert's.\nThe vibe is very Vegas, or to compare to a place locally, think of Modern Steak at Fashion Square.  Perfect for bachelorette parties.  Purple walls, plush lounges, glass and mirrors everywhere.  The men folk we were with thoroughly enjoyed their experience.  There are many Scottsdale types perfect for people watching."
0,"Let's just say I went there on july 8 and i got charged twice on my credit card. I just placed one drink order and I got slammed! Im not sure why this happened, but bar patrons BEWARE!!!!"
0,"Though this place is just filthy dirty, that's not the reason for the poor review. The employees here just suck. They don't smile, don't even acknowledge you when you say hi; and the worst part is they sit there on the cell phone in front of you. I had a cashier snarl wait at me so he could finish his HEATED conversation on his phone. Dropped my 44 oz drink on the counter and told him where he could stick his cell phone. Will not go back."
1,"We are so fortunate to have this gem in our city! Every room is filled with hundreds of different species of plants, and Phipps has something for everyone to enjoy!"
1,My screen was cracked after my puppy decided to use my  iPhone as a chew toy :/ I had met one of the owners through a networking group and decided to take the drive up to have it repaired when I found out that I wasn't eligible for an upgrade just yet. They took care of getting the repair done quickly and while I waited. Great experience and I would definitely recommend them to a friend (and actually did so a few hours later). So glad the option exists to have it repaired rather than replaced!
0,"Although we have been regular customers of Eastwind, that changed approximately 2 weeks ago.  My kid and I went to get some California Rolls and it took more than 25 minutes and 5 complaints to 3 different employees to get our food.  It's not like it had to be cooked.  I even yelled out my complaint so everyone in the restaurant knew how upset I was.  When the food was delivered, it was almost thrown at us.  \n\nI asked to speak to a manager - but there wasn't one available.\n\nThat is one restaurant that I will no longer frequent. Go there at your own peril."
1,"This is the hidden AJ's.  Not just anyone can come here.  You can't even see the sign from the street unless you're going really slowly and/or not paying attention to the road.  And even then it's further back enough that you can't tell exactly where to turn in or where the entrance is located.  \n\nOnce you've found it, the side entrance and the low ceilings just add to the mystique.  I swear this location is actually darker than other locations as well.\n\nAnd I will say - not even the one in Paradise Valley has quite the same feeling as this location.  There is something extra special here.  It's not just me.  Folks I used to work with felt the same way.\n\nBest meat quality in the valley will always be found at AJ's. Bar none.  And it's right at the top of the list for produce as well.  For everything in their aisles that's non-alcoholic you'll find a great selection of new and different fare right next to the mundane.  But the mundane is at FULL price like you've never even seen at normal stores.   And don't expect to see a sale any time soon.  Oh yea, they get ya. Because while you're in there to get your 2-3 things for a special dinner, you end up also remembering to get mustard, Wheat Thins and a 2 liter of soda and that's an extra $10 here whereas at another store it might be $5.  \n\nSo bring a list to only get what you came for - and don't forget to wear your dark sunglasses so you too can be oh-so-cool in the super exclusive AJ's."
0,"huge disappointment. normally i love all sushi even when it comes from little hole in the wall places.. but this was two thumbs down. they werent crowded what so ever & yet it took sooo long. the lobster miso lacked serious flavor as did almost everything else. im down for dropping big bills for great tasting food but this was just way over priced, bland, & super small portions. i was so pissed i literally wanted to dine & ditch this place."
1,"50's - 60's diner style with lots of period memorabilia & knickknacks (some for sale!). Great food & nice ambiance, but very slow service. Don't be in a rush & you'll enjoy it!"
0,"I guess the mantra for Staples' associates is the same for The Walking Dead - \""run and hide\"". I am waiting now because an associate started to help me ship a package, then took off mid-process. Ummm... bye?\n\nToo bad it's the only office supply store around."
1,Amazing customer service and quality care on all my vehicles. Victor is thorough in his explanation of what is needed and why it is needed. Never any unnecessary diagnosis on my cars.
0,"Well.....I gave this place 3 chances, but I'm done. While the food was good ( I like the twice baked potato skins and my fiance likes the sliders)....the service was so terrible that I just don't want to bother anymore. I have been here three times to eat....twice later at night after work around midnight and once on a Sunday in the afternoon. The server at night, which I think was the same both times, took at least 10 minutes to acknowledge us. She seemed very pre-occupied with her male tables. She was completely unengaging, no smile, no personality....just an \""order taker\"".  Food also takes forever so don't bother if you want a quick bite. (I'm sure skins take a bit to cook....but 30 minutes??) As far as our Sunday afternoon visit, I will say that the server did seem overwhelmed with the football crowd. She messed up our order, forgot we gave her a coupon, took forever, etc. Props though to the bartender who came around from the bar and pre-bussed our table.\nI've been a server for 13 years and its places like these I just want to come in and show 'em how its done!! I could sell the hell out of this place and I have the friendly personality to keep 'em coming back!\n\nOh well...plenty of other places that are more welcoming in the southwest part of town."
1,"After walking the streets of Old Montreal in the cold spring (yes, can you believe that?) we stopped at this little place. The servers are very French about taking your orders and taking their time to serve you. However, the food is great. I ordered a savory crepe with mushrooms and tomato sauce and they can give you either all fries or half and half with a small salad and fries. the food was fresh and reasonably priced.\n\nIf you have a sweet craving, the coffees looked amazing and are made with personally drawn designs using the chocolate and powders."
0,This is a South Side bar in Lawrenceville and defines everything bad that is becoming of the neighborhood. Garbage overpriced food with a crowd of aging frat boys drinking boring drinks. \n\nGo to any other restaurant on butler st and it will be better. You are kidding yourself if you think this is well made food. \n\nThe staff seemed annoyed and angry to be there. I'll be amazed if this place is still around in a few years.
1,I've been here twice now and have been very pleased both times!  They do an excellent job and are very efficient.  The only reason I didn't give five stars was because when they massage your legs and feet for a pedicure it is for a very short amount of time.  Other than that I highly recommend Pro Nails by Julie!
0,"I found this place via Groupon and went with a friend for lunch. The building it is located in in very charming and the patio would be great once the weather cools down a bit. Some of the decor inside the restaurant seems a little outdated but overall I found it very charming and cute - in a downtown Glendale kinda way :) The owner greeted us as we walked in and seated us at a small table right by the front door. As instructed by Groupon we informed him that we had a voucher. I asked him how long the restaurant had been open since this was the first time I had been here and he told me that the restaurant had been open for 5 years and that they were very busy and successful. I didn't want to read into his demeanor, but he came across somewhat arrogant. We decided that we wanted to try several of the dishes and ordered the Greek salad, the cheese and ham plate with toasted bread and the prosciutto bruchetta. The food was good and very tasty but the owner and staff are something else. When we placed the order the owner said something like \""well you Groupon people order so much because you have a voucher\"". I was thinking to myself that if he doesn't want \""groupon people\"" then maybe he shouldn't put out a Groupon. Total turnoff. I enjoy trying new places and Groupon is a great way to find them, therefore I will not be made to feel guilty for using one. I would have been back for another try for dinner, but the owner totally turned me off to going back."
0,"Honestly quite dissapointed with StripSteak based on the four star rating here.  Maybe I just went on their worst night.  The waitress was terrible, took about half an hour to take our orders and hardly came to visit us.  The steak does not compare to other prime steakhouses.  I'm not sure what the fuss is about the fries on these reviews, they are just regular fast food like fries with different dips.  Fortunately the next night we went to Del Frisco's Double Eagle and it made up for this!"
1,"The whole menu sounds delicious, but I went with the Philly Cheese Steak Mac n Cheese. I made a good decision. The mac n cheese is creamy with a lot if stretchy cheese. The veggies and steak in it were also cooked really well. They also use a good amount of pepper and I loved that. The service was friendly and really quick. It's also pretty affordable, and if you can control yourself there's also plenty for leftovers the next day."
1,"Update to my previous review:\n\nNorth is once again a favorite that I find myself frequently much too often. Excellent management, friendly (and dare I say very attractive) bar staff, delicious new drink offerings, and the free WiFi I've always loved. A great place to pull up a seat and work from my laptop. \nThey have also accommodated a menu request that my best friend asked for and have subsequently made it for me. We appreciate that tremendously. I plan to resume riding my cruiser bike to North to park it in the ample bike parking spaces as well as taking my car to the friendly, fast valet on the chillier nights. Excellent."
1,"I LOVE JENNA! \n\nok, I said it. I actually got REALLY lucky finding her/this salon. I moved to Vegas about 1.5 years ago and was having trouble finding a stylist who understood what I was looking for and was consistently leaving salons unsatisfied with my cut (even brought me to tears once!). So...I found the salon that Jenna used to work at (which I won't name!) and looked at their website and decided I would pick the stylist who's personal style was closest to mine...and thus I found Jenna. When I went in for my appointment she gave me EXACTLY what I asked for PLUS I got bangs for the first time as an adult! She gave me her card before I left and advised me that bang trims were free. So, about 3 weeks later I was ready for a trim and called the salon. I was told that Jenna had left THREE WEEKS ago and they wouldn't tell me where she went. I was DESTROYED (I mean, not really, but I was really unhappy). Then I flipped over the card and realized she wrote her cell on the back...SCORE! Turns out Jenna actually left the salon the day after I had my appointment!  It was FATE (or something..)\n\nSo anywho, ever since then (it's been probably close to a year now, I think?) I've been going to Jenna at Tony Moreno for Cut, Color, & Brows. We've changed up my style a few times. Every single time she gives me EXACTLY what I've asked her for. I've NEVER had a stylist who could do that for me in the past. \n\nThe salon is super clean, really cute, and I can't imagine even thinking about trying out a different salon. Not only is she a great stylist, but she gives RIDICULOUS scalp massages, and it's always fun to chat with her. \n\nOnce I stopped by for a bang trim, and Jenna wasn't in so Tony shaped me up. Turned out perfect! I've never had a full cut done by him, but every client I've seen him do has been amazing as well! \n\nCheck out Tony Moreno Salon - you won't be disappointed, I guarantee it!"
0,First let me say the food was great. I had a large group from out of town that wanted to eat downtown and I suggested hash hash a go go. When we went to settle up instead if asking for separate checks(pain in the @$!) I asked the waiter to apply cash a a specific amount on my credit card. He made a mistake and charged my card three times the amount. He fixed it and we left giving him a 20% cash tip. To my surprise the initial charge was taken/held from my bank and when calling the manager Leilani she was not pleasant. I am very patient and she interrupted me and basically said call your bank on Monday and they will release the hold. She gave the obligatory I'm sorry but was rude and said we hold 20% on top of the total regardless.. we left our server cash. If you are going to hire people in a management role hash hash make sure they receive empathy training because this manager was void of it! What if I really needed that money over the weekend? Not returning to this location.
0,"Village Inn, all the mediocrity of Denny's with a less creative menu.  Chain restaurants all have that corporate feel, and of course this Village Inn is no different.  \n\nI guess if you are in a pinch, this place will do...but if you really think you cannot look a little harder and find something better, then you really wanted to go to Village Inn in the first place."
0,"Three of us at in a southside office ordered BLTs with mayo in a takeout order this afternoon. For our $8 each we got a VERY THIN layer of VERY THIN bacon, no mayo, and bread that wasn't toasted. This was a lesson in how not to impress, and our return business is already lost. Fatheads and Primanti's have never let us down like this. If it weren't for this experience I would have gladly come by for a reuben or some of the other sandwiches (the menu LOOKS great), and a beer. Not so much anymore."
1,"Great food,  great service and a place to watch World Cup games at lunch time during work hours. I had the three taco platter with shrimp,  pork,  and beef.  All were very good.  The salsa at the salsa bar was a nice addition."
0,"This place seems to be only open for some financial technicality (this is not hyperbole), like the owner needs it to fail miserably to reap the tax benefit or something...\n\nLet me explain (if you're pressed for time, just look at the star):\nMy wife and I first visited not long after it opened, and it seemed to be going through some growing pains, many of which have been mentioned by other reviewers: a byzantine, mind-bending menu the length of an entire wall which you MUST view from a foot away... a ridiculous array of gadgets behind the counter to match the menu... laconic staff who appear not to know how to use said gadgets... a stupid-long wait for a HOT DOG. Even though it was lunch time no one was in there, which should have been a sign...\n\nANYWAYS, we were willing to give it another shot, but to hedge our bets we grabbed a Groupon so we would only regret $8 wasted instead of $16...\n\nSo a couple weeks ago we returned (mostly to use up the Groupon, which was nearing expiration), and something wasn't quite right; once again no one was inside, but this time that also included the employees...\n\nI had started noticing that there were paper signs plastered all over the entry doors, windows and menu, but just assumed it was some special they were offering... Then right as someone finally ambled out from the back, I started actually reading the \""special\"", which read something like \""ALL HOT DOGS AND COMBOS NOW $20 DURING REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS\"". As the ridiculousness of those words started to sink in, my wife asked the person who had wandered out \""Do you work here?\"" (could they be an employee? If so, how was one to tell? This dude looked like he had just stumbled out of a cot in the back room). \""Yeah...\"" he replied, which I didn't quite believe at first, scanning the restaurant for any other signs of life, \""But just to let you know, we've only got hot dogs now, and they're $20\""...\n\nThis was about the time that his words and the message on the sign started matching up in my brain (\""oh! they're SERIOUS!\""), while my wife started her own scan of the place, looking for the hidden camera crew that was surely waiting to jump out and tell us we were on a prank show...\nAfter my wife asked if they were going out of business, our disheveled host explained \""No one's in here because of the 'recent change'... The owner's rich... he doesn't care if anyone eats here or not. But no, we're not going out of business\"". \n\nI felt like we had suddenly entered the real playground of the rich, where businesses rise and fall on the capricious whims of multimillionaires... The owner probably had a bet with someone to see who could come up with the most ridiculous business model...\n\nConfused, but still hungry, we asked if we could at least use the damn Groupon... He held up his hands as if to say \""whaddya-gonna-do?\"" and motioned towards the cold lifeless machines behind the counter... \""There isn't any food ready because no one's coming in... I would just get a refund...\"" Suddenly I started feeling bad for this dude; whether he knew it or not (and really, who COULDN'T see it?), he was a dead man walking, just biding his time getting paid until this place closed down and became (gods willing) a Chipotle or Panera or something...\n\nSo, slightly dazed, we wandered back outside, where an elderly woman and her husband were getting out of their car. When he mentioned going to Bison Jack's, she said \""I made the mistake of going there once before, and I'm not doing THAT again...\"" as if he had just suggested eating at Crappy McCrapper's Poop Buffet.\n\nWe smiled at each other, wordlessly sharing the knowledge that Bison Jack's totally sucks and will someday soon be going out of business and losing some A-hole at least a portion of his immeasurable fortune.\n\nThen we went next door to Cosi, where they have pretty decent salads, friendly staff, and don't make you feel as if we had entered another dimension."
0,"I ordered a carne asada burrito and it was garbage! The carne asada tasted bad, thin and hard, just bad quality. Roberto's is not that great but it's better than this place"

1,"Great Indian food! I definitely recommend going for the lunch buffet on the weekend for a sampling of many dishes, especially if you are new to Indian food or to the restaurant. Some dishes are, of course better than others, but overall the food is quite delicious. I would imagine non-vegetarians would enjoy this restaurant as well, for it's bold, complex flavors. I was there around 2 on a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed, which is always a good sign!"
0,"This place is very overrated. The hamburgers and sides are way overpriced. Sure,  the fried egg option is awesome but the burgers do not taste that great. I went to lunch here with a friend and between the two of us it was $28+ dollars. Way too much money for a fast food  hamburger stand. For that price, I could eat at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar. The service here sucks too, I was gambling around 4AM and went up to the counter. The guy cooking did not even acknowledge me.  So I just left. There are way better hamburger places than this dump!\n\nLast great hamburger stand my A$$!!!!!!!!!!! --Very disappointed"
0,My friend got a tuna sandwich from here and after he ate it didn't feel so hot. Being wise and knowledgeable I knew better then to eat at this place. Sure glad I didnt have a sandwich. Fremont street sucks.
0,"This restaurant was a great disappointment. I have been to the Valentino's in L.A., but this place was nothing like it. Unfortunately, the service was very slow. After sitting down and waiting the longest time without even bread, water or even a menu, the bus boy came over and said \""my goodness no one has come for you yet?\"" We knew this was a bad sign. Especially so given the fact that the restaurant was not busy.  We kept an open mind for the food given the Valentino name, but again were let down. We had the tasting menu and wine pairing.  Maybe two items stood out, but overall the food reminded us of mediocre cruise food with all dishes rather bland and tasting the same.  The saving grace was the wine which was very good.  I can't say I hated the place, and by the end of the meal the friendly staff had redeemed itself.  But will not go back and will not recommend the place."
1,"Update: Did get a chance to try their gelatos. Tried the strawberry cheesecake gelato, as rated by another Yelp reviewer. It definitely did not disappoint. I originally rated this place a 3, but am upgrading to a 4 because of the gelato.\n\n\nOriginal:\nInteresting quirk decor. What's with all the black and red? Doesn't match the candy factory persona! Friendly staff. My family and I stopped by for lunch-- ordered fried Mac and Cheese, Angus sliders, chicken fettuccine, a factory burger and a bacon and artichoke pizza. We were late for brunch and were pressed for time so we were unable to get dessert.\n\nDownsides: long wait for food, and most of the food was just okay. Very expensive! All the food we ordered came out to around $90, and that's without drinks and dessert!\n\nUpsides: The fried Mac and Cheese and bacon pizza were the highlights. The tomato basil dip was tasty, and the pizza was light and not too greasy. Definitely gave me my carb fix.\n\nWould I go here again? Maybe not for the normal food fare, but I'll come back next time and try their desserts."
0,Came with my BF we started with the crab artichoke dip. It was very greasy and had virtually no crab. The wedge salad was good and crisp. I had the hazelnut crusted chicken. This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing.
1,"CLOSED - This was a nice comfortable place with good coffee, and I wish they had succeeded.\n\nClosed shop this past Wednesday (7/27) and the signage was down the next day - the fastest anything has ever happened in the Phoenix area... ever."
1,Delicious!!! We went for dinner this past weekend well done Jose Andres! \nYou will not be disappointed with with anything. Each flavor of the dishes are spot on. I highly recommend the shrimp and squid!
1,"Walking out of Albertsons at 6PM after scouring the isles for those few odds and ends needed for that awesome meal that i am planning on making and...well...We noticed the glowing lights of China Joy, we both did not want to sit in an establishment tonight so we grabbed a menu and noticed that they deliver. We rolled into the driveway and decided to take advantage of the delivery option. I am all about the sesame chicken and the wife wanted to be hooked up with the honey walnut shrimp. They give you a large white rice with every entree which is a ton of rice. The sesame chicken and the honey walnut shrimp have been moved into our top 2 for delivery or take out Chinese food.  I would have given the fifth star but i have not tried anything else there....Yet."
1,"The food is outstanding. Their hours are wrong, they aren't open on Monday's right now.\n\nEdit: They are now open 7 days a week. Increased the rating to 5, I love the food but I was very unhappy to drive there when they were closed. Hoping it doesn't happen again."
0,"The owner of this company, Steven Latsch, also owns a contracting business called SDCI, which we will be reviewing separately; this review is about our experience with Par Plumbing.  Mr. Latsch was out of town when we realized that his partner at SDCI, Daniel Cooney, had neglected to properly install our toilet in the master bathroom; that negligence resulted in very nearly bringing down the ceiling in our garage.  His employees were extremely rude and initially refused to contact him on his very important business trip (he left no one in charge while he was gone).  After threatening his employees that we would file another complaint with the Registrar of Contractors against SDCI, Mr. Latsch was finally contacted, and later that day he dispatched a plumber to the job site to fix the toilet leak.  A week later, when Mr. Latsch sent some SDCI employees to fix the ceiling, he tagged along and had an epiphany:  even  though the toilet Mr. Cooney installed was obviously leaking, it wasn't THAT leak which caused any damage...no, he insisted, the damage came from ANOTHER, DIFFERENT leak that SDCI was not responsible for.  When SDCI was hired to renovate our town home, a leak in the upstairs guest bathroom was discovered and most of the garage ceiling needed to be replaced.  Whatever leaks were present should have been searched for/discovered before they closed up the ceiling and assured us that our home was move-in ready.  Instead, the person who was fixing the cracked tiles for the  flooring subcontractor (CCFC)--who happened to be present on the day we noticed that there were enormous water bubbles in the ceiling which were about to burst--showed us that the toilet was leaking from the toilet ring.  What Mr. Latsch tried to say was that no water leaked into the floor/ceiling from the toilet...ummmm, then where did THAT water go????  So Mr. Latsch then proceeded to tell us that, out of the kindness of his heart, he had his employees fix a $2,000 leak for FREE.  The following week, Mr. Latsch didn't bother to show up OR call at the appointed time he was supposed be present for a follow-up inspection; nobody showed up at all.  We had to call him to remind him of the appointment HE scheduled, and he put us off until the next day.  When  will people like this realize that the CUSTOMER'S time is valuable, too?  And then he got mad at us because we didn't show him all of the respect he felt was his due for fixing his company's negligence \""for free.\""  Then he announced that he wasn't going to follow up on the leak, and told us to go ahead and file another ROC complaint or get an attorney to force him finish the job.  At that time, he was asked to leave, but he didn't do so in a timely manner...just stood there defiantly as though it was HIS decision as to when he should/would leave.  These people, and the subcontractors they hired to renovate our home, are unprofessional, unreliable and negligent.  Hire them at your own risk."
1,"\""Awww yeeaah!\""\n\nI know. I'm so out of touch with catch phrases and hip sayings. Ah well. At least I know a nice bar when I see one.\n\nVesper definitely treated us well as we chose this bar/lounge to kick start our evening activities during my BFF's '29 and still dayum fine' birthday weekend. Tasty, quality drinks in a beautiful setting with my bestie made for a fun evening."
0,"The Arizona State Fair has sadly been ruined.\n\nYou shouldn't have to work at having a good time. \n\nIt felt like my cash was hemorrhaging and that was just the beginning. \n\nI have been a fan for a very long time and never expected it to come to this. They have gone crazy when it comes to prices. I spent over $300.00 last night for 3 kids and myself. You would think that would have included tons of fun, but sadly it was not. \n\nThe atmosphere is sad and monopolized by individuals who act nasty/rude towards other guests of the fair. Sure you can come on wristband day, but then it's ridiculous lines of people for each ride. I purchased numerous ticket cards and two of them had to be reset. Are you kidding me!!!!!!! Hundreds of dollars on tickets and you can't even guarantee they are on the card. \n\nI hope they change the venue. It's self explanatory why this needs to happen. Also we saw the end part of the big fight and watched cops with a group of 50+ teens yelling/walking through the Fair grounds. One of the officers even had his tazer ready to use while escorting the suspects towards an exit. \n\nThe Arizona State Fair is not safe at night or welcoming. Please please please change your venue. I'm sure the Fair is saving tons of money by using that venue. However, you would make a ton of money at Westworld or something like that.  \n\nAgain 7 dollars for a 30 second ride or 5-6 dollars for a ten second game is wrong. No reasonable justification and no accuracy within your card readers. I have been to the Arizona State Fair more times then I can count. The price gouging that is going on needs to end and should even be illegal. \n\nI really hope they read these reviews and don't underestimate what is happening here. I can safely say that after this experience I will not be coming back to the fair. I have been a very loyal customer for over a decade, but it's just not worth it."
0,"I bought a Living Social deal here...and I think everyone else and their mother did too. I spoke with Cherelle, who was super friendly on the phone, and she said my reservation was for 6:15pm. We arrived around 5:30pm and waited and waited and waited! Finally around 6:20pm I asked a man handing out armbands (this is how they categorized you by flight manifest)  if maybe somehow I missed my name being called and his response was \""well, we're a little busy.\"" Really? OK, I can see that but I have a reservation. He told me I would get called soon. 6:45pm rolls around and I'm ready to leave. I walked up to the woman at the front desk and told her I wanted a refund because I couldn't be waiting around anymore--this was ruining my entire night. We had wanted to see a show after our helicopter ride and hadn't eaten yet, which we assumed we would have plenty of time since Cherelle told me total time there would be an hour. The ride is only 15 minutes for goodness sake! The woman at the desk told me they couldn't refund my money and she checked my reservation--it was at 8pm. At this point I'm boiling mad but trying to keep my cool. I told her I wanted a refund or to be on the next ride out. She assured me that I would be next and that she would give me a free DVD of our flight. OK, at least she offered me something for their royal mistake. However, we weren't called until after 7pm and didn't finish until around 8pm. The actual ride was awesome and if it hadn't been for the fact that my boyfriend was pretty excited about it, I would have just left earlier. We ended up missing the show we wanted to see (this was our last night in town) and just went out to dinner. \nI think this could be a great thing if they were more organized. Over-booking people and making them wait around for three hours just isn't acceptable. There were a lot of aggravated people in the waiting room and I really wouldn't recommend it. For the amount of time you're waiting...just try and get a window seat on your plane ride home. The view of the strip is almost as good as it is in the helicopter."
1,Love the red pepper hummus try the lemon vinagrette on everything its the best !
1,"Anyone with a history of heart related issues should NOT dine here!\n\nI've been to a number of chicken/waffle houses, and Lolo's can hang with the best of them.  The fried chicken has a good balance between greasy and juicy, with seasoning that isn't overpowering.  The waffles were fairly standard, but it's hard to really jazz up a waffle.  Add an ice cream scoop's worth of butter and syrup and you are good to go.\nThe mac and cheese was good, but not spectacular.\n\nThis spot is a little hard to find as it is on a very unassuming side street, so keep your eyes peeled."
0,"It sounded like a good idea to give Memphis another try yet again. Being from Kansas City, one of America's 4 BBQ capitals sometimes you get a craving for BBQ and nothing else will do. But the last couple of times my fiancee and I have went to Memphis it's sucked. Let's just do this...here we go. \n\n1: You call to get on the wait list. Then when you get there...you still have to wait even when people who came in behind you get seated first. \n2: Slow service. Seriously...I had to get my own kids menu from the front counter. \n3: Enjoy the bread. One basket is all you'll get. \n4: Take your time figuring out what you want to eat. Your waiter will be so slow you can reread the menu 5 times, heck pull out your phone and Google the owner's name, Mike Mills. You've got PLENTY of time! \n5: More lukewarm food. Seriously, it's a BBQ place. I'm all for slow cooking, but dang, put some heat in it before you bring it to the table, and I'm talking physical temp, not heat measured in scoville units. \n6: Where's the Magic Dust? It tasted good on prior visits, but our table was missing a bottle of it this time around. \n7: Spicy sauce. There's nothing like having to ask for and then finally someone brings out a clogged up bottle of sauce to show just how much the staff gives a damn about the product they're bringing to the table. And the spicy sauce was an absolute ******* disgrace that anyone who claims to know anything about good BBQ would never, EVER send to the table. \n8: Yeah, my tea is empty, and my plate isn't finished. Why yes, I would like a refill...oh wait, you're too busy flirting with the blond at the table across from us to even notice our empty tea glasses. Sorry guy, she was too cute for you and your chances of getting her phone number are the same as me winning Megabucks, Powerball, and MegaMillions in the same week. Ain't ever gonna happen. \n9: Onion straws. This dish should be labeled as a \""tribute to Crisco\"" dish. At least the table has a big roll of paper towels, perfect for spitting something back out. \n10: The brisket...was not bad, except for the fact it was cold. \n11: I think one of the types of meat was chicken. But if I was in front of a judge and had to say under oath what I thought it was I would have to say I honestly didn't know. \n\nThis visit was so bad I cringed at even leaving a 15% tip. I know the wait staff needs tips to make a living, but this was just bad. And I can't reward bad food and crappy service no matter how sympathetic I want to be. \n\n1 Star. And this time I gotta add Memphis to my Jackassery! List because yes, I think even having a Jackass kicking over a BBQ grill would still be an improvement over what was served to me tonight. \n\n(Yelp 100 in 2013 Challenge #17)"
1,"I originally came to Body Renewal from a BuyWithMe voucher.  I've been back 3 times since then because my therapist is the by far the best I've ever had. Tony makes you feel very relaxed from the start. Although the studio is quite small, it is decorated & lit in a way to provide a calming & peaceful ambiance to go along with the soft music in the background. \n\nTony is professional and courteous. He takes his time and knew to pay attention to where all my tension was built up without me saying a word. I like that he also used several methods of both massaging & stretching the muscles.  Very relaxing.  \n\nI almost want to keep it a secret so he doesn't get too busy for me. Either way, it's worth the wait."
0,"I wanted so badly to love Sushi Roku... but alas, poor service has ruined an otherwise wonderful restaurant.  But there's just no excuse for bad service in a high-end, expensive Vegas restaurant like this. Not when there are so many other amazing restaurants to enjoy.\n\nThe first time I came here, we were promptly seated at the sushi bar, where we just sat... forever... with nothing.. no drinks, no water, no menu. We looked uncomfortably around wondering if the restaurant was really even open yet. I finally had to awkwardly ask the sushi chef if we were supposed to order drinks from him (which is normally bad etiquette in a sushi restaurant, as the chefs only make the sushi). Finally a waitress showed up with menus and took our drink orders. And at some point later in the evening, those drinks finally found their way to us.\n\nIn sharp contrast to the incompetent waitress, the sushi chefs were AMAZING. We ordered several of the high-end specialty sushi rolls (at about $26 a roll), and what we received was as delicious as it was beautiful. My favorites were the Titan roll, which was like a piece of art, and the Katana roll. Everything was so fresh and tasty.\n\nMeanwhile, we finished our drinks and ordered a second round. Once again we waited.. and waited... and waited. Keep in mind, there wasn't ANYONE else in our section... the restaurant was not busy at all, the bartenders at the bar looked bored... yet we waited and waited and waited some more for our drinks. By now, we had already finished the meal, and honestly, probably even digested it already. Once again I had to awkwardly ask the sushi chef for help. Only this time I asked for a manager (after explaining to the chef that he had done nothing wrong!).  The manager apologized, and soon we had our drinks. But really, we didn't even care at that point because we were ready to leave. Then I was shocked when I first received the bill, as nothing had been comped, but later when the slip came for me to sign, I found that he had comped the drinks and some of the sushi, so at least there's that.\n\nIn our most recent trip to Vegas, we decided to give this restaurant another shot, since we liked the sushi so much. This time we sat at a table with a great view of the strip. I really liked the decor of the dining room, and felt quite comfortable there. But once again, the service disappointed us.  The first item we tried to order was the Oyster sushi, and were told they were out.  Next we tried to order the Spanish Mackerel sushi, and were told they were out of that too. Finally we ordered some rolls that they did have... and the waiting began again. As more and more time passed and we still hadn't received our sushi, I realized that this restaurant just has fundamental service problems. The waiter apologized and explained that sushi chefs were \""slammed,\"" but really, there's just no excuse for that when you are paying $26 a roll. We had tickets to see a show later, and I was starting to stress about whether we were even going to make it on time. I was also annoyed when the waiter gave us only a little bit of wasabi and ginger, to share, and then he even took that away partway through the meal!  I had to ask for more.\n\nI think this restaurant has so much potential, and I really do think the sushi here is very good. But bad service just ruined the whole experience for me. If it weren't for the great sushi and wonderful view of Vegas, I'd definitely be giving this restaurant only one star. Later in this same trip, we ate at Blossom in the Aria hotel, paid $20-$25 per entree, and had some of the most amazing service we've had in a restaurant. When you are in Vegas, you want to have fun and be treated like a king... and Sushi Roku just didn't do it for me. So disappointed."
1,"Yard House is probably one of the few restaurants that I truly love to visit from time to time and still won't get tired of their food. It's simply delicious! I've ordered the buffalo wings (for appetizers) and Maui chicken and everything was cooked to a different level. Although there were the rare times when some of their entrees wasn't as good, however,the awesome waiters will immediately take it off your bill. I don't know about some of the Yelpers, but Yard House is a definite yes for me. \n\nEat up and drink to your hearts' content people!"
0,Workers caused a hassle that would have made us miss a flight if we didn't attempt to return 3 hours early. When we arrived we had nearly a full tank. They didn't accept it and made us pay a very high gas refuel price. We went to a gas station and filled the bit up on our own because it was cheaper. Then they told us our mats were too dirty on the second attempt and quoted us a very high penalty. They should have told us upon the first return attempt. Now we had to go out again and vacuum.\n\nThey charge high penalties for minor infractions an the workers aren't sharp.
1,"I like their burgers. The food is cooked fresh to order. I have been inside once and the place was spotless clean!! I usually go through the drive through but it takes a long time to get the food. I guess it's because they don't make anything until you order it. I like the skinny fries but they sometimes have a funny taste, I think it's from the oil."
0,"I'm sorry but this place was awful. My boyfriend and I were very hopeful reading the reviews of others before we decided to try it out. First of all, the decor is awful and in desperate need of an update... From the pepto bismol walls to the green booths it's just not good... Food wise, we had the dinner combo of sizzling rice soup, pu pu platter (which tasted just like it sounds), and the flamingo chicken for the entree... It also came with fried rice and some other small shrimp dish which turned into a disgusting gelatinous goo (see uploaded picture)... The chicken had a nasty oily flavor to it like it had been fried too long and just doused in sauce to mask the flavor. The only decent thing we had was the fried rice which the rice was over cooked but ok... Service was mediocre... Our drinks NEVER got refilled and nothing but a sorry when they noticed we didn't eat hardly any of the food. $40 bucks later we left disappointed and disgusted. Never coming here again."
1,"Arrived in Vegas for the girls trip 2 days ahead of the ladies... gave me a little \""me\"" time to have fun solo which is always a nice change of pace... decided to stay at the Paris Hotel solo since I got a great deal on the room!\n\nArrived aroudn 12:30AM and of course there was no one else in line to check in... so checking in was fast with no complications. I knew my way around the hotel since I've been to Vegas before so that was a plus to navigate around the hotel.\n\nGREAT VIEW of the Bellagio fountains!\n\nWent up to my room on the 24th floor? I think lol... it was average and cute. Queen beds since I checked in late and all the king beds were taken. All the usual amenities: nightstand with clock, desk with chair and writing materials, TV, mini bar, tub, stand up shower, toilet, double sink, coffee machine, hair dryer etc... Nothing fancy but not lacking any simple essentials. The elevators to the hotel rooms and the parking garage are fairly close (for being in a Vegas hotel!) together so that was nice. Parking was always available. The hotel is clean, the staff is friendly, and I'd recommend this place for others to stay at.\n\n I've been up to the Eiffel Tower on my last visit with my boyfriend. Breathtaking view of Vegas! \n\nThe only negative I'd say... the walls are a little thin. By the time I got settled, gambled a little, and went to bed (tired after the flight etc)... a bunch of party goers came back to their room somewhere near me but it was SO loud... the walls should be thicker! That's the only thing I didn't like and that's enough to deter me from staying again BUT if you don't mind that then it's definitely a nice play to stay!\n\nCheck out at 10:30AM on a Friday morning was fast and easy."
1,"Gorgeous bar! The chandeliers are dazzling. Be warned if you're wearing a short dress or skirt going up in center elevator. Crap table players can see up ladies' dresses. It's funny, but very creepy."
1,"Went on Friday night, seemed like much faster seating than nearby Cheesecake Factory.  Had the ny strip and grilled shrimp ($22) with the crab and artichoke dip app. ($9)  The app came promptly with crustini bread.  It had chunks of blue crab on the top and a cream cheese base.  We ended up boxing most of it due to our entrees arriving so fast.  The steak was thin and juicy.  Mashed potatoes as a bed can never be bad.  Green beans were also flavorful, A1 added to make everything go down easy.  Grilled shrimp were a bit plain, I believe there were 5 of them on a double skewer.  Our server was very attentive and the all important iced tea remained mostly full."
0,"We always try to find a local business to support and found good reviews on yelp for Pat's Pizza Plus. Geez. I have no idea where the good reviews came from. The pizza had zero sauce on it, it was lukewarm upon pick-up and the salad was being stored on top of the pizza so it was lukewarm as well. We won't be trying this place again. We'll stick with Spinato's!"
0,"**Warning** Do not order the cooked food here except for burgers and pizzas. It is not edible!! I ordered a cajun jambalaya pasta, a shrimp scampi and their potato soup. Words cannot describe how awful they all were.... I sent back both of these entrees in exchange for a turkey sandwich  for lunch. I gave them two chances but I had to send back my food twice.\n\nThe Cheesecake factory in Riverside, NJ is waaaaaay better!"
1,Love stopping in here and picking up some of their unique and tasty Asian bakery treats. There are so many different types that you just have to come in and try them out. The bonus here is that they are all extremely delicious. Just the smell of those gems baking in the oven gets me excited.\n\nNice selection of both Sweet and Savory. You will find several items with different kinds of proteins stuffed inside or covering them. There is also a large selection of items for when you are on a sweet tooth adventure. They even make some good looking Wedding Cakes.\n\nNormally stop in after having lunch at the Thai place or one of the Soup restaurants in the plaza. Usually pick up a couple of those Green Onion Hot Dog sweet buns. Favorites also include any of the Spicy or or Shredded Pork items. The Coconut Taro and the Creamy Coconut are also a must.\n\nVery friendly Service and a Fun place to check out. You just have to use your best judgment and try not to eat too much. I'm starting to feel it in my love handles. It is just so good and addictive. Located in the front part of Mekong Plaza. ENJOY !\n\n4.5 STARS

1,"I don't go to the Strip that often, but this is quickly becoming my go-to place when I wanna listen to some upbeat music and people watch.\nThe drinks are decent, the hookah comes in some interesting flavors and it's always super lively on a Friday or Saturday night. Not to mention, the view of the Strip is cool and there are always drunken tourists to laugh at there.\n\nCONS: The hookah is cash only, which means that if you're like me and only carry cards, you will have to walk all the way to the ATM and pay the exorbitant $5.99 fee, when the hookah is already $30. Ouch.\nIf you want to sit outside, you will have to wait for at least 15 minutes and sit in the cramped indoor section until then.\n\nOther than that, I think Rhumbar is one of the coolest places on the Strip and I definitely plan on bringin' my best friend here when she comes to visit!"
0,"I didn't think this place lived up to the reviews at all! Pretty disappointed actually. I ordered the french toast and it was barely cooked! Lets say it was lightly seared on each side. Disgusting. And at $10 an order, very disappointing. My husband had the breakfast bowl and he enjoyed that, said it was a bit spicy though and he loves spicy food. For the money, this place is not worth it in my opinion."
1,The sushi was fresh and awsome!
1,I love this place - friendly staff and wonderful array of flavors available and really good mix-ins. I will be visiting this place again very soon!!!
1,I've been a faithful customer of Dolly Rockers for years and have always received impeccable service! Thank you Laura for always making my hair look amazing!
0,"This place is horrible!!!!!  The staff is everything you hope a staff would not be - think aggressive, rude, inconsiderate!  I wish Cassandra O. hadn't given them a 5 star rating, cause it severely skews what they deserve - but please take her review for only what it describes...the food!  I drive all the way to 24 Hour fitness just so I don't have to deal with these people.  Mind you I live less than a block away from LA fitness & I drive 10miles to work out at 24...I think that really says something.  If I could give them a zero star rating I would.  Its not even worth trying a week free if thats what someone is thinking.  Management should really read the things we write and consider some layoffs. \n\nPS (the assessment employee took my body fat % when I first arrived - before I had even decided to sign up - and admitted to me that they tell potential customers their body fat % is higher (about 10%) just to make them feel bad about themselves so they will sign up) BEWARE!"
1,Great home made grub.  Amazing burgers.
0,Just came back from this Urgent care and it will be my last ...and entire life of doctors visit this doctor Valerie Jaskowski was by far the rudest ubnoxious doctor ever ..I dont know how this women became a care person because she is certainly NOT ! I took my daughter for care there ...when my daughter came out she said she was not sure why she got antibiotics she didn't get a urinary test to see whats going on and first thing she open the door to the room she loudly asked in front of the staff if she has a VG problem and continue talking ...when my kid came out she was mad and she said this women is rear unprofessional ...as the dr walked out I confronted her ...after confirming what she said to my child she start yelling at her that she is the expert over so many years and she know better your not a doctor she keeps yelling at my kid my kid asked her so why did I pay 95$ for if I dont get checked and the dr replied to her very food ...because I charge what ever I want this is my fee for my services ...I looked at her and told to stop yelling and she needs to control herself ..your not very professional and this not how you talk to a patient dont care how old she is u need to inform her and have a better tone ......horrible ...some people should not be doctors !

They had none in stock.\n\nThe store itself was relatively tidy, though a bit strangely organized.\n\nTook me a while to find someone to help me, and then took them even longer to tell me they had nothing in stock, even though I started off the conversation with \""there are none on the shelf\"".\n\nThe employees were friendly enough, but the overall experience was meh, even for a Best Buy."
0,"I wanted to lovvvvve my stay here. I  booked 4 rooms with the most fantastic person in the world, the manager Louise, and everything went off without a hitch. The staff here is decent (except the shuttle bus driver...but I'll get to that). The hotel itself is clean and quiet for the most part, so if you're just looking for a place to sleep, you'll be happy. \n\nLet's start off with my least favorite person/people on the trip...The shuttle bus driver. The man does NOTHING all day. We were in a group of 8 and we asked for a shuttle ride 3 times and were denied 3 times. The first time, 2 people flew into the airport and needed a ride to the hotel, they called the hotel and they said that \""he didn't show up for work\"" but if they took a cab, they would be reimbursed. Well, that was nice and much appreciated by them. The second time we tried to utilize the shuttle was to take us to Hohokam, but the shuttle bus driver said he \""might be to busy to take us\"". Ummm, isn't that your job? I mean, to take people places. I was promised by the hotel that you would take us there...but you're too busy to do your job? That's cool...why don't you just keep sitting there eating breakfast ALL morning (I'll get to that...). The third time we needed to use the shuttle was to take 2 people to the airport the night that they were flying out. We called down to arrange and again were told that the driver didn't show up. Wow. Fire him! The whole 6 days we stayed there, I saw the shuttle van move one time. ONCE!!! \n\nNext up, breakfast. Anywhere in the Phoenix metro is going to be slam-jammed in March. Us baseball fans will pack your hotel, as a matter of face it will probably be at  100% capacity during March. If you offer breakfast, have enough food. Every single day, our hotel ran out of certain things. Little milk cartons, biscuits (they had gravy...the breakfast lady told me to use regular bread. haha. asshole), cinnamon rolls, bananas, pancake batter, sausage, bacon, eggs, etc. Those are just a few of the things they kept running out of while I was there for 6 days. One thing I noticed that the shuttle bus driver actually did well was (and probably what kept him SO busy) eat breakfast all morning. Yup, the same stuff that they were running out of, was being chowed down by the lazy ass bus driver. I can't stand a lazy person who just takes advantage of stuff. He's useless. \n\nThe pool at the hotel is small and doesn't look like it was cleaned in ages. I'm sure it was, but seriously I wouldn't even dip my toe in there, that's how disgusted I was. \n\nI booked 4 King rooms, but we only got 2 king rooms. The other two were queen rooms. Again, very disappointed that we all didn't get the rooms that were originally booked.  \n\nUmmm yeah... Sadly I won't be staying here again. Besides Louise, everything was a huge fail in my book."
0,"HORRBILE .. the name of this place pretty much sums up the experience you will have when dealing with the quality of staff, food, overall everything!  This place definitely earned its name TERRIBLES!!!!!!!!!\n\nI was forced to have brunch there with a couple of people that were in my group on my last trip to Vegas.  But now i know why i am so okay with paying $15 just for a salad at a nice place, because with the other more expensive places you are paying for the experience and service. i cannot reiterate this enough ... this place is rediculously horrible.  DOnt go ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

0,Don't think I'd come back- food was okay- very little spice. Service was poor.  Charged extra for black beans even though it was an option on the menu.  Took margaritas away before we were done.  Not sure what folks see in this place....I can get much better Mexican food in Chicago.  It gets two stars because the margaritas were good.
1,"Went for Happy Hour and was impressed with the selection of drinks and appetizers.  Right now they are running an extended happy hour through Labor Day (4-10pm).  They have a variety of mojitos and margaritas for $5.  We had the fish tacos and burger ($10 ea).  It is 2 tacos, each with a good sized piece of grilled fish and the burger comes with all the goodies, including fries.  Even though when we were there at HH on a Friday night, staff was pleasant and tentative.  A bit older crowd than some other of the  places in Scottsdale which was a nice change of pace."
0,"I decided to go with AZ Exterminating when a door to door salesman for the company was coming around my neighborhood and offering a discounted promotion for the winter months (bugs are barely out) I signed up for the quarterly  service as the guy recommended because and I quote \""you wont need more than that our chemical treats and remains active for longer than that. Since I signed up there have been several scheduling issues, the tech not showing up during the time frame he was supposed to etc. As long as he came that was not that big of a deal to me, I just want to the spiders gone. Well we got sprayed last time in April around the first of the month of so, I noticed recently there have been huge spiders all over the patio and even some in the house. So I called them yesterday and wanted to have them come out (they have a worry free guarantee if the bugs come back before the next spray so will they to take care of the problem) I spoke to the lady at the office on the phone and she said no problem at all she would have the tech give me a call to schedule when the best time to come out would be. About an hour later the tech called to schedule, I was so impressed when he said he could be out the next day between 730am and 8am. YAY the bug guy is coming to take all the bugs away. Well this morning (next day) I got up at about 7am and waited for him to show. I about 8:15am no bug guy (Frank is his name) so I send Frank a text asking if he is coming or running later. No response. At 9am I get a call from a lady by the name of Cricket telling me I have to upgrade to the bi monthly service in order to have him come back out because the chemical breaks down after 60 days. Are they aware a quarterly set up is 3 months, no 2?!? I said Cricket your tech was supposed to be here an hour and a half ago and you are calling to tell me that he's not only NOT coming, that in order to even get him out here at all I have to upgrade to have you come out every 2 months instead of 2 because the guy that sold me your business promotion last winter LIED to me when he said it would last more than 90 days? She had a little giggle and said well you must have been misinformed, we only offer the bug free guarantee if you are on the bi monthly billing cycle because we know the chemical wont last longer than that. BUT they are running a promotion right now so its only 75 instead of 90. SO UNPROFESSIONAL. I told them to cancel my service immediately and I would find a company that truly understands communication and customer service. If the tech should have never scheduled the service in the first place you should not have had him give me a call. GET IT TOGETHER. I will definitely be giving the manager Chris a call on Monday to find out what happened and how I was so misinformed. FIND A BETTER BUG GUY, these guys do not know what they are doing."
1,"Last minute costume brought us here. The incredible playground kept us there for a few hours. My 3 year old cousin ran through maze, climbed on the jungle gym and jumped in the jumpy thing. Lots of shops and lots of great places to eat. If you need a place to shop, eat or keep you kids entertained I definitely recommend Town Square."
1,"M&M world is pretty incredible as you might expect. They have so many options for color and flavors and peanuts and peanut butter and mixed.... It is mind-boggling. They have great gift ideas too for your friends who didn't make it to Vegas. As always, the single special-color M&Ms are expensive, but for some reason they taste better when you choose the exact hue of your chocolatey treat:)"
0,"I had gone and checked out an apartment here about a month ago. I looked at a one/one and was not impressed. For the quoted cost ($800 plus trash and basic cable), the actually size of the place wasn't so bad (I believe it was 750sq ft), but it smelled like mildew as you walked up the stairs and into the apartment. Plus the appliances and cabinets were outdated and grungy. It didn't seem worth the money. Not to mention there were pipelines and exposed wires in the bedroom closet. I settled on a beautiful 2/2 with patio and fireplace somewhere else for the same cost as Camden's 1/1."
0,"This is the worst theater I have been in a long time.\n\nUsually we go to the Orleans, Red Rock, or Suncoast.\n\nThis time we went to the AMC.\nBad decision.\nThe previews stopped twice. \nThe temperature was just lower than the oven that cooked our turkey yesterday.\nThe screen (theater 2) was also just larger than my 50\"" Tv at home.\nAnd the seats...\nI've sat on more comfortable,  broken, lawn chairs.\n\nNeedless to say I'll be staying home before I go back to the AMC."
0,"I am writing as the mother of the bride where we had 110 guests. The 5 to 6 pm reception was delicious and excellent in the beautiful atrium. The problem was the wedding planner was given the wrong diagram. It was for the square room when we were given the larger rectangular room.  At least two of the tables was missing a place setting.  No biggie, just get another place setting and we would be happy. Instead, I (mother of the bride) was missing my place setting and had to ask three times and wait 25 minutes. My sister had faster results because after the wait staff argued with her about how the table was not missing a place setting, my brother-in-law went to get one himself. \n\nThe salad and green tea sherbet were great. Our entrees were salmon and New York Steak.  I was extremely disappointed with my first experience with an Omaha Steak. It was supposed to be medium-rare and instead it was well-done and dry. The mashed potatoes were dried out and crusty. The sauce was great and a lot more of it might have helped.\n\nThe result after I wrote to the corporate office was that the catering manager called me. I do not think that she understood what I had to say. She praised her staff for how great they were and how they kept the water glasses full. Hello! I did not even get a water glass! I wanted to hear how that issue had already been addressed and would never happen again to another guest. As for the dry steak, she said that she tried one at the reception and it was excellent. Yes, I probably got the first one off the grill and then it was kept warm too long, as a result, it was dry. Her steak that she got at a later point would be great. Some of my guests did say that their steak was great. I would recommend that if you are having a wedding reception there, that you add 30 minutes to the actual time that you want your steaks so that they are not sitting in the warmer. The catering manager blamed the wedding planner for the dry steaks so you know that she depends totally on the wedding planner's schedule.  Regrettably, she is not watching closely to see if the evening is running on schedule.   I suggest that she should be flexible and in charge of  the time for the kitchen to start the entrees. The reputation of the restaurant is in her hands."
1,"Well, I do like to get my massage on every once in a while. I should probably go more but dont make the time. Massage Envy is a great concept for a few reasons.\n1. Its very affordable. First time visit is only $39. $39 for a 1 hour massage....are you kidding me? Thats awesome!\n2. Locations. They're everywhere. Hey, look....theres one now!\n3. They're legit. You dont have to feel shady going in and your wife doesnt have to wonder if you're getting a massage or a rub and tug!\n\nThe only thing that keeps me from giving a 5 star rating...they're a little pushy with the close. They have a membership and they push that pretty hard. Hey, I know when I need a massage, I dont need to be \""sold\"". If they could back off of this just a little, they'd be 5 star all the way."
1,"Tried Prommare's a few weeks ago and it's my new go-to for Thai food.  It's the best I've had in town and is always consistently good.  The lunch specials are cheap with very large portions.  My favorite is the Kang Ped (red curry) and Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles)... highly recommend them, but everything I have tried is delicious.  I enjoy eating in but expect it to take around 45 minutes because it's always crowded!"
0,"Blows!!! So fuckin unorganized at the door. You get inside and great a big fuckin square room. I've done bottle service here several times and even then it's such a hassle to have a good time. Plus the egos that all these douche bags have just cuz they are a bouncer at Jet, Big Fuckin Deal! The house room is the one redeeming factor."
0,"We decided to try this place because we were staying at Monte Carlo and got discount tickets from Tix4Tonight. (50% off main entree) \n\nFood wasn't great. I got spaghetti and it was soggy, but the portion was huge. Our waiter was friendly though. I wouldn't come here if I don't have a discount ticket."
1,A great local spot - and they support local rescues!
0,"I always like to start with the good so I will say that this place offers great people watching and the gawking factor definitely gets high marks. If you are looking to drink cocktails and view the work of Scottsdale's finest plastic surgeons, this is the place for you. If you are expecting a nice restaurant, not so much.\n \nWe arrived at the restaurant and it appeared that there was only valet parking available. At first we were ignored, but were finally informed that valet parking was closed. However, it was open to the BMW behind us. Thankfully we were not driving an old car or they might have called the police to remove our apparent poorness from the parking lot.\n \nWe stepped inside the restaurant where the DJ stands next to the host. Apparently this is a warning that loud techno music will inhibit patrons' ability to have a conversation. I told the host that we had a reservation for 7:30 pm and he said that it was for 6 pm and they couldn't hold the table that long. There was some back and forth here as I explained that someone from our party received a confirmation call from the restaurant earlier that day for the reservation we had for 7:30. In the end, the host was only a little condescending and that could be my fault because I didn't get the memo about this being a \""dress-up\"" kind of restaurant and arrived wearing business casual.\n \nAfter about a 30 minute wait, we were seated at a table so small that four of us were seated on the corners and we were so close to the bar behind us that every time a server walked by we all got bumped. Our server arrived to take our drink order and we, all 10 of us, were trying to get a look at the cocktail menu. We asked for an additional cocktail menu but were told there were no more.\n \nOur entrees arrived one at a time and every food and drink item was delivered by a server standing at the head of the table and yelling \""Who ordered the___!!\"" That was fantastic as we must have ordered 40 things between drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Considering the price of the food, I think I can reasonably expect the wait staff to remember to which position the food should be delivered.\n \nAs for the food itself, some things were good, like the tacos and the rock shrimp. Some things were really bad, like the ramen and the chicken mole. The portions were small, but this was expected.\n \nThere are some really fantastic restaurants in Scottsdale where you can get awesome food and excellent service. Also, you can generally get a viewing of the same beautiful people just about anywhere in Scottsdale. Go to the places where you can get the 3-in-1."
0,"I've been there for drinks before but hadn't been there for dinner until tonight.  My friends and I were starving and looking for a good fish fry and thought Mojo's would be decent.  WRONG!  There was one poor young woman who appeared to be having to cover the dining room and behind the bar by herself- I felt bad for her.  The soup/salad bar (which comes with the fish fry) was covered with flies, the lettuce and coleslaw were sitting in pools of water, and the soups were lukewarm and tasted like they'd been sitting on a burner all day. The fish was clearly prepackaged and just defrosted and thrown in the deep fryer- it was burned on the outside and cold on the inside and had a fishy smell and taste (fresh fish is not supposed to taste or smell fishy).  The baked potato was mealy and lukewarm as well.  I can't speak to the rest of the menu- it might be delicious, but you will definitely want to avoid the fish fry- we pretty much all felt like it was the worst fish fry we have ever encountered.  We are all just hoping we make it through the next 24 hours without food poisoning."
1,"Waited about an hour, and I say it was worth it.  We did have a party of 7, so it took longer for us to get seated.  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries which were really good, and the fried egg on top was the kicker.\n\nI got the Miyagi burger, and a couple other people got the crabby patty.  Burgers and service were good.  Will definitely come back when we are in vegas again."
0,"In town for a congress and not a fan of Vegas my friends stole me away from the strip for dinner, a happy hour drink and some jazz. We got to The Lady Silvia and it reminded me of a done up Mega-version of LA's Library Bar. \n\nThe decor was fancy-cheeseball. Gaudy nuveau-riche furniture and chandeliers, trying so hard to look expensive but you can tell its cheap furniture and decor. Done up Vegas style. \n\nThe jazz band was great, it made the uppity, snooty bar feel a lot less pretentious, more mellow and relaxed.\n\nOne star because the service was despicable. Two washed up ex-sorority sisters working the bar (a blonde and a brunette with fake boobs and melting cakey make-up two shades too dark) were being really snooty about the free drinks promotion and refused to give me and my girl friend the free drinks that were being given out FREE to EVERYONE as a promotion. WTF!!! The funny thing is, that as a social experiment, we sent my friend's boyfriend to ask for the drink and they just gave it to him no problem and no questions asked. Really?\n\nThank God for Yelp! And for cathartic ONE star reviews post shitty experiences!\n\nSuck it ladies!- (and I call them ladies cause I don't want to use the \""B\"" word, though I was tempted, with the immature treatment and terrible customer service received, after I had bought three drinks AND tipped)! Wish I could have gotten my tip back!\nOh well, at least I can leave this tip on Yelp for future Vegas visitors looking for a possible bar. Avoid this one. It thinks itself high and mighty and it's really just sad how hard it tries!"

0,"Now, I can put away food and I love serve but... when is enough? No line to wait (a plus), happy hour ( a plus) cold food lets talk. Bit into my Orange chicken and it was ice cold. My broccoli was also cold. So I ask for another. Guess what they went back and microwaved it up. Are you kiddin me. Please remake my meal. I'm not trying be difficult but if I pay for something I want it the right way? After a little talk with the manager then it was better. Damage was done. I give it two stars."
1,"We held a group event here the other evening - - and the staff was great! I didn't even realize that we have an OSF in Phoenix, and right in the downtown area. \n\nThe building was cool... a former house, I guess. But the interior was pretty cool, lots of small steps down and up every here and there. \n\nWe had a large closed-off area for our group. No issues with the timing of the food or anything, as we had a couple servers overlooking our party of 20. \n\nI had the lasagna - -which was great! For dessert, I think we all had the mocha pie (or something like that). It was awesome!\n\nI'll come back again another time with my husband. Good times!"
0,"I'm giving Chateau Nightclub 2 stars because I know that they have the potential to do much better.  \n\nThey play great music and there is an incredible view from the balcony, but I have to agree with other Yelpers that Chateau is poorly laid out and the lines and front door staff are unorganized.  I've been to Chateau 4 times since they've opened and am hopeful that the 5th time will be the charm!"
1,"I was pleasantly surprised. Didn't know anything about the cachet of the chef or signature dishes. After panicking briefly at the prices, my sister and I calmed down and resigned ourselves to the Vegas markup.\n\nAtmosphere - Looks like you're about to eat in a bar in the lobby of a casino, until you find the main entrance. Nice enough decor. Music too loud.\n\nService - Helpful and well-versed with the menu offerings\n\nDishes\nSashimi carpaccio - The reason this is a four star review. The Akami with garlic sauce was stellar. Toro was divine.\n\nHamachi \""Hawaiian style\"" (very slightly seared) - Great quality. Sauce was well-balanced.\n\nCrispy shrimp and salmon roll - Nicely done with the tride and true combo of shrimp tempura and avacado with a layer of salmon on the outside. Nothing you couldn't get at your local sushi purveyor.\n\nLobster spring rolls - Eh. Couldn't taste the lobster.\n\nDrinks - Nigori sake (can't really mess that up) and Cucumber martini. The drink wasn't overly sweet, but it was not to die for either."
0,"I can understand how this location can get some extra points for being quaint  but it will certainly not get points for being clean.  The soda I had was great but I could not get over how dirty and run down this place was.  The staff where inattentive and to be honest completely useless, the tile on the floor was pealing off, the bar looked very warn and the booth we sat in was sticky. I understand the concept but I cannot forgive dirt when I visited a location.   I won't be back again."
1,"WOW! \n\nthe bf and i had made reservations here before we were off to watch jersey boys, and everything from start to finish was fabulous. We were seated right away with delicious, fresh, warm, bread to snack on before our meal. coming in I knew i wanted steak, so i ordered the \""classique\"" since it's always better to be safe the first time, right? the steak is large but thin at the same time. the BUTTER on top omg, i don't think i've ever had steak like that before. it was goddamn mouthwatering. hats off to the chef for cooking it a perfect medium rare too. and the fries, wow. I am NOT a french fries person, but i ended up inhaling these thin, oddly cut fries. \n\nthe restaurant is gorgeous on top of the great service. I had requested to be seated on the patio, but because it's so cold these days it was covered up. No worries, the view of the bellagio foundation always looks good. \n\ni will DEFINITELY be back next time i'm in town."
0,"Two bathrooms are shared for men and women (yuck!).  And, it gets worse when a female sits on the toilet in the bathroom where a urinal shares the room and you look across to the mens urinal and see an inch think of urine collecting in the corners floor. It makes you want to puke!! And in addition, the urine from the urinal has splashed onto the glass case that stores the toilet paper. There are NO seat covers so you end up wiping down the toilet seat yourself, gross!!!  \n\nAnd after I spoke with the Manager , Leslie, she mentioned to me that the other restroom has no urinal....so make that one the Women's bathroom and save women from the view of the urinal and the urine on the floor and wiping down the toilet seat. In addition, Seat covers would be a plus for sure!!!!!\n\nI was really enjoying the ambiance, food, drinks and that good ol local feeling till I saw the urinal collection in such a nice neighborhood hot spot.  Leslie....you really need to clean those bathrooms more ofter before a health code violation comes your way, NO JOKE!!!\n\nClean up your act!!!!  I will not be returning back, bummer. But (and that is a big \""IF\"" I would prefer to go into a women's ONLY bathroom!!  Postinos (right across the street) should re-think their bathroom situation as well."
1,Awesome place for buying used bikes
1,"It's one of the many restaurants on the Luxor to Mandalay Bay shopping indoor strip, they have some pretty nice ones here. It looks great and it's pretty big with different sections, behind every curtain and door there are a few more tables. Sat at the bar and ordered the Smoked Whisky Cola that I've seen in a commercial. You get to talk to the guys and girls at the bar, they are very knowledgeable and friendly. They make a lot of smoke in a crystal skull and infuse that in your whiskey drink. so your cocktail will taste like incense smoke and you'll drink it. It's a little too strong at first but after a while you get used to it and it's great! My second drink was a Japanese whiskey which was good too. Wifey had a some fruity drinks that tasted too much like cucumber to me, but she liked them. Great Vegas style spot, great drinks and excellent service that leave you with a great felling!"

1,"I stumbled on this place purely by accident but what a happy accident. The place is cheery and inviting and most of all clean. The food is delicious and all homemade and the price is right. I've been back 3 times in one week if that tells you something. The homemade chips are incredible and the burgers are exceptional. The burgers are made to order in what they call BYOB (build your own burger). I also have tried the pastrami sandwich and the pizza and both were great! I wasn't sure about the pizza because I'm an ex-NYer but it was terrific. All three times there the cost for the lunch or dinner for myself and a friend was around $16 including the tip. There is also a nice case full of home made baked goods that looked great but I only tried the oatmeal cranberry cookie. It was great. I'll be back to sample more!\n\nWhat makes this place even better are the people that work there. Absolutely friendly and really out there to make you a happy customer. The gal behind the counter, Cheryl, is extremely friendly and professional and each time I visited I felt a personal welcome. The Devil's Kitchen is quickly becoming one of my favorite spots in Chandler and I feel tickled to see this business grow and thrive. It definitely has become my all time favorite place for burgers! Keep them coming!"

0,"Requested a fountain view room in the Augustus tower 6 months in advance and still didn't get it. Currently looking at a bunch of run down buildings inside Caesars. Disappointing to say the least...your \""checking in\"" system for first come first serve views is ABSURD. I can request a view 6 months out but someone who books yesterday and \""checks in\"" before me can get it the same way? That's ridiculous.\n\nEdit after stay- bath tub blowers were broke as well as a lamp switch that didn't allow one of the bigger lamps to light. \nAlso was unaware that the resort fee doesn't include wifi as we were tried to be charged $15 per day for wifi! This was free for us when we stayed at the Cosmo 2 days prior to this stay. We'll definitely just be staying at the Cosmo for our whole trip next year."

0,"Zero stars if possible.  The management here stinks.  I have been going to Embassy for years and this is one of the worse places to go.  I have stayed here in the past and recently, was told that my room was no longer available (after I told them we would be arriving late, not once but twice) and still my room was gone.  Was giving another hotel at their costs but the room for this other hotel was so bad, it would of been better I slept in my car.  I complained to Hilton Headquarters as I am a long time Hilton Honors Member and said that management would call.  Management for this Embassy never called.  I was told later by varies folks (other hotel and clerk at Embassy and also corporate) there was more then one complaint and also found out that this Embassy tends to overbook.  Please at least send us to a hotel has was comparable to Embassy and not one that has bad reviews.  Never will I stay at this hotel...I will find something else...I suggest the DoubleTree Downtown...they are MUCH better and less expensive."
1,"One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh!   You cannot go wrong here.  Very extensive beer menu, great sandwiches, and wings.  Could be my favorite wings of all time with a great variety if flavors.   Sandwiches are fantastic as well.  Many many beers to choose from.  What more could you want?"
1,"The hubby & I go there very frequently now...addicted to the margaritas!  We've tried more of the menu and it's ALL been great.  We like to share the giant burrito (yep, it's huge) that's loaded with only with a really tasty shredded beef (I hate rice and beans in a burrito) and covered with a delicious red sauce. We always sit outside since the inside is so blah, but it's so hot right now, we'll have to wait til it cools off a bit.  We'd get it to go, but we HAVE to have their margys!  The guys behind the counter are awesome and very friendly."
1,"Nice crispy crust.  Came here the other night and ordered a pie at the bar, with a couple of beers.  Definitely  an Old Town Scottsdale institution.  Their calzone looked pretty good, and enough for two people, unless you were the 135 lb guy sitting next to me, that scarfed down the whole thing himself.  I mean if he ate it all, it had to be good.  They also have some pretty good local beers on tap and by the bottle.   I'll definitely add this  my repertoire of AZ pizza haunts."
0,"Their customer service was a no star rating...  Went in with friends and we're ignored.  Had to ask for menus as well as water to start. We saw a sign saying \""$15 minimum purchase required for credit cards\""  we made a point in asking our waiter if that included debit as well...  He said it did not. We ordered our food and only had three people in our party...  They had served at least 6 people who had come in after us.  We were left waiting an hour.  I had to raise both hands to get the attention of a waitress.  After telling her we had been waiting for an hour she got us our food right away.  When paying for our bill the cashier said that debit card is included in minimum payment of $15 \n\nPho and the spring rolls were very delicious which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one lol"

0,I went to this location one other time and have went to the Ahwatukee and Mesa location. Which I love. Well last night I went here. I waited a hour for a table. Which I am fine with. But the service was terrible. The people next to us stopped the mgr and asked could he take their order. He did but when we asked the same thing he said he would be right back. No one came for 30 minutes. So now we were there for almost 2 hours with nothing ordered. Once we did order they served me the Shrimp Veracruz with store bough tortillas. I asked what happened to the homemade. I was then brought homemade but told for my particular meal THE OWNER said to serve store bought. Really? My dish is the most expensive item on the menu. So why skimp. The food was good but the service was terrible. Also my friend never got his taco. Our server acted as if we were an inconvenience. No worries because I will NEVER GO BACK there.
1,"One word can describe the food: YUM!  We have been researching some vegetarian restaurants lately and this is a real find.  We ordered the Spring Rolls for an appetizer and it was delicious.  My partner commented that it's the best one he's had.  For the main course, we ordered \""Chicken\"" Egg Foo Young and he got the Sweet and Sour \""Chicken.\""  My Egg Foo Young was very tasty.  It has to be the best one I've had.  The egg has a nice crunch and the inside is very moist.  I just loved the texture and the sauce was perfect.  I couldn't finish the plate because it was huge and I was full but was tempted to eat the leftovers.  Good thing my partner stopped me from eating the leftovers.  He had the Sweet and Sour \""Chicken,\"" and it was also tasty.  He commented that it was too sweet but it definitely was good when I tasted it.  As everyone has said, it is a hole in the wall.  It is located in an old strip mall.  The owner, Ping, was always smiling and courteous.  Overall, if you have restricted yourself to eating vegetarian or pescatarians like us, this is a definite place to try."
0,Bleh. Meh. Pff. Overpriced low-quality diner food. Think Denny's quality with a 300% markup.
0,I would give a zero but I can't I bought alot of glasses from this location and not one pair is correct just took my glasses in for repair and still broke now with a huge scratch on the lens all the have been doing is changing management and screwing there faithful customers I am really angry and upset like I said if it was possible I would have given you a zero for workmanship and how you treat your customers
1,"We are originally from Chicago and are hot dog people so we were excited to try a hot dog dive.  We had 3 different specialty dogs with locavore's, The Chicago, Mexican, and Italian.  All were great even though I was disappointed that there wasn't an open fire charring the hot dogs.  The Chicago was close and the other two were very good except that they were out of guacamole for the mexican.  I would definitely go back if I can get downtown during mid-day."

The drinks and service was excellent. \""Carlita\"" the cashier/waitress/bartender was awesome! She made the place. $4 for caddy margarita & $3 draft Modelos tasty & a price can't be beat. \nStick with the drinks and burritos. Stay away from the sopapillas and the posole.

The lady that was supposed to serve us got our drinks once and never came back to check for refills we had to get other waiters to get us more drinks.  We wanted to try this buffet going off the ratings and reviews on here and also spent more at this buffet than any other but were very disappointed with it. Studio B at M Resort and Wicked Spoon at Cosmo way way way better food and service."
0,"I'm not really sure what happened to this place. There's been a LOT of drama between the new owners and the staff lately, and all the good staff members who have busted their ass for a long time are being fired, and the ones who remain are also on their way out the door, or at least terrified that they too, will lose their job in the next week.\n\nSad. It was a good place, too. A new paint job inside won't change the fact that the owners are shitty to their staff, and in turn the restaurant suffers."
