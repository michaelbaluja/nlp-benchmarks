1,"This place is not a luxury mega resort and it has no casino. After saying that, it's actually not that bad. Pretty cheap. Good value for what you get. Can't complain. Staff is nice, friendly and helpful. Free breakfast was cool enough. And the place is clean with really comfy beds. I'd come back again."
1,"I had a taste for some sushi and the hubbs and I decided to give this place another whirl!  This time; however, we went the take-out route and I was not disappointed!! Our food was steaming hot, fresh, and tasty!  The sushi was, once again, right on point and we got extra fortune cookies!! Win!\n\nI can honestly say this is my new favorite Chinese food restaurant! It's super convenient, the staff is very friendly, and it's economical (especially when hubby decides he wants shrimp AND beef in his fried rice).\n\nCheck it out if you're passing by (better yet, invite me along)!"
1,"I have been coming here for years. My wife works right up the street so we head here for lunch when we can. I love the Chicken En Chipotle, it is spicy and full of flavor, but don't order it unless you can stand the heat. The tacos are solid too and the wet burritos are great. It can get busy at lunch so be prepared. It seems like most of their biz is during lunch. Maria is one of the servers and is a gem. Be nice!"
0,"The worst coffee I have ever had! Poured from a pitcher sitting in the fridge, watered down and coffee grounds?! I had to throw it away after gagging. This should not be served to the public. WARNING don't waste your money!"
0,"This place is outrageous, i had a party of 10 people and we were the only ones in the place. The owner i presume takes our order but decides to NOT WRITE it down so he doesn't mess it up the order. instead he just tries to play it by memory.\n\nwe wait at least 30 minutes before we get our food, and of course when the food comes out its all the wrong order. the FOOD its self was a very small portion I had the beef and lamb Schwarma which was dry and not enough meat was put in. i paid $2 extra for fries and received literally 7 fries, i counted.\n\nand even when the guy messed up the order and we told him and he still billed us the wrong items. HORRIBLE service, FOOD is over priced. DO NOT GO."
1,"i wasn't in an objective frame of mind, given that i was a visitor from another state and was willing to try just about anything local. that said, this place left a smile on my face.\n\nmaybe it was the 1950s-era big neon sign out front. maybe it was the fiberglass horse on the roof. maybe it was the kitchy old-school cowboy-themed decor inside. maybe it was the fact that our waitress wore a holster and 6-shooter. or maybe it was the sawdust all over the floor.\n\nside note: sawdust? really? WHY? aren't they concerned about people slipping and hurting themselves?\n\nwe ordered breakfast and it was good. it's hard to screw up eggs, hash browns, and bacon, and they didn't. yum.\n\ni'm glad we didn't go to IHOP."
0,"We had my son's 8th birthday party here, and spent 500 $ for 13 kids package for laser,  pizza, and video cared  and two adult trays of food, and 3 extra game cards for little kids. You would think that for that much money, we would have great service, however, my husband and I were disappointed. First, it started that when we came in, our reservation was not correct, we had made changes the day before and moved the time up 30 minutes, however, this was not passed on to the staff and it took 15 minutes for it to finally get done. Then when we went to sit down at the table, we only had one table for 16 kids and adults. This was appalling, since we had confirmed that we had 16 kids total, and that we would have food for the adults as well. When the 4 pizzas were put on the table, I asked about the other two trays for the adults and they brought it out, but had NO WHERE to put them, so I asked about putting it on the table next to us , that way we could get seating, but of course that was taken. finally the host put out a folding table in the corner , squeezed in where the food was put down. We had over 14 adults with no seating, just standing, and this was not to our liking at all. For our sons' birthday parties, we always like to accommodate adults with food, drinks, and SEATS, but this was not the case this time. Very disappointing, my husband and I have had parties in all the major venues, D & B, Amazing Jake's, etc. and this was totally a disappointment, especially for the money we shelled out.  \n\nOn their defense the kids liked laser tag and the arcade games were fine (too expensive though), however, we did not have ENOUGH SEATING for a party with 16 kids and their parents...\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Enlarge the party area, do not book two tables back to back, that is very uncomfortable and frankly, rude\n2. Have two hosts for each part, our host had too much to do and slowed the party down\n3. Have some parties in the front area where the seating was, that area was totally empty"
1,"Finally an amazing Pinoy restaurant to call our own!!!\n\nwe came here on a cold december saturday night, and literally ordered half the menu, it helps that we were four :)\n\nI've had many Filipino friends over the years and whenever I ask them about Filipino restos they all seem to back track and give some sort of excuse why there isn't any... y'all liers, I've seen them all over the place in San Diego, San Fran and LA :P thrppp\n\nI read somewhere that they serve ramen burger here, yeah the new fad of the moment... don't order it, it's over rated, the ramen patties are too filling, and it really doesn't jive well with the meat patty, I don't get it, actually it's down right gross. I think all ramen burgers are gross not just this one.\n\nBut the rest of the stuff we ordered was amazing!!!\n\nwe had fried chicken wings, pork ribs, sisig, chicken and pulled pork tacos, pork steamed bun, and some rice dish i forgot the name...\n\nThe fried chicken wings are the best I've had in a while, they are fried and then caramelized in fish sauce. The fish sauce is very mild you don't smell it but it gives it a nice salty finish and makes it yummy wow!!!\n\nNext, the tacos, the chicken were fried a la KFC minus the bones, it had pickled carrots and daicon radish, it was so good. It was the same with the pulled pork. The taste is well balanced with sweet salty and tangy.\n\nThe pork bun was good, it had hoisin sauce, anything with hoisin is good. The bun was fresh and soft, but with all the other dishes we had, this one was lost in the mix.\n\nThe ribs were amazing, caramelized with sweet soy sauce, served on a bed of garlic mash potatoes. It went very well together. The ribs were tender a little on the sweet side but the mash counter very well with that. The sauce was so amazing I kept on putting it on my rice :)\n\nThe sisig is a hot sizzling plate of pork, and they crack an egg on it and mix it in. The eggy taste didn't really add anything to it I thought. It was a bit salty even with the egg, but it is served with white rice so that was fine.\n\nMy amazing find of the night was a rice dish, it was called Bicol express. It had coconut milk and shrimp paste in it. The rice came in a large bowl with some pork meat and long beans, on top is a spoon with hot sauce and shrimp paste that you mix in. Now shrimp paste is an acquired taste, but I love it. Overall I thought it was a bit toned down, I think it could use a bit more shrimp paste, it was too mild for me it needed more salt. The marriage of coconut milk and shrimp paste is heaven. It was delicious and fragrant, I've never had it before and I loved it. I think this was the most Philippine dish of the night aside from  sisig. next time i will ask for more shrimp paste though.\n\nIt was a great experience, for those of you who want to try something new this place is definitely a good find. Even though it's on victoria near Van Horne (metro plamondon), the place looks very trendy and clean not like the neighborhood wink wink. I think we are sorely lacking in Philippine cuisine and this is a gem. They have been opened only 7-8 months, and the place is not that packed yet, so go before you have to line up out the door!!!\n\nPrice wise it was about 25$ each with tons of food and a drink each, it could have been less if we hadn't ordered the 14$ ramen burger... It's sooo cheap for food this good :)\n\nSalamat ;)"
0,"The steaks we had were good if a bit overpriced. I've had a better baked potato at Outback steakhouse (and yes, you can tell the difference between a baked potato and a boiled potato!). Our waiter was awful! He had no people skills and was almost rushing us through the meal ( really dude, its a Monday night, and half the place is empty). The saving graces for this place were: the caramel apple martini (absolute yumminess!, and the hostess (her name was Helen) who was very nice over the phone when I made reservations and when we got to the restaurant. She also spoke to us on our way out. She embodied customer service, which can sometimes be hard to find on the strip. Thank you Helen! I think I would have rather saved the $150 we shelled out on this place, and eaten elsewhere!"
0,"This place is seriously a poor example of how not to prepare, as well as serve Mexican food. I should have ran when I saw a hot dog on the menu, then got served small portions on a plastic plate. The food was simply horrible, and my date said her tacos (while chicken) tasted like fish. I had enchiladas, and they were the incorrect meat combinations I had ordered. Not only that but there was no flavor and it was also salty. I returned our overpriced dishes, paid for our beers and drove home-- only to get sick along with my date the following day! seriously!  I have doubts about the cleanliness of their kitchen. Is the cook washing his cutting boards properly? Mixing meats? ..... Won't be back in my lifetime. \n\nThe only redeeming thing about the experience was that our polite and courteous Waitress was well versed in the procedure of returning their sub par pseudo mexican dishes to the kitchen.\n\n** Note to the owner:   Even IF a meal was comped , I don't think Id be back. I appreciate the response, saying your kitchen is clean. Perhaps both my girlfriend and I just endured a rare occurrence ; but the food wasn't good either.  I think it's time for a new kitchen staff, and probably new guidelines on how to prepare or store meat.  Just my two cents ; because I never get sick from food - this was my first time in 10 + years. And if you get me sick, you can bet your bottom dollar I won't be back."
1,"I have been here many times, but not recently so I didn't feel like I could review it till I had been back.  First off great chips and salsa!  I have never been disappointed with anything I have had here...the big and little ass burritos are great... I have also had the chimichanga, tamales, and street tacos.  All were very good.  My only complaint was the service this time... extremely slow at lunch time.  I understand lunch rush... believe me I do... but you can't leave your table sitting for so long without coming by.  It took forever for anyone to initially come to our table and then she just disappeared.  It was kind of hot out and we were on the patio baking away.  I am being generous with the stars because you should really give it a try.  I am certain that the service issue was a fluke."
0,"Save your money and go to Olive Garden.\nYou will get the same quality and \""interpretation\"" of Italian without  the feeling or regret after spending so much.\n\nThe Linguini with clams was in a pool of butter and oil, but the pasta was all stuck together.  It should be illegal to call a pizza of such quality a \""Margarita\"", with its flat pita bread crust, thick rubbery cheese and no basil in sight.  \n\nThis place highlighted all that is wrong with Americanized Italian food.  Greasy, heavy, over cheesed, and over cooked.\n\nThe one star is because they had really comfortable chairs."
1,"The pulled pork is phenomenal, and the Brisket is tasty as well. To top it all off, the staff is happy and friendly."
1,"Wow!  What a selection!  The veggies and fruits were just gorgeous and reasonably priced.  A large selection of 'real' food... not all this froze and canned stuff.\n\nI love all the herbs and holistic alternatives they offer.  It's a wonderful alternative to the big \""chain\"" grocery stores.  Not a place to buy toilet paper... save that for Walmart!  If you're looking for a store to add quality and value into you life, then Sprouts is the place to go!"
0,This location is closed. :(
1,"This place is the perfect location for drinks before/after a show at the Overture! I wish they were open when I used to live down here. There's a pool table, and the place feels very spacious. I wish they had more sofa-like seating though. I can imagine people playing board games down here."
0,"Don't waste your time. Overpriced, boring, and full of drunk grenades. Customer service is awful. \n\nMy buddy and I decided we would go since they were offering free cover before 11pm. We arrived 10 minutes after 11, and although our whole party had arrived, they still charged 7 to walk through the door. We decided we would just go to Mez or Kazbah so went to leave. A friend came out and begged us to stay, so we decided to bite the bullet and pay cover (the last time we had went it sucked so we were apprehensive).\n\nWe went to the line, and the manager said he wasn't letting people in for a minute. We had already been carded 5 minutes before but he decided to make us wait and be ID'ed again. 15 minutes goes by as they are checking in more and more grenades from the VIP line, and then we are finally let in. \n\nWithin 5 minutes my friend and I had dropped over $30 on 2 drinks and cover. The wait at the bar was another 10 minutes. My 3 goals entering the bar was beer, shot, bathroom. I completed my mission at 11:50, 40 minutes into my one and only Saturday night of the week. What a waste of time.\n\nThe music was awful, Rod Stewart, really?? I didn't hear one song that I haven't heard a million times before. We retreated to the smoking area, the only part of the place I found bearable. There was an amazing amount of girls that could not hold their liquor acting trashed out there. Not normal trashed, more like first-time-I-ever-drank-so-I-decided-to-chug-a-bottle-of-everclear trashed. Words of wisdom: No one wants to do you if you are a puke time bomb.\n\nWe asked if everyone wanted to go somewhere else for a drink and dropped Kazbah as an idea and a girl walks up with the heaviest accent ever and says \""Kaaazbuh? Eww, isnt thAt a PUURSHUN place?!\"" ...... that sentence sums up my recommendation. If you have an aversion to 'PUURSHUN' places, please keep the rest of uptown fun and go to Whisky River! Otherwise, don't waste your time."

0,"Well  I don't know what Kind of sex they've been having, but I've never had sex that Bad!\n\nHonestly the worst Carrot Cake I've Ever had!\n\nServed in a big thick square, no layers, no filling, it had the consistency of wet packed sand that was thinly covered with a flavorless white frost and sprinkled with toffee chips and topped with a soggy strawberry.UGH!\n\nI'm so glad I didn't have lunch there, and now I never will.\n\nIt was also just a weird vibe walking in there, it's located in the same shabby courtyard as the country cottage, but had no class.\n\nTo the right as I walked in was a dimly lit area that looked like a ceremonial orgy room with a shrine to the God awful cake...WTF...\n\nThere was about 4 or 5 dark haired wannabe Italian guys running around acting like waiters.........is that supposed to be a turn on to get you ready for the non-climactic cake........I think only Pasta Brioni can pull that one off but barely.\n\nSo I took 2 bites and threw it in the trash, said thanks for nothing and called my husband to tell him he had NOTHING to worry about!!\n\nFYI...if your sex is so bad that your are resorting to that cake.....GOD HELP YOU!"
0,"*shudder*- It never feels good to spend a hefty sum of money only to feel ripped off and disgustingly unhealthy. That's what has happened the two times I've been here. \n\nMy fish tacos? Cheap ingredients. Super bland. My boyfriends burger? Huge patty, tiny, cheap crappy bun. The fried  mushroom appetizer we got was a HUGE joke. They came on a tiny paper bowl thing , about 3/4 of a cup of them to share between four people. And they were gross. The French fries are the SALTIEST you will ever taste. Hmm, I wonder why that is? Maybe so you'll be likely to Order more BEER? Blech. \n\nPrices are ridiculous. Service is just okay. This place is an abomination."
0,Headed to Vegas to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary and husbands birthday. With Michel Jackson tickets in hand for Monday and dinner reservations at Mixx on Tuesday to celebrate our big day we were pretty excited to get away.\nBooked reservations at Mandalay Bay so I don't know how we ended up at The Hotel but the check in girl made it seem like we were being upgraded so we we went with it.\nI have to agree with another couple of reviews regarding the smell. There is an obvious sewage problem that carries throughout the hotel once you leave the casino floor to the lobby. As you walk through the lobby hallway it's all anyone noticed and I'm surprised it's in another yelp review dated a month back and it's still so bad. It's definitely unappealing. Our room was clean and nice although only 1 pillow and 1 towel for each of us.The biggest problem is the building next door about 5 floors down has huge fans on it's roof that apparently never shut off.\nI noticed how loud they were( think helicopter hovering outside window) and on our way to the show talked to check in desk and confirmed that fans ran 24/7. Requested a different room and could not be accommodated because the hotel was booked. No apology just too bad so sad attitude. If I had known that I was paying 300.00 to not sleep all night I would have stayed elsewhere. \nWe were so annoyed we ended up checking out the next morning and skipped spending our anniversary there. Too many other options in Vegas to spend my hard earned cash here.
0,"Our waitress was pleasant and attentive, and the decor is nice, but the food is TERRIBLE.  The guacamole is fine, but the  tomatoes seem to have been bought prechopped in giant bags  from a mega food service company.  I ordered the mushroom enchiladas which has NO chile sauce and seemed as if they had been warmed in a microwave.  They were dry and flavorless and the mushrooms were room temperature, as if they had been cooked the day before and reheated.  The \""papaya-pineapple coleslaw\""  had no papaya and no dressing -- just dry cabbage with some shredded cilantro, a few cubes of jicama that tasted like the back of the fridge, and some sad pineapple.   My daughter, who is six, methodically picked the chicken off of her taco because it was so tough and dry that she couldn't eat it.  My husband got a vegetarian entree with black beans which was underseasoned and flavorless and which featured mostly those dreaded , bland, pre-diced tomatoes.  Had we not been the guest of a friend and on a tight schedule I would have sent most of our food back.  Don't waste your money here.  I've eaten in many upscale Mexican restaurants as well as in numerous little family run places in Mexico.  This food is not Mexican, and it's barely edible."
1,"LOCATION:\nHonestly I've been to CSN soooo many times and I've never notice this EVER. Its located in a building which houses a food court with other mom&pop pop-up spots like Kaba Curry and Wing King (both I've yet to try) and more. They really should market to the college students. I mean their right there in walking distance. \n\nFOOD:\nSeafood soon Tofu soup TO GO: \nnot sure if it was because I was to go, but I felt even after I told her SPICY, my soon tofu soup was very watery. Don't give me wrong it was delicious! Very flavorful and very hearty. Just different than what I'm used to. The seafood soon tofu soup came with a lot of seafood, again more than im used to. I was actually surprised how many mussels I had in mine. Overall good soup just watery. \n\nSERVICE: \ngreat service, the women that takes your order (I presume also owns this little hole in the wall) was very sweet, she even told me for next time to call and order ahead since she figured I was there on my lunch break (since I was in scrubs). Very sweet of her. She reminded me of those old Korean grandmothers who just wanted to feed and feed you. I'm not complaining. :)\n\nDefinitely coming back to try their Korean BBQ. maybe then I'll give them 5 stars"
0,"I have heard from so many places about how this is supposed to be the best thai food this side of (insert thai city here), but my friends and i left very disappointed.  We shared the satay which were good.  The pad thai was really disappointing.  My bf and i also had the thai fried rice and the yellow curry.  Neither was anything to write home about.  This was hardly the best thai food i have ever had.  Honestly I wish we had just eaten at one of the places in our hotel instead of having to get the car from valet and drive here.  with all the dining options in vegas, especially on the strip, i doubt i would be back."
0,"Arrival.. Thursday evening saw several people outside restaurant smoking. Proceeded inside and seated ourselves. After sitting there for a while we realized the people we passed outside were in fact the wait staff:) so they came in when they were finished smoking and brought us our menu without stopping to wash hands. They do not have bottled water, so I ask for a glass of water without fruit. Not to hard, I was her only table. I received a glass of water with lemon. I ordered the fried chicken.. Yum or so I thought, until we watched our server proceed dig and dig in her hair, wipe her mouth and last but not least wipe her nose all before she served our food. I only ate the piece of chicken in the center of my plate and did not get a to go box... Will not be going back."
1,"Very delicious food!   Their stuffed won-tons where too thin for my taste, I like them a little thicker, but I still loved them.  The ambiance was very quiet and peaceful, just what I need after a long day at work.  Service was great until more people started shopping up and then the service was not so great.  I recommend this place for a peaceful hangout and Asian food dinner :)"
1,Must try the guacamole...and their pulled pork dishes are phenomenal!! I have yet to eat anything bad from here. Very authentic and very good. They make the guacamole fresh right in front of you.
1,"CJ, the manager, is awesome. He helped me figure out just what I needed. I had NO idea FedEx could do all the signs I needed, including window clings, posters, a vinyl banner and foamboard signs that can be contour cut!"
1,"Been back a couple times since last review.  Margaritas were perfect both times.  Watermelon margaritas are unstoppable!  Chile relleno was a little bland and soupy, but the rest of the menu was terrific as usual."
1,Love anytime fitness! I go to the one on Rainbow. Have a great personal trainer named Nate if anyone is looking for one. There is never a lot of people here so there's always machines available to use. There's tanning for $20 a month if you want to use that. Only downside of this location is no showers.
0,"Arrived for Sunday lunch-dinner with the kids and only one other couple was there. \n\nStarted with the Sizzling Rice Soup, which we all shared, and the broth was really good. It had veggies, chicken, pork and shrimp. It was really tasty and if we go back I would definitely try it again. \n\nWe had the Hunan Spicy two which is shrimp and chicken in a sweet and spicy red sauce, really good. Also had the Sizzling Go Ba which is four meats poured into a sizzling pan in front of you. After the sizzle went out though the flavors were bland. It's a clear sauce, but needed salt or some other spice. \n\nI would go again if invited, but not by choice."
1,"The newer part of the hotel is very swanky. Great concierge service, super knowledgeable about events and best places for dining and entertainment.\n\nRoom service and housekeeping get thumbs up too.\n\nWet Republic! Holy bananas! it's a lot of fun!\n\nGreat weekend for sure."
0,"I also was a first time visitor using a Groupon.  I have to One-Star them because they refused to honor the Groupon.  I print Groupons the day I buy them as a physical, visual reminder to use them.  My day of purchase printed Groupon clearly stated on its face that it's expiration date was December 5.  I ate at the restaurant on December 5, and the management falsely claimed that the Groupon was expired. Beyond the manipulative dishonesty of the management, the food was very mediocre IMHO.  The chicken teriyaki was a frozen skinless boneless chicken breast like you would buy by the bag at costco or sams club, cooked barely long enough to no longer be raw, with no flavoring or seasoning whatsoever.  the vegetables were steamed but also with no flavoring or seasoning whatsoever.  The salmon teriyaki was the same story.  The yakisoba was 180 degrees the opposite direction, too much salty seasoning.  The decor is very nice, and the restaurant has a nice ambiance and vibe, but the mediocre food and bad Groupon experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  We won't be back."
1,"In my 32 years of life I have never ever had such an amazing experience as I did last night. Our waiter Mags and his team took such great care of us. The music, atmosphere and insane food are out of this world. I have never hugged my waiter after a meal but we felt like family once we left. We can't wait to go back."
0,"Went in looked nice. That is where it ended. Bad service, it took 20 minutes to get our drinks and then they took our order. We ordered an appetizer and three meals. They brought them all together 40 minutes later. Everything was cold. We will not be back again."
0,"I have been here twice and they take too many appointments for the number people they have. Then they take walk ins even when they have appointments waiting. It would be nice if they could keep on schedule versus leaving people waiting.  I agree that everyone is friendly, so they are better than some I have been to if you have over an hour and a half to spend on an express pedicure."
0,"I was pretty disappointed with Steve's Espresso.  Considering its moniker, you'd think the espresso would be good here.  It wasn't.  My espresso was bitter and a touch sour.  It was drinkable, but that's hardly a recommendation.  \n\nI tried one of their breakfast pastries, with cheese, bacon, and egg.  I was even less impressed with that.  I was surprised when the cashier handed it to me and told me I should go microwave it myself in an oven they have by the door.  I was told to put it in for 45 seconds.  I figured they would know their business and trusted what I was told.  After I left I decided to sneak a bite while stopped at a light.  The thing was ice cold in the center.  Great.  A bacon, egg and cheese-icle.  Even the part around the edge that was warm wasn't that great.  The dough tasted like it came out of a tube.  I probably would have been better off with something else.  There were several baked goods in the case that looked amazing.\n\nThe person that helped me seemed really nice, so I kind of feel bad giving the place such a hard review.  Honestly, most people would probably be happy with the drinks here, especially if you're the sort that pumps a bunch of sugary crap into your drink. \n\nAccording to a sign on the door they specialize in French press coffee, so ordering that might be a better bet.  But if that's the case, why doesn't he call the place Steve's French Press Coffee?  Either way, I won't be risking another stop here."
0,"My wife's massage last year was fantastic and was the reason I bought it for her again while in town for the holidays.\n\n Only giving one stars this time because of their flexibility in showing up late. Not sure if the masseuse was certified for pregnant massages, but my wife didn't even have her back massaged (not because she didn't want it), was jerked around on the table, and she was unfocused throughout. Overall, the experience wasn't relaxing at all. I'll probably give Evolve another shot next year, but this experience was not worth the hassle of driving there, let alone the cost."
1,"Bobby's Sandwich Bar is in a great location for grabbing a quick and tasty lunch on your way back from the Royal Mile or the nearby Greyfriars Bobby's Bar.  I've been here a few times and it always offers pleasant, quick service and a comfortable environment to enjoy your lunch in.  The food is also excellent.  They have a great range of sandwiches from prawn mayonnaise to mature cheddar and onion.  I usually go for the tuna mayo with cucumber and bag of crisps.  It costs less than \u00a33 and tastes amazing with delcious bread and really fresh salad.  \nFurther, they're never stingy with their portion sizes and you really feel like you're getting value for your money.  Haven't tried the soup myself, but my friends rave about it, especially the tomato and pepper.  \nIf you're in the area and fancy a delicious, cheap lunch then Bobby's Sandwich Bar is the place."
0,When we arrived we were told the wait would be 15-20mins then after 20mins we were called to be seated but the host told us he could not seat us until the 3rd person arrived so we would have to go back on the list and wait again once the 3rd person arrived - I have never heard of such a policy since we were ready to order all of the food -all ready have the 3rd persons order. We walked out and went to Mimi's where they sat us right away and served us coffee while we waited. Last time I was at Babystacks they messed up our order and we waited 20 mins for them to bring us the correct food and it was cold. Will not be going again.
1,"My kids love coming here for storytime.  They sing songs, read a book and usually do some kind of craft at the end.  It can get a little crazy sometimes, people letting their kids run wild while the story is trying to be read, etc.  I recently rediscovered the library by coming here for storytime.  I didn't realize they had such a great selection and that you could get new releases at the library.  I am a pretty fast reader and hate paying for a book I read in a day.  It is super easy to request books online.  I usually just run in to grab something I have requested off the hold shelf.  They have computers you can reserve and like most libraries they have free wi-fi.  I have tried to use their wi-fi printing but it seems like they are always having issues with it.   They have a security guard that seems to keep everyone in line.  I've never seen any problems here."
1,"Sahib is a solid Indian restaurant, with reasonable prices and a really nice atmosphere to dine in all in the heart of the otherwise limited dining of the west island. \nThe food is consistently good, with a wide range of choices. The buffet is more limited, but the sit down menu has never let me down.\nThe staff are friendly. And they have Cobra beer on tap. \nThis is a frequent stop on trips to pte Claire."

0,They've gone down in general.  Portions are smaller for happy hour.  Service is still aright.  Drained the pond out front.  Sad.  Bread and butter were not fresh last week and I always look forward to THAT simple pleasure .  We can forgive the burnt and salty lobster since they gave us a new one on the house without us even asking.  Just disappointed as we used to LOVE this place.
1,Very reasonably priced and a higher quality pedicure than I expected.  I will be returning.
1,"Wow, I was really surprised and impressed!  We noticed that the restaurant had changes hands, but had not thought to try it until we saw it on Yelp.  This is definitely not the usual generic, anglicized Mexican fare, but seems more like a family restaurant in Sonora.  The food was great and the portions were generous.  Our server was attentive and prompt, but to our surprise, we were the only patrons on a Sunday evening.  I agree with the other reviews about the decor... Kind of  campy with a fake jungle theme going, but it was fun and not over the top."
0,"Heard so many great things about this place, but when I went for lunch on a Monday, it pretty much was a disappointment. Selection of foods was paltry and no seafood at all except for the cocktail shrimp which they put like three at a time in a little cup. Will give it another shot maybe for dinner next time though."
1,OMG!!! My absolute Fav! Hotel! Buffet! All That! I LOVE THE WYNN! Don't do Vegas without it!
1,"The pretzels balls. ARE YOU JOKING ME. \n\nDelicious and a sick little place to have dinner. Very modern vintage in the place and good for a night out with the girls to have drinks and apps. \n\nAgave margs, yum"
1,"This place is almost stereotypical for the Americanized Mexican fast food, but as it isn't a chain and since the food was quite tasty I feel that I am wrong if I don't promote it. \n\nI had the pastor burrito, that come with a decent amount of nice tasting pork - and they have coupled this with some kind of pineapple sauce that is way tastier than it looks. As I will not drive here to catch my lunch, I will stop by here if I am in the neighborhood.\n\nFood is good, everything else is kind of a minimum effort - but I appreciate a local business over a franchise any day. So, for what it is.. it's good!"
1,"Great happy hour spot - drink specials and 1/2 price appetizers\nGood for groups\nFriendly and attentive staff\nI like the chips and salsa, queso, house margarita, draft beer in a chilled goblet, and create your own combo choices"
0,"We ordered shrimp dumpling soup and requested 2 bowls, but our server did not think it would be enough for us so we cancelled that order and requested the pan fried noodles with chicken.  We ended up receiving both.  The soup had a curious flavor and the noodle dish was pretty mundane."
0,"Blech.  I think I must have been at a different buffet than these other reviewers, because this was horrible.  When we walked in, it was like we were in the South Pacific.  Seriously.  The thermostat must have been set at 90.  A nice change from the 40 degree weather outside, but after about three minutes, it was the worst.  Maybe that's for atmosphere, but it was not enjoyable.\n\nTo make the experience even less appetizing, the place is cramped and the staff does not help at all in this regard - they are constantly in the middle of the aisles, writing tickets and getting drinks in the middle of the walking areas and the like.  Again, they could be going for atmosphere, and having the staff constantly around is nice, but with overbearing heat and little room to move it's not good.  It's bad.  Really bad.  If you don't like personal space, you're good.  Really good even.  Otherwise, it stinks.  Literally.  I've been to restaurants in big cities, where rent is outrageous, that have more room to move than this.  In Pineville, there ought to be all sorts of elbow room (Schoolhouse Rock anyone?).\n\nYes, there is a sushi bar where a guy makes it in front of you.  Let me first tell you that I'm not really a sushi guy.  I like California rolls and those little rice cakes with shrimp on them, and a few other things, but none of the more exotic stuff.  But this was nasty.  He would take a big fried thing and plop it down on a plate and squirt some heavy mayo-like sauce all over it.\n\nThat's not too bad, right?  Well, once the rolls were gone, he'd do it again - without cleaning the plate.  That's right, there was a buildup of this mayo on the platter.  Several varieties, all right there under the lights.  It was pretty sickening.  Like a sushi hog pond.\n\nOn the regular buffet, it wasn't too bad, but it wasn't that good either.  If you want a Southern food buffet (meat, rolls, corn), it's okay.  But the Chinese food was just average.  Add that to the place, the staff, the price - go elsewhere.  China King and Dragon House aren't far away, and Tin Tin is just up the street (though I'm not a huge fan of Tin Tin either).  You'll have a much nicer experience."
0,"I am sorry, but did it say that Blanco serves Mexican food?  This is a disgrace.\nLets just start by saying that my experience here was less than mediocre.  I usually find one thing wrong with a place and still give 4 stars.  This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.  (The hostess was the other 10%...very unpleasant...like I was bothering her to get seated....honey that is your JOB!)\nI met my lovely friend Karla for lunch...she recommended the place and I have been wanting to try it.  We both ordered the chicken tortilla soup to start and I ordered also the enchiladas with green chiles.\n\nThe chicken tortilla soup was a catastrophe.  It was made with chicken broth with every vegetable you can think of, chicken, and WHOLE tortillas.  The tortillas were a soggy mess and the soup was just G-d awful.  The server (who was nice) had the manager come over and take it off my bill.  (Which was nice.)  The manager even said that my soup looked very unappetizing.\n\nNext was the enchiladas...first...I didn't know that enchiladas were supposed to be HARD and CRUNCHY!!!  It was greasy, the cheese was flat out disgusting...and they even put my green chiles on the side when I did ask them to put them in the enchiladas. (Which shouldn't be too hard) And on top of everything else, my rice was BUTTERED WHITE RICE!!!!  In a Mexican style Restaurant?  Are you kidding me?  And it was so unappealing...(this meal I had to pay for...)\n\nThere was no Mexican flavor or feel at all in this restaurant.  Very displeased and have no desire to ever step foot in there ever again."
1,"I like this location and I am a huge fan of margaritas and tacos. I always order the tofu tacos here. Trust me, they are amazing. Even Bobby, who does not care for tofu, thought they were good! \n\nOverall, it's a decent restaurant and it's nice that they offer valet service. Wait times are very unpredictable, though, so if you don't go on a more quiet night, you could be waiting for awhile (and probably outside because the foyer is so very small!)\n\nLast time we were here we were seated upstairs. I thought this would be cool but it actually just seemed to result in slower service. I would request seating downstairs if the wait time isn't crazy.\n\nThe food is consistently good so we keep coming back!"
1,"Ramen, not the most popular thing in Las Vegas, mostly due to whatever ramen we have is usually too salty, bland, or expensive. I almost gave up on finding a decent ramen place... until I met Monta Noodle house :). \n\nMonta Noodle House is in a plaza I rarely ever go into mostly because it seems a bit run down compared to the other plazas. Despite the appearance of the plaza, Monta is a nice little restaurant that serves water that doesn't taste like reclamation. \n\nDuring my visit I was immediately greeted by the staff and seated. This  place is ideal for a quick lunch with a few friends, but if you have a large party you may want to think twice because of the small capacity of the restaurant. You may want to avoid lunch during prime time if you are in a hurry because it seems that they have one waitress, and it seemed to be quite hectic for her. \n\nThe tonkatsu ramen is the one which the broth is made from pork bones, it was flavorful, had a meaty and fatty taste, but most importantly when I got home I wasn't downing water how I would if I was eating pho. I added corn to my ramen which was a nice touch, and rather inexpensive. Extra noodles (kagemane?) is available for the hungry eaters at a cost of $2.00, well worth it in my opinion because the noodles do not look like they were once dry like some other places.\n\nWill definitely be back to fulfill my noodle hunger."
1,"This review is for the baked goods. I had the pleasure of buying a pack of 4 cupcakes and boy were they delicious! The cake was moist and the frosting was just the right amount of sweet. Each flavor was unique and scrumptious on its own. If your looking for good quality baked goods, look no further! I can't wait to come here for a sit down meal! \nI hope this place stays in business forever!"
1,"I am totally enamored with this place.  Saw the sign a few weeks back while leaving Cafe Rio (across the street).  We are always looking for fun little places to take the kids for special treats but this is our new fave!  Atmosphere is simple and fun, the popcorn is delicious (my fave at the moment is the Chicago!) and the service has been amazing.  \n\nI've used the popcorn as a party favor for a baby shower and everyone opened their boxes and ate it right there at the party.  I don't think a single kernel made it to anyones home!  Their bags and tin would make excellent gifts as well.  \n\nDefinitely our new favorite place to go after dinner!  Or breakfast...but we are trying to set some good examples for our little guys."
0,"Greeting everyone!\nFirstly, can someone explain how this store is still in business?\nSecondly BB should not be hiring their employees right off the street! (No offense to others)\nI went in to this BB branch to buy a Macbook Air which was on $200 discount. I also had a authentic movers coupon after moving here to AZ recently which would give me additional 10% off. When the transaction was half way through and the cashier called in Mr. Johny (Allegedly the Asst. store manager for this branch). He saw the final price was way below the MSRP rate and this made him Jealous. He rudely refused to apply the coupon. I understand that he was well with in his right to deny me service since he  owns the store...at least he thinks he does. But here is where he crosses the limit. He tried to steal my coupon and refuse to give it back to me for obvious reason that he wanted to use it later for himself or he does not want me to use at another store. I tried to explain him that he has no right whatsoever to touch my property or lets say property of USPS but this fact would simply get into his head. \n\nFinally, Mr Johny...Just wanted to let you know that i had to return the laptop back to BB(which i eventually bought anyways WITH THE COUPON) because i scored the same Laptop for nearly a $100 cheaper at another store. Now don't ruin your Christmas and new year over it. \nMERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! :)"
0,"I used to go to Lee's in Irvine, CA all the time as an undergrad and had to make a lil' nostalgic trip on through while in China town. The service at this location was horrible.\n   I waited in line (only one in line) for five minutes before I kindly asked if I was in the correct line. The cashier told me yes, and continued what she was doing. When she was done she said \""... you can order...\"" and wasn't even looking at me or standing at the cash register. I ordered and was charged more than the menu price so I questioned why, she told me because I ordered a large. I pointed out the large was less than what I was charged and she shuttered \""... oh... um, they changed the prices\"" which would have been fine had that had been her reasoning in the first place. \n    It wasn't even busy. And that is the ONLY way I forgive bad service... Guess I'll only go to Lee's in CA"
1,"Tip Number 1 - Go with the flow. For visitors the salmon flow counterclockwise around the capital.\n\nTip Number 2 - You'll need cash. Look for a UW  Credit Union ATM. They are free, no charge machines.\n\nBesides that have fun. The spicy cheese bread is very popular. We also love the hedgerow jam, spicy pickles, cheese curds and bakery.\n\nEverything closes down at 1pm, but some vendors will run out of things and close down closer to noon. So get there early."
1,"Dr Qamar and his incredibly caring staff, both in the Scottsdale office and the Mesa surgical location, all went above and beyond to create a positive experience for my recent cataract surgery. Their kindness, professionalism, and attention to detail was second to none. I highly recommend Dr Tariq Qamar and Q Vision for your vision improvement needs. They don't get any better than Q VISION!!"
1,"A great cleaners who does everything onsite.  I think they are locally owned and are really nice people.  It's priced like all the others too.  No price gouging here!\n\nWe get tired of the pre-paid crap owned by some Arab, that is sent out somewhere and is only a store front.  This one is definitely not one of those."
0,"With a hour delay, we ventured from Gate B to Gate C, the Southwest mecca and were drawn to the outside of Sammy's which caught our eye.   Things quickly went downhill after.\n\nService was slow but hopefully the food would make up for it.  We got a bacon cheese burger which was 13.50 but worse than a 2 dollar burger at your nearby fast food joint.  It was worse than your elementary school burger with the exception that it was topped with lettuce, tomato, and bacon. \n\nThe so called breakfast wrap for 9.99 was filled simiply with egg.  Overall i felt robbed - in fact i think i would have felt better if someone held me up for 25 dollars then i could eat my miseries away after with enjoyable food.\n\nDo yourself a favor and dont come here EVER.  Wendy's, Poepyes, and Villa Pizza is a few steps down and you'll pay 30-40% less and get better food."
1,"*I always go to buffets with my friend Gluttony*\n\n\nAs we roll up to the M Resort I walk up in anticipation to Studio B. This was my first time, but a few of my friends had already been. Although I try not to listen to hype they said that it was pretty tootin' n bootin' so I'll have to admit I was a little anxious. \n\nNow we ended up waiting in line for almost 2 hours total (well, for me and two others it was more like an hour. We went and deposited money to the casino while our awesome friends waited in line for us. Thanks you guys *insert cheesy smile and wink*)\n\nOnce we entered they sat us at the back, but it had a great view of the strip, desert, and even more desert. After waiting in line for so long we all went straight to see the spread. Now I have this problem when I go to buffets where when I see something appealing I get excited and get it right away leaving less space for me to get other stuff. In this case there was a giant selection. So as always I end up starting off with two plates. Don't judge. \n\nThere was an impressive layout of seafood and they even had a whole tray of melted butter for crab legs. Be careful though, if you don't eat the butter fast enough it WILL solidify. They have your typical buffet foods, but what really surprised me was that they had CHICKEN ADOBO. For those of you who are not familiar with what that is it's a Filipino dish. I was amazed at the fact that they had this so I had to try it. Everyone at the table tried it, and we all came up with the same conclusion: It was a little salty, but pretty darn good. And we at the table were borderline shocked at how delicious the pad Thai was.\n\nOne thing that I must point out is their prime rib. It was so T-E-N-D-E-R that we used a butter knife to cut it. Yup, that's pretty tender. \n\nDessert bar = extra workout time. \n\nThey also have unlimited beer and wine. I'm sure that just added points in a lot of people's books. \n\nAll in all I really enjoyed the food, and can see myself coming back here. I give it a 5 star rating because it blew my expectations out of the water, and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. Give it a try. Hopefully you'll find as much delight in it as much as I did."
1,I've found a new default place to stay when in town. This hotel was built in 2009 and the rooms are large and clean (and new). Frosted glass separates the bed area from the work area which includes a desk and couch. It has a real shower (not a bath tub ... who uses those in a hotel?). Even the toilet has its own room with sink.
1,"Great food. Chopped salad is filled filet mignon, black spaghetti is full of great seafood and the butterfish is fantastic. Bartenders can be hit or miss. Small plates/sides are also hit or miss (Brussel sprouts were not good)."
1,"MASSIVE VENUE.\n\nSeriously. It's a music venue, a bar, a bowling alley, a lounge, a and restaurant. If you're not in the mood for the \""club scene\"" but you still want to party in Vegas, this is a great place to go and drink/dance. The vibe is non-pretentious and fun. Leave your slutty dress and heels at home! \n\nI came here for a Cherub show and had a blast. The stage is a decent size, and they had a massive dance floor in front of the stage. It gets SUPER LOUD in here, so I stood clear of the speakers. The venue is also super well ventilated, so much that I even got a little chilly after standing still for a bit. The Brooklyn Bowl also didn't fill  up too bad so I never felt claustrophobic. Paying for a ticket to see live music here is probably cheaper than paying the entrance fee to some ridiculous club. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
1,"Is there a meal you have had that you will never forget?  You will never forget this place.  The food is amazing.  You really could cut your steak with a fork.  It is that tender and delicious.  Forget the steak sauce.  You will enjoy the flavor of the steak just as is.  It comes out on a 400 degree plate.  The sides,  Absolutely wonderful.  They put a little twist on each one and 1 side is more than plenty to share.  But get two,  it is impossible to pick just one.  The service,  unbelievable.  The best ever.  We were a large group of 20.  They put us in a room of our own.  We had 5 waiters/servers who were very attentive,  friendly, fun and I know it is a big job when you ask to have separate checks for everyone, but the waiter did and there was not one mistake on anyone's check.   Some of us finished with a dessert.  The red velvet bread pudding was lush.  It wasn't too sweet and even though I was full, I still had to have another bite.  \n\nIf you are looking for a great steak, you must absolutely try this place.  You will not be disappointed."
0,"On the verge of just giving one star I, I figured on 2 only because I enjoyed the cool open interior of the main restaurant. As far as the food. That is one star. \nWhile having just stopped in at the Ranch Market to pick up a few groceries, I was going to eat at the Market itself but decided to maybe try a place I had never tried near by instead. As I took my groceries to the car, I decided that since I had not yet tried \""Tradiciones\"" I would give them a try. \nI enjoy the food at the Ranch Market-- tasty and authentic.  Since they are connected I THOUGHT the food would be the same. Boy was I wrong!  I don't know who they have cooking here, but with all the great stuff they have next door it should be A LOT better. \nThe salsa should have been the first clue...it was just ok.  Again, knowing what they make in house next door, made this salsa pretty sad.  Wanting an Agua Fresca to drink and again knowing next door had like 7+ varieties, I was disappointed they only had horchata and pina here. I got the pina, which was probably the best part of this meal. \nI was really craving some tacos, and noticed they only really offered them under the appetizer menu as street tacos. Also wanting to have a sopito, I thought WTH I will get the sampler platter and add a taco. \n\nThe platter came with 2 mini chimis, 2 mini taquitos, 2 mini cheese enchiladas and a soptio each of chicken and beef. All looked good when it came out. I enjoyed the taco first...the last thing I was to enjoy on this culinary outing. Then, digging into the chicken enchiladas, the sauce was a \""mole\"". This was not a good mole...way too sweet, someones idea of a mole. Yes, just because a mole has chocolate doesn't mean it's a chocolate sauce.  And the chicken, stringy bland kinda tough. Everything followed suit, bland not very authentic, someones idea of mexican food. It all reminded me of something I would get if in the Mid-west somewhere and wanted Mexican food...not Arizona! \n\nThe only saving grace to this meal was that it was happy hour on a Saturday and the platter was 1/2 off and the taco was a buck so I left paying only $9 instead of $15. \n\nWhile I will continue to eat at the Market....I will pass on TRADICIONES...*blegh*."
1,started coming here a few months ago. good food and good prices.
1,AMAZING! incredibly knowledgeable staff.  i got the wine pairings and all were delicious.  overall an amazing experience. it is pricey but worth the splurge.
0,We live nearby but just never tried them. FInally we went. \n\nFood: Just not that good. Pizza was tasteless. Salad blah. Pasta nothing special. Neither of our tummies felt good afterwards (probably too much grease). \n\nService: Good. Friendly. \n\nAtmosphere: Just above fast food. Bathroom dirty and not maintained - which means they probably aren't keeping up in other areas. Workers coming and going wearing aprons. \n\nConclusion: Seems to be a family owned place that is on the decline. Food just isn't good enough to return.
1,"Still in the process suite, freaking amazing. Very roomy, nice big bathroom, and the tub is amazing! Really made my fiance's birthday great. Great location, only a couple blocks from the strip and the staff is really friendly and helpful.\n\nWill be coming back to this hotel."
1,"Fresh fish flown in daily, fantastic cioppino and the best calamari I've ever had. We've been back three time and have referred the place to several friends that have dined here as well. Knocking off one star as the service is a little inconsistent, but that should improve in time. Check it out!"
0,"This company did beat the competitor Chase in rates and fees. My broker seemed legit and wanted the business. Little did I know that he would pass the buck off to other people to finish our loan process. Our escrow was two months... TWO MONTHS and they still waited until 3 business days before closing to request more documentation from us, then threatened to extend the closing date due to us not getting the paper work to them.... I tried calling and pushing 0 \""if this matter requires immediate assistance\"". On hold for 20 min only to get a voicemail every single time!  No return call until days later. Communication = 0 in this company.  They don't treat their customers with respect. They treat customers like they are doing favors for you just by giving you a home loan. I would go elsewhere if I had more time.  The only positive was working with Nathan who gets it done quickly if you speak directly to him."
0,"As other reviews have mentioned, the space is very crowded.  There is barely room to stand inside of the door to wait.  The women that work in the salon have to eat their lunch sitting on a milk crate in the back and there is no space...so the crate is in front of the bathroom door and you can barely get inside.\n\nI've found they do a fine job at pedicures, but do not go here for a gel/shilack manicure.  They polish starts lifting after two or three days.  I've been maybe five times and every single time this happens.  I won't be back for a manicure, despite their close proximity to my house (walking distance).  \n\nThey also tell you they \""prefer cash\"" when you try to pay with your card.  I find this odd for a business of this size, especially when they see you are paying with a card.  Whatever the reason, it made me feel uncomfortable."
1,Asian and Latin fushion = yummy!  Must get the sea bass and miso skewers!
1,"Came to buy some flowers and organic fruits.\n\nI picked up Kale that was on sale, Strawberries and red grapes that were deliviously naturally sweetened!\n\nUnfortunately, I had an incident with the flowers when I got into my car, but the staff were very kind to give me a refund since it was a time sensitive issue.\n\nExpect great customer service and knowledgeable staff at this Town Square location \n\nThe cafe is fantastic as well.\n\nDefinitely quality over quantity !"
1,This is the best authentic Hawaiian BBQ in AZ.  Being from Hawaii it's as close to the local Korean BBQ spots in Hawaii.  They need to have cucumber Kimchi on a much more regular basis though!  I tell the owners that all the time :).  Paradise never disappoints and just wish they had a spot in Chandler.  I believe it's the only place in AZ that serves Meat Jun which is a staple of Hawaiian Korean BBQ.
0,Real bad experiance...feel like its a rip off. They're food is frozen.
1,Went out for dinner with the wife and two kids. The Pizza and chicken were both great. The garlic bread included with the meals as an appetizer is awesome. I have eaten here 3 or four times and each time has been consistently good. Prices are fair. \nWe will be back.
0,"The main reason I give this hotel 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the location. It is central to most of the nicer hotels and casinos on the strip. If you are looking for a nice hotel to stay at I would not recommend the Flamingo. The casino is one of the smokier ones and the staff is not friendly. The rooms, elevator, and hallway floors are dirty and have either spilled beer or vomit?"
0,"If I could give them 0 stars I WOULD.\nTried talking to a worker on the phone to see if they sold a certain item I wanted, \nHUNG UP ON ME. \nCouldn't even imagine how they are in person."
1,"Yah, I know. It's just a gas station/convenience store. Not something to Yelp about. Except that it is.\n\nIn the last handful of hours on long road trip, a place that is clean and has yummy coffee concoctions is kind of a big deal. They do. The coffee was just from one of those press the button espresso kinds of machines, but the flavors were really yummy. Since they are sweet, I tend to mix them with some regular coffee, and I like places where the regular coffee is also fresh. Here? It was.\n\nStill, none of that would have seemed so Yelp-able, except for what happened before all that. \n\nRoad trips mean public bathrooms, which few folks think of as enjoyable. I was amazed when I walked in at how *clean* and even *nice smelling* the bathroom was. Even the lighting was just nice. I can't explain. But this is what made me have to Yelp it.\n\nGo here, get some gas, yummy coffee, do your thing in a place that's not as public bathroom feeling as you'd expect, and then come back to tell me I was right about this place."
1,"Awesome breakfast joint. The food is great. Try the biscuits and gravy. The scrambled eggs were perfect and the coffee was excellent.\n\nBe warned, this place is small, so don't go in with a large party."
0,"Probably the lamest club in Vegas. Music sucks , crowd sucks , tables suck! Why go to Hyde when you can go to hakkasan or marquee or the million other newer and better clubs! Plus, the bouncer Jeff or Jo of John  is a lil bitch. Chill ur a bouncer , calm the ef down. Ur not Obama"
1,"Interesting waffle creations. Last time we had the thanksgiving waffle: infused with chicken and topped with marshmallows, great combo. Tip if you go with someone.  Get one savory waffle, one sweet waffle, and share"
1,"Overall our dinner at Viva Michoacan was a pleasant experience. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the service is quick. Plus a mariachi band playing = bonus star.\n\nWe had a dinner of chicken tacos, a beef burrito, a beef tamale and a beef soft taco. The chicken tacos, according to my GF,  were \""muy delicioso\"" which I think means she liked them. While hot, my beef tamale and burrito were good, but upon cooling the shredded beef became stringy and harder to chew. Even so, the general quality of the food felt good. I'll just avoid the shredded beef next time."
1,"This place is fast becoming my favorite AYCE spot here in Vegas - it has been more reliably good than any other.\n\nTasty appetizers (especially the garlic chicken), good quality fish and quick service make me want to keep coming back here."
1,Terrific sandwiches! I had a mix of corned beef and pastrami after consulting with the woman behind the counter. Note: there's also a cool neighborhood surrounding PB. \n\nWorth working into a future Pittsburgh trip!
0,"If you are having tile installed on a second floor, make sure they qualify that your floor doesn't flex too much for tiles to set properly. The subcontractor told us that ours flexed too much after it was installed. My tiles now \""crunch\"" as I walk on them. They were kind enough to extend the warranty to two years, but I was told by the subs this would happen, so it does no good to complain. Just be aware."
1,"Citizen Public House of course! Long known among locals for it's great blend of ambiance, great drinks and adventurous appetizers it's no wonder this was on our list of places to recommend.\n\nHappy Hour has some unusual items on the menu, this is when I should warn you that your typical menu. Many of the appetizers come served in bell jars and are meant to be shared and explored. Looking for more standard fare, don't worry, all the regular appetizers are  1/2 off during Happy Hour as well and you can still find some signature items here to try also.\n\nMay we suggest the Tender Belly Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn? Once again remember that all regular appetizers are half off during Happy Hour. Dig yourself some comfort food? How about Chicken and Waffles? Buttermilk-marinated fried chicken on oat waffles covered in almond butter and blue clover honey. Another must try item on the menu is the Kiltlifter Fondue. It is served with bread, sausage and apple slices for dipping with those cute little forks. Yeah what's not to love about a great fondue?\n\nRead the entire review here... http://schmoozeaz.com/blog/?p=652"
1,"Fabulous. I love their cookies of course, but their salads and soups are great. The bread is perfect. Everyone at my work eats here at some point during the week for lunch. It's just a staple at this point!"
0,Served nearly raw burger. Charred on the outside: raw on the inside. On-site manager did not resolve problem or seem to care. HORRIBLE QUALITY CONTROL.  Avoid!!
0,"My husband and myself have eaten here 3 times previously and found it pretty good overall so yesterday we found a coupon for $5.99 per person between 1pm-4pm so we decided to take our 15 yr old son after school..we didn't get there until 3:45 pm..we were shown a table and went to get our food and sat down to eat..about 15 mins later our son saw them putting crab legs out and went to get a plateful..I turned around and saw not 1, but 2 servers hurrying over to him..they then proceed to accompany him to us and ask..are you paying for dinner or using coupon..if not paying for dinner he cannot have crab legs...SERIOUSLY !!! our son was completely embarrassed and humiliated by this as other people in the restaurant were looking..and did not want to eat his food..this was his first visit to this restaurant..there were no signs nor were we asked when entering if we would be paying for dinner or the coupon price this is completely unacceptable to treat someones child in this matter..any other buffet we have gone to has never harassed us about paying extra if we happened to be there when the switch from lunch to dinner was being made...I'm sure they would not lose a crap load of money if my son had eaten the one plate of crab legs he had..we ended up paying 11.99 for him and used the coupon for us so he could have the crab legs he wanted to eat..oh and AFTER they harassed and embarrassed my son they put signs on all the dinner food saying \""for DINNER CUSTOMERS ONLY \"" shame on you crazy buffet..you have lost us as customers and made our son leery of buffets...PRICELESS !!!"
0,"This place sucks lines are long and the people have no sense of urgency 15 minutes to process one customer and when they finish with the customer ,they walk out\n\nThey can pay two people to stand around and do nothing but call out numbers ...yes you have to take a number but they can't staff the desk with enough people so you don't have to stay in line for an hour"
0,"This was my first time experiencing a brazilian steakhouse. Unfortunately, I was not blown away. While walking up to the entrance, I noticed the greeter passing out coupons to people passing by. When we came up, she asked us if we had reservations. We did. She tried to discreetly hide the coupons and led us to the table. When I inquired about the coupons, she acted very annoyed and was hesitant to hand one over. So what? Just because we already had plans to eat here meant we weren't allowed to get a discount? I did not like her attitude at all. \n\nThe waiter was decent, but was not especially helpful. He did what was required, explaining the menu and keeping our water glasses filled. \n\nWe were able to go to their buffet for side dishes, and the meat dishes were brought to the table. The side dishes weren't impressive and they were very slow in bringing the meat rodizio around. There were only two guys walking around at a time, then they would disappear, and it was quite a wait in between until they came out with new meat entrees. The food was ok but nothing spectacular, also a little on the salty side. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the meat rodizio while I ordered the seafood rodizio. They brought out a tiny dish with 3 scallops the size of nickels!!!!!!! The salmon and cod were the size of half a deck of cards each, and 3 shrimps on a skewer. I had to order at least 3 orders. I understand that maybe the Gulf oil spill may be limiting seafood choices, but scallops as small as nickels???? For $45??? That was pathetic.\n\nI was ok with a nice dinner in Vegas and we spent what I expected to spend. But I probably wouldn't return to this specific brazilian steakhouse. I might try ones with better ratings. If anything, maybe one that has nicer people."
1,"Finally found a chic, chill spot in PHX... servers are amazing and so is food and drink,  Go here! \nArtichoke Heaven - yum!\nWhite Sail Ale - yum!"
1,"I like this place.  It has decorations that remind me of my parents house in the suburbs.  I'd been looking for wreaths and swags in the city for years.  The other reviews are dead on.  There is a nice mix of vintage stuff and kitsch decorations. \n\nThe best part of the store is the pricing.  It is very fair.  I try to shop at Penhollows on Highland in Shadyside, but their pricing is pretty steep.  This is much more in my price range."
1,They do a great job on my dirty car!
1,"A dining experience at its best.  Great decor, PLAYLIST OF MY LIFE and oh yeah, that food is pretty darn good too. ;)  Every app and entree was on the mark, and they were also serving up blueberry Long Island Iced Teas that night...magnifique!\n\nI've read a few places that service is spotty--our waitress was amazing, and the bartender and DJ were very interactive and fun even when we were sitting at our table."
1,"One Stop Auto is the only repair shop I will ever use! They have proven to me that they are the most honest and consistently knowledgable mechanics I have ever dealt with. When a dealership told me I would have to replace my AC compressor for $800 I took it to One Stop where they found a small leak, plugged it and recharged my system for under $50! They bend over backwards to fix my problem the first time and go the extra mile to get my car repaired and back to me in the time and at the price quoted! I have never received the kind of service and concern from a service provider like I have from One Stop! They have gained a customer for life!"
1,"Tanzy, I have one word...WOW. \n\nOK , maybe more that one word but that one is definitely the sum of it. \n\nI am basing my five stars not only for the hand crafted cocktails , atmosphere and mouth watering dishes but ESPECIALLY for the above and beyond service we receieved from Katherine during our visit. She had an abundance of reccomendations that time and again proved to be top notch. She was attentive without being overbearing and truly made us feel like we were not \""just another customer\"" but a very important guest. The warm inviting service is what compelled me to take the time to write a review (besides wanting to share this hidden gem with others :).  We started off with the table side mozzarella which our server explained and eventually talked us in to trying. Boy were we glad! What a unique experience and a fun part of our date to pick our seasoning and accompaniments together. We paired it with a FANTASTIC suggested bottle of wine that I am regretting not writing the name down at this moment s my taste buds are already craving its soft tanic fruity notes followed by a peppery finish. What an absolutely amazing pairing. We also tried the carpaccio which I was a initially a little scared to try (raw meat :/) but it was surprisingly good. The calamari in a white wine butter sauce tossed with capers for a zesty finish was the highlight of the meal for me. We finished our meals off with a red velvet bread pudding which I found to be just what I needed to seal the deal but my fiance was less than thrilled about , only because his mothers bread pudding is and always will be the best he's ever had ;) ( who can compete with a mother's cooking??). Overall this experience was beyond memorable and I plan on returning for the inviting service and datesque experience tanzy has to offer. i will admit the menu IS a little pricey but in this case you really do get what you pay for !"
1,"BEST Reuben sandwich and roast beef sandwich I've ever had, and I'm from NY! Would have loved to try a root beer or cream, or egg soda, but I was too full! Great place, very nice owners and staff!"
0,"I was so excited to try 'wichcraft to help with my hangover one fine, very hot Sunday morning, and could not have been more disappointed. I ordered the gruyere and carmalized onion panini, thinking a nice grilled cheese sandwich would do the trick. It tasted like toasted cardboard - completely bland, dry, tasteless. I actually went back and ordered another sandwich (grilled mozzarella and tomato panini) because the other one was completely inedible. The mozzarella sandwich was barely a step up - at least the cheese had a bit more flavor - but I was hungry, so I ate it. Just don't even go here."
1,"What a fabulous hotel!!!! Best hotel room I've ever stayed in...period! I've flown well over a million miles and stayed many places including Ritz Carlton's, Four Seasons, 5-star resorts in Hawaii, and the room I stayed in here topped them all. The bed itself is to die for! You can actually buy it at the Home Store in the hotel and I plan on it. I slept better than I ever have before. Everything in the room was top notch, very high quality and great design, just like the entire hotel. I haven't stayed at the Venetian or Pallazo yet, so I can't compare. I am staying at Caesars now, and my room at the Encore was vastly superior in every way. The Encore is more expensive per night Han the other hotels on the strip, but you get what you pay for. You owe it to yourself to check it out at least once."
1,"Go here for Brunch! Lunch and dinner are fine, but the breakfast menu and the E61 coffee bar cannot be beat.\n\nMy usual order is a bowl of cafe au lait, and a veggie scramble.  The breakfast potatoes are so good.\n\nIt can get crowded, but if you're in a small group (2) you can usually skip the line and sit at the bar which is full service."
1,"This is actually one of my favorite airports...especially if you have a lot of time to kill between flights. There are great food options all over the airport, plus a really beautiful atrium with dozens of rocking chairs where you can take a load off and people watch for a while. The business center is great in a pinch, too!"
0,"I love Paradise Bakery, just not this one. On too many occasions have they messed up my order or not had key ingredients for main sandwhiches. I keep returning based on convenient location to my home but no more. \n\nSave your money for another location or different restaurant."
1,"Ate here last week for the first time and was surprised.  I had the pulled pork tacos and they were some of the best I've had.  Very similar vibe to Pink Taco here in Century City.  The prices were a bit high, but not too bad for being in Vegas.  The service was ok, not great.  I was really impressed with the taste of the food.  The others with me ordered different meals and everyone was very pleased with their plate.  I will definitely come here again."
0,"I've been here before tonight and it was ok. High price drinks for an ok show...tonight was a different story. $12 entry for small time talent (less than 200 people in the crowd), went here for a friends birthday and the group got separated...they held strong to their  \""no re-entry\"" policy and wanted us to purchase a second ticket. Thanks for helping out someone in their time of need. All about the money and the rules. Well done Fillmore and Live Nation! I'm sure I'll rush back to your venue."
1,"First and only visit to a QT.  The young lady at the register greeted me as I walked in.  Nice. \nVery clean for a convenience store.  I just don't agree with the buy 2 drinks for $3.30, but get 1 for $2.  I see it here, in Indiana and every where I've traveled.  \nAttentive service for the 5 minutes I was there."
1,What a very nice place. All the staff we dealt with were so very friendly. The hotel and room were nice and clean. I would defiantly stay here again
0,"Buddy and I from work decided to go for a Pho Phix at lunch. We decided to forego our usual place close by to give Lemongrass a try due to their higher  average by the Yelpies. \nUpon arrival we were concerned if the place was still open. The landscape is overgrown with weeds and the advertisement banners are in disrepair and faded. However the interior was well kept. \nWe sat at the counter for the comfort of sitting with room due to the fact that all the tables are booths (this really isn't a big deal to the general public unless you're over 6'3\"" and 200lbs+). The stainless steel preparation area behind the counter seemed to have been cleaned with play-dough as there was a milky haze from previous cleaning attempts. I understand Stainless Steel is difficult to keep clean, but it is necessary. \n\nWe ordered some rolls as we waited for our Pho. The rolls were really good but the condiments and veggie plate needed a little more love. Our pho was ok, broth was not as rich as I'm used to and lacked a good portion of noodles.  Our rare beef was well done. \nOur regular Pho place down the street has a lower rating but on this day they were leaps and bounds better Then Lemongrass Cafe. I can see how this place might have been good at one time but their lack of attention to detail recently has caused them to receive a low rating."
1,My favorite place to go to club. The atmosphere is awesome. It is tried to be replicated at other places on the strip but nothing is like this place. I would go back over and over.  Go to encore beach club EARLY so you can get in. otherwise you will end up paying lots of money to get into the club.
0,"If you've been to one self soft serve yogurt store, you've been to them all.  That is unless you go to Menchies where they offer REALLY soft serve.  Both times we tried this place the yogurt was more like thick soup than frozen yogurt.  Yes we got the Yelp discount, but that was the saving grace for this place which won't be around much longer unless it gets its act together."
0,"Let me preface that our party had never been to Posh, and we were very excited for this new dining experience.  We took advantage of Restaurant Week and decided this was the time to give it a try. \n\nWe arrived for our reservations and were seated immediately.  Our table went 17 minutes (we counted) without even getting a hello or a glass of water. Once finally approached by a server, we started getting an explanation of the menu.  We interrupted to ask for water, which must have been our mistake, because after that we received service that was overtly rude.  After finally getting water (which she did not get immediately, she made a big show of topping off every other table's wine and water, while carrying around our water carafe), she explained the menu.  After explaining, she ran off again without asking us if we wanted anything off the drink menu. Forty minutes after being seated, we finally got our bottle of wine. \n\nThe food was average but the portions were so small that our party went to another restaurant and had a second dinner.  We are not people with particularly large appetites, but if you get one course that you don't like or eat all of, you WILL leave hungry.  However, this would have been fine if we had not been treated with such disdain by someone who clearly hates her job--or perhaps just our table.  \n\nIt was a $400 meal, so $100/person, and for that, I expect to be treated with a modicum of decency.  I woke up the next morning still angry with the subpar service.  Our anger at being treated that way is compounded by the fact that Posh considers itself an upscale restaurant.  I honestly have gotten better service at McDonalds. I will NEVER go back. I will NEVER recommend that anyone dine there."
1,"If I could live anywhere in Vegas this would be the spot. It has everything needed to have a good time and than some. \n\nEvery inch of the building is beautiful, swanky and funky all at the same time. With pink chandeliers, modern decor and cool furniture. \n\nOur room was one of the best rooms I have stayed in. I slept better here than I do at home. I melted in the huge comfy feather soft bedding. The shower and tub were incredible. I love the CO Bigelow products that are supplied. I hate trying to use soap that feels like a cheap bar of wax.\n\nThe TV was command central for the lights, music, checking out the amenities and even making restaurant reservations for the places in the hotel. Anything your heart desires can be done through a remote, it is crazy! \n\nThe employees overall were nice and accommodating. The female that checked us in was professional and friendly.  The bell desk fellas were fast and asked about our stay. They also said to let them know if our shuttle didn't arrive that they would help us get to the airport. They gave me the \""warm and fuzzy\"" feelings = great customer service. \n\nMany different types of restaurants, shops, oh and don't forget Wicked Spoon (it is a must) to stuff your belly. \n\nYeah it's a cool spot. Thanks Cosmo for showing me the good life for a few days. Now, I'm back home a little fatter and poorer dreaming of my return."
1,"This was most likely the best meal I've ever had.  From start to finish, myself, and my table of 8 was amazed at what was put down in front of us - I'm so sad that we don't live closer (although, my pocketbook probably isn't).\n\nStarted with the amuse bouche -- ours was a vegetarian bite of artichoke, eggplant caviar among other flavors.  perfectly balanced start to the meal.  We had an option between bacon or olive/asiago rolls -- I'm pescatarian and so went for the olive/asiago - delicious.\n\nNext I split the green garlic soup and the lobster angliotti with a friend.  Both featured fresh seafood (crab in the soup) that was incredibly tender - cooked perfectly.  \n\nI had the spring gnocci for my entree (w/ fresh peas and mint).  I've never had such delicate gnocci - it literally melted in my mouth.  \n\nI sampled almost all of the desserts, but I think the most memorable for me was the toffee pudding with white pepper ice cream -- equally unique and tasty.\n\nOn top of all of the great food we had, the service was outstanding.  We laughed a lot, weren't rushed and felt well taken care of.\n\nA must stop for foodies in Vegas!"
0,Very surprised that the manager or owner has not reached out. Word of mouth is the best advertisement. \n\nDon't go here if you want to pay almost 50$ for gel nails that weren't even shaped
0,"It's a dollar store so not much to expect but some quality people watching.  The product selection is so-so with generic brands of most of your favorite snacks, cleaning products, ect.  While browsing the snack aisle I can not help but hear a mother yelling obnoxiously for her son repeatably as if they were at their own house and not in a public location.  Very annoying.  Once the boy, I'd say who is about 4 or 5 yrs old, comes out of hiding he is waddling down the aisle to confront his mother where she asked \""what is wrong?  Did you poop your pants?\""  Yes the boy confesses.  \""Well guess you learned a lesson, I'll clean you up when we leave\"" and continues to shop with the boy waddling behind.  I purchase my stuff and take off.  As I'm driving out of the parking lot I notice the lady and her son now outside of the store with his pants dropped bent over and her wiping his bum right there in front of the store!  Have you no shame?!  Since this last experience I have decided that an extra dollar or so an item is definitely worth not having to view such trash like this."
1,"I'm giving Soul four starts because three is too low. Based on the food, it's a four. The service and atmosphere aren't my thing- loud and obnoxious. \n\nThe main reason I love Soul is because they serve bone marrow, fried chicken skin, and have an awesome cheese plate. I love the tapas style dishes. The only other items I've had are the hummus, anchovy fries, and the dolmades. Which were all good. So, I have not tried the sushi or ice cream or cupcakes. \n\nBased on food alone, Soul is one of my favorite places. The atmosphere is lacking- I prefer quite/laid back, but I'll endure a lot for bone marrow and fried chicken skin."
1,"I had never been here before, but I'm glad I tried it out. It was the best massage that I've ever had."
0,"C'est cher! Maintenant une soir\u00e9e avec une femme 2 enfants qui mangent un popcorn r\u00e9gulier chaque, 2 boites de friandises, 4 boisson gazeuses r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et biensur 4 billets billet de cin\u00e9ma, c'est 100$.

0,"The service is horrendous and the food is mediocre at best. We waited 10 minutes for the hostess to show up at the hostess stand and then waited another 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order. We saw our waitress a total of three times throughout our meal, yet they were obviously well staffed. The food is equal to that of Applebee's. We ordered the grilled octopus which was woefully under seasoned and over cooked. The brick oven chicken was under seasoned as well. The scallops were ho-hum and the broccoli was equal to that of my 85 year old grandmas over cooked, under seasoned frozen broccoli. If you don't like fennel, don't eat here because it makes an appearance in every other dish it seems like.   Do yourself a favor and go to to one of the many fantastic restaurants in Vegas or just save your money and go across the street to chilli's because you'll get similar food there."
1,"Always excellent service--the food is amazing too, but the service is top notch and keeps me coming back several times a week! :)"
1,"It was my first time using a moving company to move my stuffs, and I have to say I picked the right place! I needed help moving the next day and most of the moving companies told me they did not have anyone that can work next day and some were overpriced!. After searching for awhile and I found Christopher Moving on yelp and decided to call. The representative was very nice and helped me make an appointment for the next day. She told me 2 guys and a truck will come around 11am- 1pm (she was being honest and told me the guys might be early or might be little late because they had to help move right before me and doesn't know if it will take longer or not) and I was fine with that! Next day, 3 guys came at 11:30 and told me they had an extra person to help for free! I was very happy with that because they didn't charge me extra and I wanted the moving to be done within 2 hours so that I don't need to pay more. The moving went smoothly and the guys were awesome! They finished just in time. All three of them were very hard working, which I appreciate:) Overall, I this company was great and will use this company again for my future move!"
0,So I went there at 8pm today and it was closed. Not a very good 1st impression.   I called before I came and there was no indication that restaurant was closed
1,"This amazing steakhouse is a diamond in the rough at Excalibur. It's definitely a pricey restaurant, but well worth it. Steak entrees only come with the steak, no sides. A baked potato side is $6 and it's enormous. The steaks themselves were very large portions. We had the filet mignon and prime rib and didn't feel we needed the sides to feel satisfied with the meal. The steaks were cooked to perfection. Great find in Excalibur!"
0,What a mess. This place USED to be so good on customer service. But now it is like they don't even care. My wife wanted to see the new Kindle Fire. They were working on the display. A worker grabbed one to show my wife. This old shrew of a woman yelled NOOO!!! and took it back. Like my wife seeing it for 30 seconds was some security breach. Added to this we found out they don't offer loaner phones when you are getting your phone worked on. They are also adding deductibles back to their plans. So basically there is no reason to go there over your local Verizon. The place is just a mess and the employees are apathetic. They won't answer questions. They don't get trained anyway. I for see them being out of operation within 5 years!
1,"Facial is very caring.  Massage is alright.  The overall services are pretty good, but I would stay away from the products they carry.  Tried several as recommended by the staff.  Not only did they not help, it causes breakout and dried up my skin.\n\nI've tried several people, they are all very friendly and good at what they are doing."
0,"Stopped in for a pedicure a few days ago.  The salon was clean, chairs were nice, and lots of them. I did not have to wait even as a walk-in.  I was hoping this might be my new nail salon!\n\nThe girl who worked on feet my was rude, bossy, and very aggressive.  My feet hurt and bruned from her scrubbing.  The water was way too hot!  She seemed to be mad at me when I didn't put m foot right where she wanted it.  This was NOT the relaxing experience I was in need of.  I will not be back..."
0,"Spoiler alert! Having lived in other parts of North Carolina, both the Triangle and the Triad, I have to ding Charlotte's Regional Farmers Market. Yes, it has wonderful, locally-grown seasonal produce offered at rock-bottom prices, but it could be so much more.\n\nTake, for example, the Triad Regional Farmers Market, located between Winston-Salem and Greensboro. Not only does it boast much more open-air shelter space, but its \""campus\"" includes an awesome locally-owned and operated garden center, A.B. Seed & Company, a year-round enclosed retail grocery/market open weekdays and weekends, a family-style restaurant, and a wholesale grocery storage facility. I have spent hours there. How's this for a Saturday outing? Browse thru the enclosed grocery for local honey and dried nuts and fruit, hop over to the cafe, nosh on some home cookin', browse around the garden center, and finish it all with a gander through the open-air veggie and farm stands. Now THAT is a destination Farmers Market!\n\nGiven that Charlotte has such a wealth of local growers, sophisticated, diverse consumers, and locovores who love nothing better than to hang out with fellow foodies, I wish our Regional Market would capitalize on its potential to become a destination/gathering place for local food and plant lovers."
1,Great family owend tattoo shop. Great work and clean and invtinig environment.
1,Loved the Salmon Dish!
1,"I've eaten here many times since it opened years ago.  I loved my first visit so much, I took my Mom and her husband for dinner there a few days later!  His fave meal there is the buffalo meatloaf w/ saut\u00e9ed mushroom gravy w/ sides of parmesan mashed potatoes and spiced pecan green beans.  LOVE the spiced pecan green beans!!  My Mom and I adore the seafood entrees served here; she especially loves the tempura-battered shrimp w/ tortilla slaw, FANTASTIC mango haba\u00f1ero chutney and huge steak fries.  I regularly order the pecan crusted trout, w/c comes w/ cilantro peach salsa and tortilla slaw.  While the peach salsa is so tasty and the slaw delicious and marvelously crunchy, my  allergies prevent me from enjoying them, so I always ask for substitutions of mango habanero chutney and spiced pecan green beans, the latter being so sinfully good!!  [According to the restaurant's online nutrtitional guide, It's also calorific AND loaded w/ saturated fat, but hey, I don't smoke tobacco or \""creative\"" cigs, nor do drugs, and I rarely drink (yeah, what fun am I to have around, eh?), so I allow myself occasional splurges w/ certain foods!  So you see, my allergies are blessings of sorts...]\n\nIn the appetizers menu, the lobster spinach queso, coconut shrimp, chicken quesadilla, CRABCAKES, and chicken tortilla soup are all scrumptious!  (Yes, I enjoyed many of these items before I learned that the awful cramps and other seemingly crazy and non-sequential symptoms I'd experience afterwards were caused by food allergies!)\n\nDesserts here are also pretty amazing.  Try their seasonal bread puddings!!  I've tried two versions- one w/ white chocolate and another w/ liquors of dark chocolate and bourbon, perhaps?  I also enjoy a few appetizers offered at half-price during happy hour: buffalo wings, sliders w/ french fries, onion rings, and RIBS!  If you like citrus-y beverages, try Firebirds' signature martini, the Double Black Diamond- fresh pineapple steeped in citrus vodka and garnished w/ a pineapple slice!  \n\nI did make a phone call about a month ago and found that HH appetizer selections have changed to reflect the seasons, so you may want to call ahead if you're like me and suffer from food allergies...\n\nLast, but not least, while table and bar services here can be very spotty, management usually does a fine job w/ follow-ups and corrections.  I also enjoy the ambience here... reminds me of wonderful childhood memories of summers spent in Baguio, the summer capital of Luzon.  Woods, everywhere!  Beams, tables, chairs, floors, restrooms...  There's even a nice fireplace!"
0,"The whole dog theme for a restaurant is bizarre! Peanuts in a dog bowl, dog bone shaped tables, dog related stuff on the walls, but what really killed it for me were the pictures of dogs on the menu. I love dogs, but I don't want to be looking at them  when I'm browsing my menu. The first thing that pops into my head is dog hair, \ndog breathe, and poop....eew!\n\nThe servers are SLOW, don't know the menu and specials, and are not the friendliest. The menu is all over the map. My impression was that this is an \""American Grill\"", but you can order burgers, sliders, Mexican, pasta, and even pizza too....WTH? The only positive thing I have to say about this place is that they have a cool patio with nice fire pits. So unless you're just looking to have a drink and hang out by the fire, stay away from this place.\n\nI used to frequent the Chuy's that was at this location, and that was fun and yummy! If you want dogs and want to be playful, take it to the dog park, not the restaurant."
0,"The food is pretty good and I like the different 50 cent addons (different cheeses, bacon, etc) along with free stuff (onion ring in the burger along with the usual) you can add on.\n\nUnfortunately service while busy really sucks and their ability to recover is pretty sad. First time I went for breakfast, and they ran out of eggs and then hashbrowns resulting in a 30 minute wait for a breakfast combo. Coffee had been sitting so long it was thick and bitter.\n\nNext time I went for lunch and the printer in back ran out of paper or something, so 10 orders including mine disappeared. Even after discovery, took another ten minutes for them to realize they could just ask the customers for the receipts and work off those. Again over half an hour for a whopper combo, even as they served customers that ordered later.\n\nOther times I went were much better and the coffee was much better the next day.\n\nThey really should just give free soda vouchers to folks who wait more than 15 minutes for an order... That would probably cost them five cents and take the edge off the wait."

0,"I'm trying really hard to like this place.  I've been twice so far.  Based on the review on Diners, Drive-ins, and dives, I had high hopes.  So far I am somewhat disappointed.  Service is pretty slow.  Food seemed to take forever to come out and it wasn't that busy.  It's a dive which is no problem as long as the food and service make up for the decor.\n\nFirst visit.  I ordered the Guinea Pie which was OK, but not really special.  For one thing I though it was really bland except for the garlic.  No spice to speak of.  Toppings really sparse and the crust super thin.  Pound for pound I'd consider it pretty expensive for pizza.  It was good enough that I will probably try again with a different pie.  Service was kind of weird.  I ordered at a window, but paid a waitress who took it to the bar.  There is really no place to wait for to go orders except the bar.  If it was quick I'd have no issue with that, but it seemed to take forever.\n\nSecond visit.  I ordered a sandwich called the meathead which is Braised beef, two cheeses, carmelized onion, pickle and creamy mustard.  I got the footlong one for $10, which is reasonable price for a steak sandwich.  My opinion:  You'll get much better steak sandwiches at Pops on Rainbow.  This one had a good bun and enough meat, but the problem was the meat was excessively dry like it was grilled too long and then there is the cheese.  Apparently when they say two cheeses they mean two little slices of cheese.  I've never seen a steak sandwich with as little cheese and the cheese was not mixed into the meat at all.  It was placed on the bun and this big bunch of meat was placed on top.  the pickle was interesting as well as the mayo sauce, but overall it was almost too dry to eat.  I was greeted immediately, they took my order quick, and brought drinks and refills fast.  Getting the sandwich was pretty slow for a sandwich.  I have no big complaints.\n\nI will give this place one more shot.  If they do better I might revise my review with another star."
1,"I've only been to Brio for special occasions. The first was my 21st birthday, the next was the night I got engaged, and the last was for dinner after my husband and I had our civil wedding.\n\nBrio does special occasions like a buncha pros. On my birthday, they made me feel so special, with a free dessert that said \""Happy 21st\"" and a coupon for a free appetizer on my next visit. We didn't get engaged until after dinner, so they didn't do anything for that, lol. But it was still a really romantic date (as far as I knew at the time!) Then, for our wedding dinner, it was me and my husband and our parents, and they really went out of our way to make it a celebration. The waiter was so friendly, and we got an entire dessert sampler complimentary. My husband was wearing his dress blues since we came straight from the wedding, and the staff was thanking him for his service, which we thought was cute.\n\nBottom line, I love this restaurant. Eat here!\n\nFoods I love: the spicy shrimp and eggplant appetizer is to die for, the caesar salad isn't too anchovy-tasting, and the mushroom ravioli is my favorite dish. :)"
1,i won a free hair cut to see ray and i was worried that i was not going to get the best service bc i wasn't paying for it. i was totally wrong!!! he was so professional and had awesome suggestions and ideas! i am also a cosmetologist and was so excited to get such great service and great style. very thankful for that free hair cut bc now i  have found my new hair stylist!!!!!
0,"Staff was outright rude.  They were condescending, never apologized once for the wait.  Also saw crickets and roaches near kitchen and in bathrooms which made me want to vomit.  Unless you want a roach roll do not eat here!  I will be spreading the word that this place should be condemned!"
0,Travel forever for what a waste of time. Food was Average new Chef needs training. Good luck to this place! Don't waste your time and gas. Try the Boulders it's closer!\nService was the worst diner service. Learn how to open a bottle of wine!\nBetter yet go to Cafe Bink same area way better food and service!
0,totally terrible service. i've been to other buca locations in the bay area and i think i'll stick to that.\n\ni recommend getting the chicken marsala though. it's really good
0,"Decided to order a pie from here instead from the usual Domino's for a U.F.C. fight night at my brother's house.  We ordered the pie two sausage and mushroom.  It took a little over an hour to get there.\n\nI paid the extra money to get the \""better crust\""  I just didn't know that it meant it was the harder crust.  I never had a piece of pizza so hard to chew.  My brother asked me how much I paid for this and when I told him he smirked.   Like Vince Vaughn said in Wedding Crashers it's hard to make a bad pizza, but this place did it.  With so many options here in Vegas I would never try there pie again."
1,"Excellent food and atmosphere. Servers are attentive and also very friendly. They have a lot of different rooms to sit in. We sat in the whiskey room which had a bunch of different Irish whiskey on display to choose from. Very authentic Irish pub, would definitely go back."
0,"I've shopped here off-and-on for over a year. I've given it many chances to improve, but after my last visit & after visiting an amazing Giant Eagle in the suburbs (Camp Horne Road - seriously, the difference is like heaven & hell), it's time to add my bad review to the list.\n\nI won't talk about the food options (terrible). I won't even talk about the pan handlers (there all the time). The one thing that would be easy & would improve it to 3-4 stars: customer service. In addition to being understaffed, the cashiers are apathetic & some times angry robots. I've never had a cashier ask me how I'm doing. I've never even had a cashier tell me what the TOTAL is! I went there last night, and I literally stood there staring at him, because I didn't understand that he pressed total. What he finally says: \""YOU CAN SWIPE.\"" In most instances, you have to bag your own groceries even though clearly the cashier is supposed to. Yesterday, after my long, awkward wait, he did bag my groceries. I put them in the car, drove a mile, & walked from my car to apartment (a very close distance) and a bag broke on the sidewalk. He put a 2-liter of pop & a gallon of milk in one single bag--nope, no double bagging at this GE. \n\nI'm not even asking for joyful cashiers. I'm asking for cashiers who say HELLO, your total is, & thank you/have a nice day. Most of the time, I'm the one to say have a nice day, & I don't even get a shrug or eye contact. I feel like turnover rate here is high too, because I rarely see the same people twice. They clearly aren't firing people for their lack of friendliness or speediness; so they must all be quitting."
1,"My family and I were in the mood for shaved ice and our water and ice spot was closed, we found this spot and we are hooked!!! The owner made us some samples and was super friendly, all of his flavors are from Hawaii and it is the best place to get a cold treat.  Give this place a try and see how great it is!!"
1,Authentic Mexican Food w a organic twist!  \n\nYou can always judge a Mexican restaurant by their salsa & tortillas- this place makes both from scratch! \n\nDoesn't get any better - stop by and enjoy some real Mexican food in the valley.
0,"Eh...I really WANT to like this place, but it's become a little run down over the years.  I would jump at the opportunity to go to a \""true\"" gay sports bar, but this place just doesn't cut it.  It really needs to be about 1000 sq feet bigger to achieve the sports bar feel.  Plus they have these really old circa 1991 TV's to watch sports. (A costco run for some LCDs would go a long way here).   Beer is beer. When people play darts the place get's even smaller.  If only they would get the gay sports leaugues to commit to going there on a more regular basis...it's so hit or miss. \n    This place has SOOOO much potential, but it seems the owners are very happy with the status quo."
0,"Ichi Ban means number one. Ichi = One; Ban = Number. This place is actually deceiving because it's not number one, its number last. \n\nLanguage lesson aside, this place can be summed up in three words; Poor quality sushi. \n\nI had take out yesterday and this place was just nearby my hotel. I got the sukiyaki and sushi combo and both the sukiyaki and sushi was sub par. The sukiyaki was wrapped twice, which was nice for take out but it actually tasted like crap. The sushi was also of a lesser quality so I was just disappointed in general. Maybe it's because I'm from NorCal but this kind of place should not be charging what it does for this combo. It was 20 bucks but for the quality, it should be 10-15 bucks. The other nice thing that I noticed while I was there was that they had sake bomb combos which is nice, because drinking is always awesome. You would probably need the drinks to mask the poor quality of the food. Probably explains why the place was largely empty."
1,"This is one of my favorite malls, period.  Don't let the presence of Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom throw you; there is plenty here for the budget minded as well as the high end customer.  Every major category of merchandise is represented here, save for major appliances, and there are already plenty of places to get those anyway.\n\nMy favorite stores for bargains are the seemingly least likely places to look.  I love going to SouthPark and checking the sale racks at Belk (it's a four level showplace with everything you can think of; it puts my local Belk stores to shame) Dillard's, Nordstrom, Sur la Table (kitchen wares, pronounced sur la tab), The Art of Shaving (men's grooming products), Crate & Barrel and any number of other upscale stores that have \""killer\"" sales and clearances.  \n\nIf all else fails, you can eat. This mall boasts a major food court along with several sit-down restaurants and in-store restaurants at Nordstrom and Belk."
1,"If your doing a trade show or just need to relax or workout this is your new best friend. I couldn't make it through ConExpo without recharging each morning per my chiropractors recommendations. Hot tub, steam room, cold tub all excellent. Gilbert is very helpful, all staff is excellent. Standing on the hot tub seat provides excellent pain relief to legs, calves and feet. Best kept secret. Get there early, you'll feel like you own the place. Thanks very much folks!"
1,"After a drunken stopper at some pool party.  Came back for a quick bite.  decided on the steak sandwich and a chocolate chip cookie.  Both exceptional, cookie was soft and moist and super chocolatey.  More cafe-ish.\nService was ultra friendly and helpful."
0,"I was wound up like a little girl all day waiting and waiting to go to our 8:20pm showing of Polar Express in 3D at the IMAX.  I had seen the movie when it came out and loved it.  I'm pretty much a sucker for anything Tom Hanks does.  I knew it was a great movie, but I was on pins and needles waiting to see it with my hubby.  It was his first time to see the magic of the movie or a one in 3D at an IMAX.\n\nThe magic was washed away as soon as I stepped into the holding area to the theatre.  It was a dreary, depressing, uncomfortable place to wait until the theatre doors were ready.  I saw that there was popcorn, MY FAVORITE PART OF A MOVIE, but it I wasn't hit with the scent of seduction when I walked in.  To me, that means old, cold popcorn.  Grrr.\n\nAfter our tickets were taken, we made our way through the filthy hall to our seats.  Oh yeah- they are assigned.  What's up with that?  Luckily, there weren't many people so we sat where we wanted without a problem.  The seats were stained with God knows what, arm rests were broken, seats were broken.  It was disgusting.  I have been in multiple IMAX theaters in Florida and they have all been pristine!  Where, exactly, is my $15.00 going?\n\nThe sound is amazing, the screen is awesome and 3D is incredible.  That's the only thing they've got going for them.\n\nAfter I left, I was thrilled with the movie but I felt like I needed to have a lice screening."
0,"THIS IS FOR HAPPY HOUR ONLY...\n\nMcCormick's is a sold chian seafood restaurant.  I've dined here for full dinner several times and the food is typically well prepared, if unimaginative.\n\nHappy Hour runs Monday through Friday until 6:30pm with drink and food specials in the bar and front section of the restaurant.  We arrived at 6pm on a Fridayy night, and it was standing room only in the bar, but we were able to grab one of the \""happy hour\"" tables in the main dining room.  There are about a dozen items on the HH food menu, including a $2.95 half pound cheeseburger.  Prices range from $1.95 to $4.95.\n\nWe ordered fish tacos ($1.95 for 2), ceviche ($1.95), cheeseburger sliders ($4.95 for 3), sweet potato fries ($3.95), Ahi tostadas ($4.95), and steamed mussles ($2.95).  The fish tacos were two dry corn tortillas with one piece of blackened fish in each.  There was cabbage and tomato on the plate which we put on top.  They weren't terrible.  The ceviche has a thick tomato base and tasted more like ketchup than anything.  Mussels were stringy and chewy.  They looked dried out despite being cooked in a white wine broth.  The sliders were GREAT.  Soft rolls, grilled onions, cooked medium.  The Ahi Tostadas were also great; three peices of seared Ahi on fried wonton wrappers topped with purple cabbage and a sesame dressing.  Sweet potato friens are sweet potato fries.  They were hot, crispy and plentiful.\n\nThere were no liquor specials listed on the happy hour menu, only beer and wine specials.  I had a $5 champagne cocktail and hubby ordered a $4.50 beer.\n\nNext time, I think we'll stick with the things they seemed to do well, which are also the more expensive offerings.  The service was smooth and attentive.  The atmosphere is not high energy or exciting.  This is a place to eat and go, not to hang out and people watch or chat."
1,Went for the cocktails Friday night and for dinner Saturday night. Please make a reservation as there are always people outside lined up to eat. There were 2 groups waiting in line and my brother and I had reservations and they got seated before we did.\n\nThe waitstaff is friendly and courteous. The food is delicious and the cocktail menu leaves you wanting to drink more.
1,Christian and Co are fantastic. We've been regulars since 2009 and drove from Wickenburg. Best service of all the CS we have frequented in WI and AZ
1,"\""Dees\"" dang donuts are too good! Three of us ate the entire dozen by lunchtime. The donuts were fresh and the service was quick and efficient. We will go back! So yummy!!"
1,"Vegas isn't the best town to see bands in. mainly becuase, if its not mainstream radio, odds are we are ignored. but when a band does come, odds are it is to the Joint. I have seen many shows here, Muse, Interpol, Death Cab for Cutie, Vampire Weekend, Snow Patrol, The Beastie Boys, Wolfmother, and I could go on. Whats great is that you can always get down close to the band, without really having to push your way through people, which i wont do, but many people do anyways. This is becuase of the 3 leveled floors. But the common theme of almost all shows ive seen here has been dicks. i have seen a number of fights (at fairly peaceful bands), People are always smoking, spilling drinks, and having no regard for those around them. but thats vegas people, not the joint. so i cant knock it down for that. But the venue is clean, rarely sells out (once again, vegas music scene, not the joint), and lets you get close to really good bands."
1,"Great food and perfect evening! I love the Salmon Fiorintino, delicious every time and the portions are big, I had half of it for lunch the next day. We also enjoyed the Zucchini fries....yummy! \n\nLovely ambiance for a date night or if you just need a night to kick back and enjoy some great food!"
0,"Food and service OK, but this was the filthiest Denny's we've seen. We were one of only two parties seated at dinnertime on a Sunday night. There must have been 6 un-bussed un-cleaned tables. The bathrooms (mens, womens) obviously had not been cleaned or attended to all day as there was trash all over the floor. The toilet paper roll was on the floor (the roll holder was broken), and there was no soap or hot water available (we reported this to the health dept.)\n\nDo yourself a favor and eat at the 4* Chuck Wagon Restaurant in the Longhorn Casino 100 yards to the north. The only reason we visited this Denny's was that the Longhorn was crowded."
0,"So overall my visit was okay at best. My waitress was friendly, she was good on refilling drinks. Now I don't know who to really blame for the slow service on everything else. My waitress to start got my order wrong. I ordered steak quesadilla received chicken. Normally I wouldn't make a fuss but when your craving one thing something else just won't cut it. Especially since I'm paying $10 for quesadilla come on I don't think it's that hard. Needless to say I had to wait a ridiculous amount of time for them to correct my order. And since they took so long my kids finished their meals before I even got mine. My husband waited for me so by the time I got my food his was cold. so then the waitress brings the check and goes oh did he come by? I'm like no no one came by. And she goes oh well he took the order off. Okay cool. I look at the check no they did not. They took off the chicken quesadilla order and did nothing to compensate messing up my order and taking forever to receive my food. Then we go to pay using their machine and it tried to add a 20% tip. Ummm no sorry I changed that to 0%. Sorry but she could of accommodated us more for her mistake. Also beware of those machine if you have kids at the table. They charge for games and don't even tell you  it will cost you money."
1,"this place was FABULOUS!\n\nits a chic and very VERY relaxing environment with wonderful art and music!\n\ni originally wanted a chicken liver salad, but they were out of it so i thought i'd try their pigeon breast salad. the waitor came back and told me they had just got in some freshly smoked duck and if i wanted that insteas. i couldnt' decide so they made me a specialty salad with both!\n\nprobably the best salad i have ever had in my entire life! (pigeon breast was ok... kinda like unsalted ham) the Smoked duck was to Die for!\n\nmy Papa had a lamb stew with a very tender and flavorful helpin' of lamb in it!\n\na Must!"
0,"We've been here three times. I had sliders twice and a steak once. The slider are ok but nothing to write home about. The big disappointment was the steak. It was cooked fine an the quality of meat was ok, but the cooking method could use work. Traditionally, a steak is seared on both aides to give it a crust and then finished to desired temperature in the oven. It tasted like this one was done in the oven the entire time so it ha no crisp crust. Just a warm mush.\n\nThe drink menu is very large and creative. However, they're very inconsistent with how drinks are made. Ive had the same drink all three times and it changes significantly each time.\n\nThis place is also a little pricey if you order anything but finger foods. A steak. \n\nOverall, with more consistency and quality control this could be a really good place. As it stands now, we'd rather eat at another close by restaurant with a wait than be seated at this place immediately."
1,"Food is awesome here, always long waits to get in. My favorite sushi place in Vegas"
1,"Great little place for date night! LAMP Pizzeria definitely has the nicest \""fancy\"" pizza in the Cave Creek/North Scottsdale area. It's wood fired and they use quality ingredients. Is it the best pizza I've every had, or even in the Top 5? No, but for the area, it's a fantastic choice and I definitely will be bringing family who visit here and going back for dinners with my husband. \n\nThe white wine sangria was fun and came full of fruit (grapes & oranges). I really liked the Grape & Gorgonzola salad because it was big, fresh, and filling. My husband and I split The Simple pizza and really liked it - good crust, good sauce, good cheese, good olive oil. Two drinks each, a salad, and a pizza runs about $50.\n\nThe place is cute. We sat outside, and though it's in a strip mall, the patio is in a courtyard setting with big string lights above. Wish they could get misters out there for the summer, but they have heat lamps for cooler nights. The courtyard faces west so you can see the sky change colors as the sun sets. The only bummer is that they don't have cocktails, but there is a place right next door that serves those."
0,"Careful !  They tack on an extra $17 per night for a bogus \""service fee\"".  If have very little tolerance for deception.  This place was deceptive."
0,"Me and my boyfriend shop here all of the time. Usually have great customer service except today...our cashier Katina was very nice..deserves recignition...there was another lady on the other hand who was very rude to us. We had purchased 2 12 packs of Pabst beer, which are usually on sale for $6.99. There was a sign posted which said $6.99..they rang up regular price. The rude lady stated that she would not change it because the sign was wrong and should have been taken down. (She saId this very rudely)  Ummm excuse me...we believe people should honor the price that's up..it was their mistake not ours. The cashier Katina was sweet enough to call the manager up to refund us the difference."
0,If you like waiting 40 mins before getting any food and watching your waiter shoot the breeze with another waiter this is the place to go.
0,Everything is way too greasey for my taste!
0,"I wish there was a way to give them a 0 or negative score. I have read through most of the reviews below mine and have come to find I'm having the same problem with them. My amazon package tracker says my package has been delivered, but I haven't seen anything for two days. I called them two days ago to inquire about my package and they said they would send out the driver tomorrow (today) by 5pm to verify he dropped it at the wrong place and they would call me back. I never received a call. I called them back today and spoke to a woman who said she'd contact the driver and get right back to me. An hour went by and, nothing. I called back and I spoke with a Jaime. She told me that there wasn't even a record of me calling today, only yesterday. She contacted the driver and told me that the driver verified he was at the right address and left a delivery slip. There was never any OnTrac slip found near my apartment. So either the drivers a liar or dropped it at the wrong address. I doubt he dropped it at the wrong address because I took the time to go to every apt. complex in my area with the same apt. # to inquire. NOTHING! I asked to speak with the driver myself to verify personally he had the right address. Jaime told me there is no way I can contact him and she can't guarantee he will call me, and basically there's nothing she can do. The package I ordered is for my husbands birthday and is a product that is constantly out of stock, so I cannot simply call Amazon and tell them to ship me a new one. I will be reporting this company to the Better Business Bureau in the morning with a link to this page and I suggest the rest of you do the same."
0,"Complete surprise that they would expect us to pay $20.00 a beer if we are not playing more than $20.00 on the bar top machines. Are they serious ?\nLast time at this gold digging of a bar.... doesn't mean just coz i'm hanging out in the Cosmopolitan, I'm ready to throw $20 bills at you for a beer.....at least give me a lap dance !!!"
1,"I don't know how long they've had deep dish slices, but I've never seen them until this recent visit.  \n\nWe grabbed up a pepperoni deep dish which was pretty decent, but not close to my favorite. The plus is that its nicely crispy and not doughy, lots of pepperoni  and sauce and cheese in it. Its much more filling than the thin slice so I suppose you get more bang for your buck with that.  \n\nWe got a slice of white pizza as well. This is one of my favorites here and the BF liked it a lot too. Its also good with their sliced sausage on it. I think if you wan't something besides a basic pepperoni, I think this is the best one they have to offer. Slices start at $4.50 for a already made slice or you can order in a whole pizza as well (I believe the last time I ordered one it was about $20ish for a 1 topping). Of course, having it fresh made is slightly better than getting a slice that's been sitting. They serve a few beers on tap or soda, and there is a water dispenser out with water cups. Other than that, they serve nothing else - just 'za! \n\nI think the \""secret pizza\"" is not so secret, but if you aren't sure where it is, it's on the same floor as most of their restaurants. It's right next to Blue Ribbon Sushi, you'll just see a random corridor of albums and you'll see a arcade machine visible at the end. Theres some stools or standing bar. You can walk your slice out into lobby of this area as there's plenty of seating and a pool table even. \n\nGood quick bite when here in Cosmo, a good idea to order a pizza instead of room service, not something I would venture to the strip just to get though. Still, I am a fan and manage to end up here every time I'm on the property!"
0,"I'd say 2.5 stars. Decent but odd dining room. Food is better than the looks of the place would lead you to believe. \nIf you're just interested in good food this place will fit the bill. If you're looking for more of an \""experience\"" then another place may be better suited for what you are looking for."
1,This is my neighborhood Moe's in Ballantyne Village. I come here about once a month and get the junior Art Vandalay (good option for a vegetarian). The service is always prompt and friendly. The place is usually pretty clean. No complaints. Good place to run in and grab a quick bite.
1,Good Food and Great Service.
1,"Having spent the last 10 days in Portland, we came back to Phoenix lamenting about the creative food scene here - why can't Phoenix have more of 'that'! Well here you go - Short Leash Sit...Stay is what we're talking about. We had the corn dog bits appetizer with spicy mustard and a Devil Dog - with spicy beer hot dog. The food pops! Wonderful! The corn dog bits were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of batter, and the hot dog wrapped in flat bread was an amazing mix of spicy flavors. All the hot dogs on the menu sounded delicious. We will be back. Love the owners mission: \""eating well and surrounding yourself with people who make you happy\"" - mission accomplished. Highly recommended."
0,"What a mess!!! Looking for outdoor fabric and this place is close to home, so it was our first stop. No outdoor fabric could be found, but in fairness, I am not the type of person that likes to \""hunt\"" for things. I'm more of a get in get out kinda girl, and this store is most definitely NOT conducive to that way of shopping.\n\nAfter a quick circle around the shop, we went and asked where the outdoor fabric is. Answer: \""if we have it, I would think it's near the upholstery\"". If? Think? We circled again but there is zero organization in the place, and I was shopping with someone that doesn't have patience for that, so we quickly left. \n\nAlso, crowded and dirty. If they had organization, training, and a mop, they would get more business. They could even raise prices. But, I'm sure there are people that would rather dig and shop in a less fancy place to save the money, and if that's you, this is a good place. Never thought I would feel like a fabric store snob, but I guess that's me."
0,"Absolute terrible experience. First time visiting with a friend, and I was looking at some items. I playfully touched my friend on her side, and the lady working kicked me out without an explanation. Apparently my \""behavior\"" made the lady uncomfortable. This was their reply to me when I emailed them and complained that I was offended, embarrassed and shocked at how I was treated when it was my first time there,\n\n\"" I would like to apologize for any additional stress that this situation has caused you. I assure you that this in not a normal occurrence at Frances and our customers are our first priority.\n     We have reviewed the security tape several times and spoke multiple times with our employee regarding the incident.  It seems as though our employee felt uncomfortable with some of the behavior going on between you and your friend.

1,California burrito with chicken! Bomb!
1,"So I come here for 3 things: the splash pad, Menchie's, and H&M. Oh, and I have been to the Apple Store also, so I guess 4 things. The splash pad is awesome for the kiddos because it is nice and shaded by huge palm trees. There is a nice blend of retail clothing shops, jewelry stores, restaurants, and specialty stores to keep most people happy. A few other fun places are Make Meaning and iPic if you really want something special. Nice misters make the hot summer days a bit cooler. It is like a street taken out of Beverly Hills and transplanted into the middle of Scottsdale."
1,"Always a fun place--we prefer the patio, even on the hottest days. It's in the shade. Check in on Foursquare for complimentary edamame appetizer."
0,"Went here one night for a birthday dinner with a few friends.  To say we were unimpressed, would be an understatement.  Several items that we ordered we were told that they were out of.  The food was good but not great.  Two of us ordered the side wedge salad with our meal.  We laughed when it actually came on our plate. For the prices on the menu, this place needs to step it up."
1,Best burger in Phoenix. They have a great beer selection too.
0,Same experience as other Yelpers. Order is usually WRONG in one way or the other. Won't return here!
1,Super nice staff!  Food is delicious! So Fresh !  I always sppreciate the hostess asks if we have preferred sesting.  Such a simple question but so appreciated.  Thankyou Madeleine. Having never eaten there before our waiter John was very helpful. He helped us make the best choices for our appetites and tastes!
1,As a local I stop here every time I go to Caesars.   Black truffle and artichoke soup.  Guy is awesome!
1,Pete is amazing he showed up quickly diagnosed the problem and found an affordable solution.\n\nI had a set of kitchen drawers that the glides had broken off the back wall. He repaired them in under an hour for the 4 drawers.\n\nOutstanding service at a great price.....
1,"My wife picked up a to-go order of Cab Rangoon, Sesame Chicken, and Spicy Ground Beef Noodles (My Fav!).\n\nOMG!!!\n\nMy food was amazing, even though it had been sitting at home for well over 2 hours before I got to it.  The flavors were rich and bursting with flavor.  I drenched my meal with nam pla prik....wow was it delicious!!!  Highly recommended!"
1,"Good tangy pepperoni pizza, amazing garlic knots! Friendly service although the guys here give me a hard time :p"
1,"This place is super cute and has pretty great American inspired food with offbeat, non-traditional twists and playful flavor.  Their mac n' cheese is fantastic and I love how they strive to base their menu off organic and small farm produce and meats.  I'd recommend to try anything with poultry, especially the turkey meatballs. I've been here for dinner and brunch a few times and definitely plan to return.  \nThe decor is fun french country chic and makes for a great outing with friends. Also, be sure to try the salt scrub they have available in the restrooms to wash your hands!  It's fantastic!\nThe reason why I am not scoring a full 5 stars is because sometimes the table set up during busy hours are a bit to close together and make for a little awkward dining experience.  And the staff is super friendly and courteous, but sometimes lack proper knowledge of dishes when you ask questions and their serving etiquette could use some work."
0,This may be the most over rated place ever!  OMG the stuff is so absolutely average at best. The staff when you walk in remixed me of an episode of restaurant stakeout. I tried it but I won't be back.
1,Round 2 but happy hour this time  if youre serious about no frills and no trend sushi go here now or regret your existence!!! Another bomb.com experience here! Please go here now!!!!\n\n\n\n*****NO FIREARMS ALLOWED*****
0,"If a negative review was possible, I would give this restaurant one! Coming from out of town, I wanted to try this place out. MAN!!!!!!! That was a BIG MISTAKE! I found it convenient and order the food through yelp and set the food to be picked up at 7:30 pm. I received a voice message from a rude employee at 7:17 pm, informing me my food was ready to be picked up, but yet, I set the pick up at 7:30! I called the restaurant back and the rude employee answered. I explained, I would be there shortly. Upon arrival, the rude idiot asked me \""why you late fo yo pick up?!?!?\"" I replied, \""my order was set at 7:30, to pick up!\"" He answered back \""well..... We make it at 7:00\"" (pointless stupid coment) while he was explaining, he looked to the detailed invoice of my order and circled the time its set to be picked up and said \""see it say seven.......... Oh?\"" Immediately, the employee felt completely DUMB! Instead of apologizing, the employee blatantly covered his IGNORANCE for arrogance! I asked \""well.... Dont you think the food is cold by now?\"" In his immediate defense, he pointlessly started check marking specific foods on the invoice of items I ordered, on what items would be warm or not (AGAIN, stupidity at its best!) I would of accepted his apology and went about my night, but since this moron was spitting pointless nonsense-full verbiage, to make him look more dumber than he really is! This made me immensely frustrated and was seriously considering throwing the food in his face. I arrived to North LV, from a long drive from Californian and all I wanted to do was eat. This person is the face of this establishment and SHOULD really consider pulling the stick out of his ass, for the customers and business sake. Over all, the food was ok and nothing out of the ordinary. YELPERS, STAY AWAY FROM THIS BUSINESS. If you dont mind being treated rude and would consider mundane food; that would be totally up to you!"
0,"My wife's wallet was stolen while she was in class.  The studio provides no security for valuables other than \""cubbies.\""  Either someone came into the studio from the outside or someone in her 4:00 to 5:30 PM class stole her wallet.  Supposedly there is always someone at the front desk, so the filthy scumbag thief is probably someone in her class.  This scumbag tried to ring up  charges on my wife's debit card at CVS and at a Shell station, but Bank of America declined them.  Next they tried her Mastercard and charged $161 at Walgreens and another $59 at Virgin Mobile.  Then they used her Visa card to for another $300 in charges.  All cards are cancelled scumbag and the charges reversed.\n\nWe had to spend several hours on the phone with the police, credit reporting agencies, bank, and credit card companies.  Even worse, my wife lost precious, irreplaceable pictures of her deceased father.  \n\nDue to the lack of security for valuables, I would not recommend this business and am encouraging my wife to NEVER go back."
0,The service was really good.  The food wasn't.  The rice tasted like it had been made hours before and kept in a warmer.  It was clumpy and not good.  The rest of the food did not taste like it was freshly prepared.  Very disappointed.  The server was really nice though.
1,"Some of the best sushi I've had. Both of us enjoyed it. The fried rice had pineapple, which was different but surprisingly delicious. The prices at first seemed a bit high, then we found the happy hour menu and were very happy with the prices, especially with the quality."
1,"Honestly all the negative reviews on here are pretty lame.\nThis store is huge, but doesn't have a lot of employees and rightly so.\nI come here all the time and NEVER have I seen more than 5 people shopping at once.\nGet off your high horse and stop being a douche just because the guy at the checkout counter didn't talk you deaf and the girl in the front didn't fake-greet you.\nYou are coming to a sporting good store, get what you want, look around, play if you want to and stop bitching because you aren't a queen.\nIf you wanted to be treated like a princess then go to the salon (or victorias secret because they will greet you 8 times within three footsteps in the door).\n\n\n\nANYWAYS.\nI come here quite a few times a year and I actually like that they only ask a few times if you need help because I like to look around.\nCame to buy a polar watch and saw other watches around.\nAsked an associate the differences she told me and suggested the right one for me. ANNND she was definitely right.\nBought it very fast (only one other person in line) and scidaddled."
1,"I am still a sushi novice and remain in the calm waters of the California roll and salmon rolls - occasionally Philadelphia and Las Vegas....meeting up with Ebony K. she attempted to move me a little more off the wall. I went as far as the rainbow roll and looked at her Unagi Roll...not going that far yet. She is a sushi fan and far more adventurous than I am - she might try a Kraken if they could catch it and put it in a nice hand cut roll - and if it's happy hour, then it's on!\n\nWe sat in the back and it was nice and quiet at first, but soon on a Saturday night the place was packed. I will recommend the drinks - she had a pomegranate martini, which was good - but my watermelon martini was phenomenal! \n\nThe service was good, the sushi was fresh, and the atmosphere was excellent. Getting a table wasn't bad - 5pm on Saturday night and we walked right in - later in the evening there was a wait. Parking in that part of Scottsdale is always a challenge. It might be best to just pay the $5 valet and let them worry about finding the spot."
1,"\""Irasshaimase!\"" - oh yeah, this is going to be some good ramen, I have a good feeling about this one.\n\nThe greetings are loud and welcoming from the entire staff of Monta Chaya. After doing a search for ramen on Yelp, I narrowed things down to a few and this was my first choice based on the menu.\n\nThe menu is simple and true to a few styles of authentic Japanese ramen - Tonkatsu, Shoyu or Miso. What truly drew me in was the claim of homemade Tonkatsu - pork bone soup simmered for hours.\n\nWe ordered one Tonkatsu with a seasoned egg and my wife the Spicy Tonkatsu with corn. So a small pork belly on rice.\n\nTonkatsu was spot on! Thick rich savory broth with thin ramen noodles and traditional Japanese ramen garnishes. The seasoned egg is awesome, runny with a firm delectable outer white and adds the perfect additional element to the soup. \n\nThe spicy Tonkatsu was not really spicy, more of a chili flavor. My wife agreed that the corn was not a good choice to add. I think the corn would be better on the miso. \n\nHello pork belly! The pork belly on rice was so good that we both agreed that it would make a stellar stand alone meal. The pork is soft and savory, the fatty juices flavoring the rice underneath and the pickled ginger on top the perfect compliment.\n\nOn the table is the full spread of condiments to make your ramen your own. I love the chili oil, sesame and chili powder with a dash of vinegar.\n\nSlurp loudly to show appreciation for your ramen as done in Japan! \n\nOn the way out the door, the staff erupts in an enthusiastic \""Arigato Gozimashta!!!\""\n\nWe will be back, the miso looks amazing :)\n\nAloha!"
0,"As seen on tv, but not nearly as sexy as you've seen on tv. First of all, the place is a complete dump in a really sketchy hood. When we drove by early in the morning, we saw at least 150 people lined up outside to get in and we were not willing to do that. We came back around 6:30 and there were like 8 people waiting, so we decided to check it out. \n\nI am not a fan of buying junk eeeerrrr pawned treasures. That being said, I didn't find much of anything that I would waste my money on. A few cool sports items, but way over priced. A few decent watches, but way overpriced. For example, if I want an Omega watch, why would I pay $2,800 for a used one that's scratched up and in terrible shape? I mean if that's your thing, by all means, get down with it. But for me, that's not how I roll. \n\nNote to staff, ever hear of the new and improved Swiffer jet? Time to mix in a cruise through the place with a vacuum or a dust buster. The place is just nasty. \n\n\n- If you expect to see Big Hoss, Old Man, Rick or Chum, don't count on it. You will see a bunch of bald guys, just not THE bald guy. You will see a few old men just not THE old man. \n\n-It's pretty much a gift shop with schwag for you to waste your money on. So, if you are in the market for a Big Hoss bobblehead doll, you have come to the right place. If you just can't live another day without a t shirt with Chums face on it, you are in luck.\n\nI love the show and this place is so much more exciting on my tv screen than it is in person."
0,"I came here many years ago and used to love it. My family and I came here recently and the meat was TOO salty. We thought it was a one time thing and decided to go again, and again the meat was too salty and two of us got sick. \nWhatever you guys did, change it back!!!"
0,"5 words...get out while you can!!!! It smells like ass, it's in the hood, and I'm pretty sure 1/3 of the customer base are on some form of drugs. They need to call HAZMAT in and declare it a hazard zone. Wish me luck...I'm going home to take a bath in bleach to try to get some of this rancid stank off of me."
0,"Seriously the dumbest dining experience ever. My first visit consisted of 10lbs of pasta with 2 tablespoons of sauce (not what I wanted clearly). My mom wanted to go again a few months later so I was like ok im willing to give it another chance. My second visit consisted of 3 rude people as I made my way down the line to make my pasta bowl,  the same pasta to sauce ratio, & oh goodie cold toppings. I literally looked at this slop of goulash they just served me and wondered why the h*** between my mother and I it was almost 30 bucks. I honestly would have been happier with McDonald's slug nuggets from the 90's before they were \""all white meat\"" and an apple pie. Don't waste your time at this place."
1,My wife and I ate here this evening for our 15th anniversary.  The interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations. The menu had also changed with some items doubling in price.  A coworker of my wife had given her a $25 gift card for Christmas.\nWe ordered sweet teas and a Bloomin onion. The onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning.  My wife had the chicken tenders and I had the pork tenderloin.  It wa a good but wasn't outstanding. At one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table. He didn't introduce himself. He asked about our meal and disappeared. I told the waiter about him. We were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the French toast bread pudding looked delicious.
1,"Lucky to stumble into the Onyx Bar when Daniel Park was performing.  Is there no end to this guy's talent?  Maroon 5, Coldplay, Bruno  -- he can do 'em all -- and he has his own amazing tunes, too.  Releasing a new CD in September.  Anyway, back to the bar.  It's a favorite for meeting up with friends or on a date.  Caveat:  It's not cheap, but you get entertainment with drinks.  One shot of Grand Marnier with a bottle of water is $21, plus tip.  Their Side Car will knock you sideways if you're not careful, it's cinnamoney smooth."
1,"Every town should have a hole-in-the wall bakery full of decadent pastries and rustic breads.  Mirabelle fills that need in Urbana.\n\nStopped by this afternoon to get a chocolate dipped almond horn, coffee, and rosemary and sea salt focaccia.  The focaccia was purchased to bring my total over $5 so I could use my card (darn minimum purchases...).  A little annoying, but I can understand why small businesses put those rules in place.  And I guess I won't complain about being \""forced\"" to buy more delicious baked goods.\n\nI thought the coffee was tasty (better than I was expecting) and it paired perfectly with the almond horn, which was also delicious.  It wasn't the most amazing almond horn I've ever had...but yeah, it was most definitely yummy.  Just about everything in the display case looked wonderful so I hope to sample more of their pastries.\n\nThe focaccia was also good, warmed in the oven and served with dinner.  Would probably go really well with a salad or as sandwich bread...mmm.\n\nI do wish the seating wasn't quite so awkward, but I guess it's the best they can do.\n\nNot sure why people are complaining that they are closed on Mondays.  I've yet to find a traditional bakery that ISN'T closed on Mondays."
0,"Great but the days and times they are open are completely unpredictable. There is a pool schedule online, but clearly they never adhere to it. Today, I took my 2-year-old and 6-year-old niece here because the online schedule said it was open from 10 am until 6 pm. Imagine our surprise and disappointment when we drove for 30 minutes only to discover a sign changing the pool hours to 1 pm until 5 pm. \nTheir failure to update their schedule means that we are unable to plan accordingly and my nieces are heartbroken when they can't swim. A little consideration goes a long way"
1,"I am fan. We finally went here after many years of just driving by. It is not very impressive by the look of it, but the food is really good. Order the Posada items, they are really yummy. The service is good. the salsa is really good. We will go back again. The price is right."
1,"Le menu est vari\u00e9. Il y a des plats travaill\u00e9s comme l'osso-bucco, le foie de veau, les rognons, etc...\nJ'ai pris la table d'h\u00f4te avec la salade au balsamique. Simple et bon. Ensuite, j'ai pris les lasagnes \u00e0 la viande effiloch\u00e9e \u00e0 l'huile d'olive et parmesan. Tr\u00e8s bon mais j'aurais aim\u00e9 go\u00fbter un peu plus le parmesan. Le dessert : un g\u00e2teau au fromage (tr\u00e8s bien) mais j'ai pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 le dessert de ma femme (une tarte au pomme avec de la cr\u00e8me glac\u00e9e semifredo et une sauce au caramel, genre de tarte tatin un peu)\nLe tiramisu de mon ami par contre n'en \u00e9tait pas un. Il le dresse \u00e0 la fin en mettant les biscuits \u00e0 la cuill\u00e8re d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 un peu dur et de l'autre le m\u00e9lange mascarpone qui est plut\u00f4t liquide.

1,"Originally went here because of a restaurant.com certificate.\n\nThe place was busy, but we received great service from our servers, and the food was good.\n\nWe had the thin crust Monster pizza - yum!"
1,"I've decided I will not let any other place touch my hair. Manny's is amazing. I always get a KILLER awesome haircut, and the price is reasonable too. The location has changed since this entry was made... Manny's has moved to a much bigger, nicer location at: 811 W. University Dr. 101 Mesa, 85201. Phone number is still the same - (480) 464-4403 \nManny and Blanca do GREAT work, along with the rest of the staff!"
1,Went to this location yesterday for Happy Hour! The crab cakes were very good! The lite Cosmo was made perfectly! Very good selection of appetizers half off during happy hour. Just wish it lasted until 7 or later ;)
0,"It has been a long time since I went to this restaurant but I just joined yelp today so this is sort of a retroactive review. I decided to write this because my experience here was so bad. This incredibly expensive restaurant REFUSED TO GIVE US GLASSES OF WATER. THEY INSISTED THAT WE BUY WATER. For real. They serve spicy Thai food and refuse to give you a glass of water, you have to buy bottled water. I was so mad that I went and filled our water glasses from the tap in the bathroom. I have never been back to this restaurant since. My impression of this place is that is is run by inhospitable and greedy people."
0,"The worst buffet of all time!!!!! Need I say more?? \n \nFirst off, we passed here a few times while staying at Bally's, each time we passed the line was RIDICULOUS!! So we kept walking...well one morning waking up hungover & starving we decided to head for the closest buffet in hopes that it wouldn't be too long of a wait, after all it was a Thursday morning!! We get there and it was the shortest we had seen, YES, SCORE! ...NOT!!! We get in line & pay rather quickly but after you pay you wait....& wait..... & wait....& wait some more!!! They are smart, they make you pay before you realize how long you really have to wait!! So we finally get almost to the front, the hostess takes the party of 2 that's ahead of us to a table but NEVER RETURNS!!!!!! We stood there about 15 minutes in the front of the line!!  While we stood there wondering if she would ever return we saw a few waitresses pass by, a manager pass twice, another worker come answer the phone & argue with a customer on the phone...not one of those people said \""is anyone helping you?\"" Or \""sorry about the wait\"" or \""someone will be right with you\""! Really?! What kind of manager walks by with no care of how his guests are being taken care of! At one point I said to my husband lets just go seat ourselves, Who would notice??? NO ONE!!!! Finally a different hostess comes from behind us in the line to start her shift, the other hostess had left on break or something with no one covering her!!! There were about 20 empty tables, SOMEONE could've sat us!! ......anyways as you can tell I was furious with this \""service\"" (especially after spending 22.99 a person) !!! \n\nMoving on to the food... I thought please Paris redeem yourself with this food!! Nope...terrible! It's like they are trying too hard to be fancy...the food Is roasted potatoes, garlic Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, Mac & cheese, sausages, pork & a few other random things. It was all gross! The best thing Is the ice cream, if you do decide that you just have to go here, get the ice cream.\n\nIn addition I've been to plenty of buffets in Vegas this is by far THE WORST!!"
1,"Came here during my previous trip with the bf. Solid French food all around and reasonable prices (def better than Bouchon).\n\nMain appetizers were the escargots w/butter and mussels.  Not bad, but I've had better escargots and mussels (both lacking flavor).\n\nBF got the special fish of the day which came w/a hearty side of fresh and yummy veggies. Don't remember what kind of fish, but it was moist and tender. Dish was $28\n\nI ordered the sea scallops. There were 5 and they were cooked just right. 2nd best to the ones I ate at Gary Danko in SF. \n\nService was exceptional.  Server was attentive enough, but gave me space. No pressure to order the most expensive items on the menu. Water was filled when low and bread was replenished when asked. Basic things but sometimes people don't do it!\n\nCan't wait to come back during my next Vegas trip! :)"
1,Delicious. This was our first visit since Thai Rama has been closed and we were not disappointed.The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The Tom Kah soup was some of the best I've ever had and the lemon infused water was a nice touch. We also had the sweet and sour chicken which was kinda meh but everything else was quite tasty. We will be back for sure.
0,"Expensive.\n\nThe food was okay, but it was just so dang expensive.  $12 for 10 wings.  Okay wings.  If they were good, I wouldn't mind.  But they were just okay.  Took forever to bring the extra ranch we requested, resulting in either ranchless wings or cold wings.  :(\n\nOrdered the pulled pork sandwich... $15.  $15!!!  Again, it was jsut okay... I've had much better for half the price!!!"
1,"Its 102 degrees, you're hungover to all hell and are in need of something low key to pass your time until you're ready to do it all over again that night.  It's way to hot to tan by the pool, and after the $$$ spent the night before, shopping wasn't on my mind.  For us, Bodies was a more interesting and air conditioned alternative than wandering the strip or watching the Bellagio fountains over and over again. (I was super hungover alright?! The options were limited.)\n\nI was doubtful that anything interesting or productive could have come out of that depressing, smelly and lonely casino, The Tropicana.  However, my boyfriend reasurred me that there would be a reward at the end of this walk through possibly the most joyless place in Vegas.\n \nHe was right, there was.  The bodies are actually very interesting to inspect- they're right out in the open, not behind glass.  The controversy behind them is also an interesting subject to research (most of the bodies were former Chinese prisoners).  They had a very intriguing section about the development of human fetuses...not for everyone, but interesting for me.\n\nI also appreciated that we were able to walk through the exhibit at our own speed, rather than being hurried along by some annoying tour guide blabbing away.  And, there were plenty of benches for my pathetic ass to stop and rest for a minute.  It had been a rough night."
1,"we had the best meal in a long time here last night! Excellent fast service! we waited less than 10 minutes for our food, the food was AMAZING! steak was so delicious, garlic fries were sooooo gooood! and the brownie dessert was the perfect end to a wonderful meal. (sigh) I think im in love... :D"
1,"This is my favorite coffee shop. I go here EVERY Wednesday after stopping at the Town & Country farmer's market, and lately I've been convincing the parents to join me for brunch after church on Sundays. Guess you could say I'm a regular.\n\nI always order the same drink because it's just so good - iced almond milk mocha. Sometimes I'll get a little crazy and add some caramel. Watch out. \n\nEverything I've eaten there has been fantastic (and I've eaten a lot). If you've been to Paris and you are aching for a croissant, but those huge undercooked limp things in the Starbucks refrigerator case just aren't doing it for you - you have to have one at Carmel's. Perfection.\n\nMake sure to go out back and enjoy your latte or crepes. They made the best out of that little area. \n\nPat, the owner, is awesome. I love chatting with him about old music. One day I came in and he was snacking on a fresh orange behind the counter - he randomly just stuck out the plate to me. I remember that just putting a huge smile on my face.\n\nLittle things go a long way....and Carmel's is full of them."
0,"I had both my sons through doctors here. Neither births were positive experiences although my sons are happy and healthy. Pediatricians upstairs are grand. Obgyn, not so much."
1,"The Butterfield's brothers have done it again! Butters is everything I look for in a breakfast or lunch spot. It's open and airy, the staff is friendly and fast and the food is fantastic. Oh and did I mention that the patio is dog-friendly? All pluses in my book! Since so many of the reviews are about breakfast, I am going to talk about lunch!\n\nTheir wraps are amazing. The tortilla bread is soft and fresh and the combinations are mouthwatering. I ordered the Southwest Veggie Wrap with the addition of turkey. The wrap has Black beans, jalape\u00f1o cheese, corn, red bell pepper, avocado, scallion, lettuce, tomato & chipotle mayo. Every bite is better then the one before it. For my side, I splurged and ordered the sweet potato fries. Oh sweet happiness, I am so glad I did! The lunch was heartier than I typically opt for in the middle of the day, but when the food is this good, it doesn't quiet matter as much! \n\nThe server was friendly and efficient. In fact, I had only had 1/3 of my Diet Coke and she brought me out a new one! That's service. This is definitely a eatery that shouldn't be missed."
1,4 stars for the atmosphere. There are not many places in Pittsburgh to dine along the water and the outdoor seating at Redfin Blues is fantastic-huge outdoor deck with lots of tables under umbrellas. It was the perfect venture for Sunday Funday and I don't know why I have never been here before-well it is pretty hidden. They have a large parking lot and the outdoor seating was seat yourself.  It wasn't crowded so the service was fine but I could see on a busy Friday or Saturday the service would be less than stellar. We drank a beer (they only have bottled beers) and sat by the river to watch the boats go by.  The beers are pricy as our Curious Traveler Shandy was $6.50 each but it was a perfect drink for a hot day!  The menu is mostly seafood and pricey-the buffalo shrip where you only get 5 was $11.  It was only 3pm so we went with an appetizer of cheese fries with bacon and ranch-delicious and how could you go wrong! The fries had a tasty seasoning on them.
1,"5 STARS! A place so good the only bad thing is the $50+ per person check that comes afterwards. Luckily, I got it all free. While waiting for a table we got a top quality Cazadores Reposadas (sp?) tequila on the rocks. It was really strong, and really high-quality. In fact - i've never tasted a tequila like it. Other than Chili's presidente margarita I've never had a higher quality one.\n\nFor appetizor we got the Seafood Maya Relleno - a melted cheese and seafood dish which had real ceviche, rock shrimp, and amazing scallops with some sort of cheddary, spicy cheese on top melted to perfection. 5/5 delicious!!\n\nFor the entrees I ordered the grilled adobo marinated mango salmon over pollento. The salmon was so tender and juicy it melted in my mouth. I was eating tiny little chunks just to savor it all. The pollenta and the sauce it came with was amazing as well 5/5.\n\nMy friend got the chicken enchiladas (I tried to tell her to try something unique like my dish [a top entree], but she insisted on her fav enchiladas, and they were very good - though just enchiladas 4/5. I wish she had gotten something else off the entree menu so that I could try some ha.\n\nFor dessert we shared one of the better flans I've ever tasted. The caramel glaze and design of it were extraordinary. 5/5 Flan!\n\nWashing it down with a reposada refill made it all the better.\n\nA true culinary experience. $120 total bill post tip. Thankfully it was my early bday gift!"
1,"A really good local coffee shop in Surprise.  Amoungst all of our corporate coffee shops this place is a hidden gem.  They have live music, local artwork on display, and great coffee.\n\nDo yourself a favor and try it!"
0,"The 2 previous reviews want you to believe this is the best mexican party place around.\n\nI must have missed the party because at 12 noon it was completely DEAD-no lunch crowd.\n\nAnd they failed to mention this is in the Commercial Center plaza. A very scary place to go let alone eat.\n\nWell the place is huge seating for 100+ people and a large stage plus private boothes.\n\nThe chips are hard & flavorless and the salsa too tomatoey and no spice at all. NO BEANS either.\n\nThe prices were very moderate and the portions were fair but nothing really special.\n\nI ordered the Carne Asada plate for $10-the carne asada was nice & tender but it was not charbroiled as the description on the menu claimed.\n\nThe pico was weak and the jalapeno had no spice at all.\n\nMY wife had a carne asada taco which was pretty large and also a cheese enchilada which was the highlight of the entire meal.\n\nI was disappointed with the cleanliness of the place since there was NO crowd and it was also pretty lackluster food, NOT spicy at all.\n\nThank goodness I had a restaurant.com coupon for $10 OFF."
1,Tried this place while waiting for my iPhone to get fixed. Holy moly! Awesome food! We had the lobster bisque and calamari and I can definitely say that it was one of the best lunches I have had in a long time! We will be back!
0,"We went to this restaurant for thanksgiving dinner. Our service was extremely poor, the waiter was a klutz. He dropped my friend's drink, made us repeat our order and was constantly interrupting our conversation. I dont think that the food was extraordinary either. We spent close to 1000 USD and felt extremely disappointed. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. In a place like Vegas, I would recommend to spend your money elsewhere."
1,"As a brunch aficionado, I must say Lazy Jane's ranks up there on the Madison circuit.  Scone selection was amazing, and really, all the baked goods looked delicious.  I had the veggie frittata which was quite yummy and the Columbian Italian coffee was on point.  Slightly weird that they served it in a pint glass...for a minute I thought I was having Guinness for breakfast.  Fiance indulged in the chorizo scramble special, which was also pretty tastey.  No wait at about 10am on a Saturday, which was surprising, though parking was kind of a  b-.  And I kind of liked how they sang my name!  Overall, good eats - I'll definitely be back!"
1,"This place is awesome!!!!!\n\nDon't forget to get your locals card if you live in Vegas, so you can get 2 for 1 drink specials all of the time.\n\nThey have good food, great servers, and awesome drinks......"

0,"Repeat performances at restaurants to me are just as important as first impressions.  After coming to a difficult conclusion on where to go Friday evening Super Bowl weekend in Vegas, we decided to revisit old school \""Pieros\"" which is previously reviewed here.   After enjoying the 3 piece jazz combo and singer in the front bar this absolutely packed to the gills with local's restaurant sat the 5 of us for dinner.  We were handled by Patrick who took our drink orders and Manolo who handled our food orders.  It appeared since we had some drinks at the bar and only a couple of us were drinking wine by the glass that they lost interest in us as not the big ticket table they wanted tonight. Strike 1!\n\nAfter the specials were presented 5 entrees were selected. All come with their house salad and potatoes & Vegetables.  2 Veal Parmigana's, 2 Veal de chef & 1 veal Saltamboca rounded out the list with 2  1/2 orders of pasta and a soup.    Let's start with the salad which was ok but nothing special to say the least.  We move to the $14.00 bowl of soup which was again nothing special and here the waiter never brings the missing salad for the 1 person who had an appetizer even though it was requested.  \n\nOn we go to the entrees the Veal Parm's were pretty good but sides of potatoes & Vegetables with Veal Parm UGH.  The Veal De Chef which was covered with a couple of roasted peppers and cheese was virtually tasteless as was the Saltamboca which was burnt prosciutto on top of thin veal saut\u00e9ed which was neither tender or very good.  The Sides were ice cold a mashed potatoes & grilled carrot & greens.  Both sides of pasta were POOR simple as that.  Let us also state that 45 minutes past from salad to Entr\u00e9e which was completely ridiculous.  PASS on deserts or coffee.\n\nNot quite sure what transpired in the 8 months since I've been here only to say that this traveler can find much better dining options in this great city than this place.  This one gets the Yellow X - Knock it down start over, it has outlived its usefulness."
0,"We went in on a Friday afternoon about 3:00 and sat at the bar.  Having a Groupon but reading the reviews here, we had very low expectations.  Place was quiet and we saw no dancing, etc.   \n\nHonestly, I felt CnC's wasn't as bad as what was written, but we only had one drink each and a plate of chicken nachos to the tune of $40. CnC's wouldn't allow us the two-for-one price at happy hour, and the nachos were large but very expensive for what you get.  Chips were drowned in the cheap cheese sauce and upset both our stomachs.  Meat was questionable and there was nothing but chips, cheese, and chicken.  Yes, the reviews about lacking flavor are accurate.  We got a tiny little plastic cup of jalepenos and another of diced tomatoes.  Bartender never came back to ask how everything was or if we needed anything, despite walking right by us dozens of times!  In her defense, she did take the $3 that our bill went over the Groupon price off our tab.\n\nWould we go back?  Definitely not, but we kind of knew that going in after reading all these reviews, but we were already stuck with the Groupon and hoping for better.  We'd bought the Groupon thinking we'd get the giant margaritas and souvineer CnC glasses, then learned there was a liner inside the glasses that halfed the ounces of beverage. No longer much of a deal, and then told not allowed at happy hour.  I'd be surprized if this place survives for another year unless they lower their prices and up the food quality.  No free chips and salsa in a Mexican restaurant (and very expensive Mexican restaurant at that) is just not right!!"
0,"Geee-ross!  The other half and I got take-out for this place.   But first a little back-story....  My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?\n\nA few weeks ago I convinced the better half to go pick up Gourmet House of Hong Kong, if I paid and he drove. Deal. Done.  I ordered on the phone - no problems. It's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  We queued up the DVD and we're ready to go.\n\nThe fried rice was yummy and OK.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.  \n\nI'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.  It was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.  I even threw-out the leftovers, which has only ever happened  one other time with Chinese take-out, when I left for vacation the next day and didn't want to stink up the fridge."
0,"I read the reviews and decided to take a chance. I was really hoping to find a decent cheesesteak. The delivery was within an appropriate time, but the food was still cold. My daughter ordered the loaded skins and they were definitely overcooked. Very dark and crispy around the edges. The cheesesteak, which was supposed to be thinly sliced ribeye, well it was just sad. They seriously should consider more meat or a smaller roll."
1,Unfortunately has closed it's doors. Bummer because I heard so much about the awesome taste and had a hankering for some cake. Maybe next time. The four stars I'm giving it are for those who've told me how good the cupcakes are.
1,"I don't know enough about the alteration business to give this place 5 stars since that comes with knowledge of the industry. But all I can say is my suit fits perfectly, was done on time, and cost about $90 for a complete revision! Had my pants and jacket taken in, and sleeves shortened and altered."
1,"I have to be honest, I never look forward to getting waxed, but at least when I do, I can enjoy the Lamar while I'm at it.  This place is great, it's exactly what a spa should be: clean, comfortable, and calming.  \n\nAll the staff are super friendly and good at what they do...Ellen in particular, I always leave happy and satisfied when I get a wax or facial from her.  \n\nThey frequently run specials too, which is nice, you just have to get on their mailing list.  If you're in the scottsdale area, be sure to book an appointment here."
1,"We ended up at this place when we tried to hit Over Easy at 11:45 on a Sunday morning and were told they were closed. Bummer! \n\nDidn't want to wait in line at Matt's and had been wanting to try this place for awhile. Took the trip down Camelback Rd. to The Breakfast Club. \n\nThe wait was pretty decent for a Sunday morning in the middle of old town Scottsdale. The host was friendly and helpful and seated us at a communal table with plenty of room between us and the other couple that was seated there.\n\nI started off with a cup of coffee and my girlfriend went with a glass of fresh pineapple juice. Our drinks came quickly. The coffee was pretty great at this place. Hit the spot nicely. My girlfriend's pineapple juice was perfectly chilled and crisp. \n\nShe came back to take our order. I went with the Mignon Benedict and my girlfriend went with the roasted turkey benedict. The food arrived pretty quickly, and my glass of coffee was refilled a few times in the meantime. Atmosphere was nice and relaxing, despite the expected ridiculousness of some of the people that hang out in Old Town. \n\nMy food was fantastic. The steak was still red in the center. At $13 for the sandwich, I wasn't expecting the quality of steak I got. My girlfriend's dish was actually even better than mine. Our waitress was fantastic. Definitely hitting this spot again."
0,"Good effort, but a fail in my mind.  It is definitely WAY too loud in there... if I can't have a conversation while yelling... not a spot for me.  Tried the dumplings, burgers and coconuts... and found the price to be fairly high for mediocre 'street' food.  I think the only thing I would be back for is to pick-up some Beard Papas cream puffs."
1,"My boyfriend and I were staying at a hotel about 5 minutes away from La Banquise. Everytime we walked past - day or night - a long line of people would be snaking it's way from the door and spilling out onto the street. An investigation was in order. We got in line and took the time to look around and find out what we could about the place. The answer? Poutine, poutine, poutine. When we were finally seated, a menu with an impossibly long list of poutine variations was set before us. We ordered the classic and pizza poutines along with some local beer. The food arrived quickly and our poutine fest began. Fries drenched in gravy and topped with melting cheese curds... yum. The pizza poutine (classic poutine + green pepper + mushrooms + pepperoni) was good although I think I liked the classic better. There is already a lot going on with poutine, adding to it is unnecessary if you ask me. All in all I really enjoyed our meal."
0,"My husband heard about this new restaurant so we went to check it out.  The food was mediocre, but the service was HORRIBLE.  I had a chicken quesadilla and the chicken didn't have any flavor to it.  My husband enjoyed his chimichanga and said the rice on the side was awesome.  Our waitress let my husband's water glass get emptied twice and waited a while to fill it (a different waitress even stepped in to fill it once).  The service was very slow, and what really topped off the 2 star rating for me was our waitress talked us into ordering a banana burrito for dessert.  When this mysterious burrito actually showed up it was actually quite good but it took 20 minutes!  And the whole time we were waiting, our waitress walked around and avoided eye contact with us.  At one point she stopped by and said they were plating it up right now.  10 minutes later the thing actually arrived at our table (not by our waitress, and not accompanied by silverware to eat it (our waitress had taken all of our silverware when she cleared the plates)).  The burrito itself was tasty but the ice cream it comes with is nothing short of bizarre.  I think the base of the ice cream was chocolate (hard to tell), but it had all this weird unidentifiable stuff in it and it was just weird.\n\nThe best part of the entire meal was the chips and salsa served before dinner.  Their chips are thick and crispy and good.  They have a very limited selection on their menu and I just wasn't impressed with my food enough to get over the lousy service.\n\nAs an added ammendment to this review, my husband spent the entire night after eating here throwing up and has been continuing to throw up today.  We will never eat here again."
1,"I usually get my eyebrows threaded on my visits to California but I couldn't wait for my next trip any more. I found a great deal on groupon, 3 eyebrow threading sessions for $11! This is a steal since usually their eyebrow threading is $8 per session. The lady who did my eyebrows and my friends was the owners niece. She was so sweet and she told us she was going through cosmetology school. Her service was EXCELLENT! Super kind and professional. She made my friend and I feel so comfortable. My eyebrows look awesome and my friend and I were in and out in under 20 mins or less. We went on Saturday around 11am (3/1/2014). The salon was clean and tidy. She shaped my eyebrows so good and didn't over pluck. I will definitely be returning!! I highly recommend this salon :)"
0,"Great idea, but fail execution.\n\nWell... I don't know about great, but it is certainly an interesting idea. Almost clever. \n\nGoing here was my friend's idea - it was either this or get that gastronomical abomination from KFC where they give you a bacon and cheese sandwich and then replace the bread with deep fat fried chicken. I don't like KFC, so I went with this. My choices might as well have been a kick in the face or a stomp on the nuts.\n\nI didn't know what to expect. We walk past the ambulance into the restaurant. The air was thick inside. Oily. I quickly notice that everyone is wearing hospital gowns while devouring their meals. If peopleofwalmart.com was a movie - this would be the cast. \n\nWe found ourselves seats and were greeted by a sweet young girl who put a hospital wristband on us and then came around to put on our gowns. The place is staffed with cute girls in nurse costumes. I look down at the menu and the choices are called bypass - the severity varied by how many slabs of meat they put on. It was all kind of fun at first.\n\nI ordered the lightest thing on the menu - a single 1/2 pound burger - also an order of fries (which are unlimited refills) and a water... outside of water, my choices are sugar drinks or beer. My friend ordered a Double Bypass which was a pound of meat, also fries and also beer. \n\nThe fries were cooked in lard - they didn't taste too bad, but were not crispy or special at all. They just weren't worth getting up for seconds. Soggy, floppy and flavorless... just something to deliver salt to my stomach.\n\nThe burger arrived in a paper tray looking like a sad heap of grease. The bun was glistening - soaked with grease. Butter? Lard? Motor oil? I couldn't be sure, but the first bite told me I didn't want a second. I peeled the top bun from the burger and plopped it in the tray. I attempted to take another bite or two, but couldn't take it. The meat was sub-par shitty, fatty grocery store beef. The cheese was cheap tasting as well. \n\nNot that I expected wine and caviar, but for food this cheap and shit tasting, I wouldn't expect to pay so much. \n\nI didn't eat more than a few bites of the burger and I didn't touch the fries much, but I still felt both full and hungry at the same time. I pretty much just ate a few pickle slices and drank a bottle of water. The waitress asked how I liked it - my friend loved it and said he would've had seconds. I said it was terrible and that I was dissatisfied. I didn't ask for any money off the bill and she didn't offer it either. \n\nEven though I didn't eat it, she charged me 12 bucks or whatever it was. I wasn't entitled to not having to pay or anything - I mean, I ordered it. I should've known what I was getting into. Still, many restaurants would've bent over backwards to make me happy. I can't really bust them down a star for this, but even if I could there's no option for negative stars. \n\nHeart Attack Grill served me one of the worst burgers I've ever had. The novelty of it wore off as soon as my food arrived. If you want to eat an unhealthy yet savory burger/fries meal - go to in'n'out burger.\n\nI will never eat here again. I like greasy food sometimes, but I would rather eat a stick of butter and wash it down with bacon grease. Seriously - fuck this place. \n\nThen again... my friend loved it, so you never know."
0,After getting an express car wash my windows were all scratched up. It was a long deep scratch in my passenger's window which was extremely noticeable. I was disappointed in the service because I thought it was going to be great due to the reviews. I think it was the cloth they used to wipe down my car afterwards that ruined my windows. There was a soap stain down the side of my car. Absolutely disappointing. They rushed the wiping of the car.
1,"Imagine a non-chain Cash Converters but without the accompanying skag heads and thieves and the Hogs Head is your store. Limiting itself to CDs and DVDs, the Hogs Head is a veritable treasure trove for music and movie enthusiasts. In the window you have some of their newer stock and a lot of boxsets, which are slightly misleading as to how cheap this place actually is. They are about \u00a315 upwards, but inside is where the bargains begin.\n\nAlthough loosely split into sections, this shop is basically a rummager's heaven. There are CDs and DVDs everywhere: on shelves, on the floor, in boxes. And although sometimes it gets a bit wearing looking through without really having any idea if you are getting closer to finding your chosen album, you can pick up some absolute gems without meaning to. With CDs and DVDs only costing a few quid each (a little more for the more recent ones) you can easily end up with a sizeable collection for less than \u00a320.\n\nI personally love these otch-potch shops and the owner is awesome as well. He has absolutely no idea what he has in stock but with the sheer amount of CDs and DVDs that is nigh on impossible. However he's always happy to give you a hand and together you rummage to find that ever elusive CD. I have never once come out of there with the album / film I went in for, but always end up with a few handfuls of stuff I had forgotten existed but then remembered I absolutely loved. A great place if you fancy challenging yourself to find the item you want, and even if you fail, you'll be happy with the other treasures found on the way."
0,"Since our visit a month ago, this restaurant has gone from extraordinary to ordinary.  The shrimp have gone in size from huge to tiny size.  The service was slow and it took forever to get our food.  The sauces are still wonderful but I don't think we will eat here again due to the portion size and the slow service.\n\nBy the way this  is Michoacan Gourmet Mexican Restaurant, not Lindo Michoacan, but a part of that chain.  The address above is correct but I noticed that many of the reviews are for Lindo Michoacan and not the one on Tropical Pky."
0,"What happened to this place? Over the span of a year or two, its gone downhill from one of the best priced and really well executed great buffets in town to one of the worst.\n \nThey just removed the discount for folks who don't gamble a lot, so now prices are $10 for breakfast, $14 for lunch and I think $21 or so for dinner. Still good prices compared to the on Strip properties but now much too high to be a deal.\n\nOn top of that, there has been a slow but noticeable decline in food quality and food offerings. From a rotating menu of delicious dishes equal to many of the better kitchens in town they have gone down in quality and now offering a processed nacho cheese stations. Instead of baked whole salmon on their carving station, they now have super fatty pork, and from gorgeous interesting salads they have changed to serving  iceberg wedges. Desserts are now inedible.\n\nWhen you combine the fact that they have increased prices, dramatically decreased quality of ingredients and taste of food, and now have eliminated the discount for having a Player's Card, I think it is well on its way to being one of worst buffets in town.\n\nWhen I visited on Saturday for lunch, the place was pretty empty and the food had been sitting out too long.\n\nIt's pretty clear that the management of the buffet has changed. The kitchen is no longer preparing as many interesting and usual and tasty dishes and replacing it little by little with the standard cafeteria quality pre=cooked crap of the worst buffets in town,\n\nSo although the service is still good, it can't make up for the awful combination of bad food at bad prices.\n\nStay away!!\n\nManagment: Please bring back the quality in your  kitchen staff and your food items."
0,"I seem to be the only person in the Valley that does not love this dog park. I liked it better before it was \""improved\"". There was more space for dogs to run and spread out. Now the park is carved up into smaller sections and very crowded. I have seen more dog fights here than in any dog park in the Valley.\n\nI think the real problem here is the people. The same people who illegally park their rented BMWs in handicapped spots at Fashion Square bring there pit bulls and accessory dogs here and are completely oblivious when they get aggressive/go to the bathroom. \n\nI actually saw a woman put her four year old in the park then go back to her car to get her dog. Of course all the other dogs surrounded the little guy, who was terrified. The woman had the nerve to come back to the park and yell at the people standing around for not watching her kid. (I was far enough away that she was back before I could walk across the park, but trust me, it was one of the 'What would you do?' scenarios) There also seem to be a lot of professional dog sitters who bring 5 or 6 dogs to the park and then \""pretend\"" not to notice when the dog squats.\n\nLong story short - in a pinch I'll go there if it's empty but I leave once the Ed Hardy crowd comes in."
1,"Being a member of the Edinburgh University Scandinavian Society, this Swedish cafe has been the venue for a couple of our events, and it's definitely appropriate, even down to it's decor of minimalist scandinavian design.\n\nI lived in Sweden for two years, so was increasingly surprised as I spotted one swedish speciality after another on the menu and at the counter! It's primarily a bakery, so all the delicious pastries and desserts I'd only found in Sweden were here, and in abundance as well; cinnamon buns and all sorts of muffins! They also sell a selection of sandwiches, and for those homesick Swedes, hand made crisp bread and jams imported from the land of the Vikings!\n\nOn the occasions I've been there for society get-togethers, there have been free for all waffles, served with ice cream, jam and cream... extremely messy but equally satisfying! And ofcourse a Swedish caf\u00e9 wouldn't be complete without an endless supply of coffee; seeing as I'm not particularly a fan, I'll give it a pass and say I've definitely had worse. \n\nPeter's yard is just off George Square, so a student favourite, and with outdoor seating, it's a glorious place to be when the Scottish weather decides to be generous!"
1,New Orleans in Charlotte? Good Cajun dishes. Lots of fried stuff. The flavor can get lost in the fryer. The all you can eat catfish is the deal. It can be made grill or fried. Fun place.
0,"Les clients de ce petit boui-boui juste en face de Cao Thang, pour la plupart des jeunes et des \u00e9tudiants, font la queue devant la porte pour attendre leur sandwich. Se peut-il qu'il soit si bon que \u00e7a ?\n\nEn un mot, non.\n\nEn fait, ils font la queue parce qu'il n'y a aucune place dans la boutique. Il y a peu ou pr\u00e8s un demi-m\u00e8tre entre le comptoir et le mur en face, ce qui fait qu'il est assez impossible de bouger, d'autant plus qu'il faut aller tout au fond pour passer la commande et ensuite revenir pour payer.\n\nLes prix sont corrects (de l'ordre de $3 pour un banh mi si je ne m'abuse pas) et les sandwichs sont faits sur commande. En revanche les ingr\u00e9dients sont horribles. Plut\u00f4t que du porc \u00e0 la vapeur, ils y mettent une sorte de charcuterie visqueux et \u00e9talent partout un beurre-mayonnaise \u00e0 l'ail qui \u00e9crase les autres go\u00fbts. Ils sont radins avec le reste ; je crois avoir compt\u00e9 quatre morceaux de carottes dans mon sandwich. Le pire de tous est le pain. Totalement dess\u00e9ch\u00e9, il part en miettes avec chaque bouch\u00e9e et on en perd autant qu'on en mange.\n\nUn d\u00e9sastre absolu. Crevez de faim plut\u00f4t que d'y aller."

0,"I traveled over to Circus Circus to meet up with a friend and checkout the casino.  When I say traveled I mean traveled.  We stayed at the Tropicana and even though we got on the  tram train thing we still had to walk, walk and walk some more before arriving at the Big Top. It looks pretty cool enough on the outside, I mean you have the shiny lights and the Vegas fixings.  \nWhen you walk through the doors things change up a bit.  I felt like I had walked into an indoor fair grounds. There were kids everywhere. I guess they are the product of what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  \nWe watched one on the Circus acts.  The act had a bunch of very bendable men pouncing around in leopard  print costumes.  The act was really good.  That was really about all I liked about the Big Top.  \nA visit to Circus Circus was enough for me.  I don't think I would want to actually stay.  It's so far from all the fun things in Las Vegas. When you leave Circus Circus  you feel dirty and you didn't even get to have fun getting dirty."
0,ONLY because one of my WORST dining experiences came from here.. DO you not rate higher.. BUT someone I adore.. adores the CJ.. I always find the service here so slow.. and Im not sure why.. I generally have been in the afternoon.. I do like the french onion soup.. but service... ITS alot about the service.. and every time Im here.. its horrendously slow.. HUGE desserts.. I mean like can serve a party of 3 for each.. get the berry cobbler.. my oh my
1,"I've heard from a lot of people that this place is pretty tasty-so I had to check it out. I thought maybe I had been there before and had an idea of what to expect but I walked in with a new picture in my mind. I thought it would be a sit down restaurant, but it was set up more like fast food and it was very fast indeed. I enjoyed a great red machaca burro and also tasted a flavorful bean, cheese and lettuce toastada and a side of Mexican rice. \n\nIt was pretty busy in there at lunch time and we lucked out getting the last available table for our party of 3. \n\nThe bathroom does not have a changing table and I had to change the baby on the counter top right behind the door-If you have small children that wears diapers I recommend changing them elsewhere. \n\nI would definitely go back here for some quick savory Mexican food on another day : )"
0,"The family wanted Korean BBQ so we we pulled into a vacant parking lot while I scoured through Yelp reviews for different options.  Korean Garden BBQ House was across the street so we decided to give it a try for sake of convenience, even though we knew the reviews weren't terribly favorable.  The BBQ is priced at all-you-can-eat but it's a single serving.  Bibimbap presentation was lovely but no one was overly impressed.  No one beats Cham Soot (Sot) Gol in Garden Grove, CA."
1,"I have an unabashed addiction to scoring insane deals on clothing, and Sunset Clothing Exchange is a complete enabler. I stopped in just this last weekend to do some spring shopping and was thrilled at the deals I found. Two French Connection dresses with the tags still on: $128 marked down to $35 each, and two tops and a BCBG skirt with the $78 store tags still on, marked down to $20. \n\nCertain brands make frequent appearances here, often times brand new. The owner tells me they have agreements with local boutiques who often have to purge excess or end-of-season garments. Brands include FCUK, Giani Bini, BCBG, Jessica Simpson, Sanctuary and Cynthia Vincent, among many other designers. The selection is much higher end than Buffalo Exchange (or, y'know, Goodwill), meaning that you have to do a lot less browsing to get to the good stuff. The kind folks at Sunset have done all that hard work for you!\n\nPerhaps my favorite aspect of Sunset is the apathetic attitude - at first glance, this may seem like I bad thing, but I, for one, am an avid shopper, and like to peruse the racks without being constantly pestered by sales people. The folks at Sunset leave you alone to do your purchasing in peace, but are forthcoming with friendly comments (\""Do you work out? Your legs are amazing!\"") and warm banter when you so engage them. \n\nI have been dropping in here for at least two years now, when I get tired of roaming the endless racks at Buffalo Exchange a few blocks down and need to find some cute duds quick. There's free parking out front, the store is never busy, the clothes are designer, the prices are reasonable and they've got some pretty kickass local art up on the walls. Plus, the owner let me shoot (and acted in) a scene for my movie there a few years ago. So how would I describe Sunset Clothing Exchange? I think \""chill as fuck\"" about does it."
1,"This place is great! I started in December and by March I felt and looked like a completely different person. The owners Ben and Sean are great to work with and really stress form and not hurting yourself. The staff is also extremely helpful and always push me to do my best. Not only is the workout amazing but the people are so supportive and friendly. From the second you walk in you feel like a part of the Crossfit family. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get in shape, or just wants to meet a great group of people. \n\nIf you do choose to join the Haboob I also recommend to try the Paleo Challenge. With 3 months of crossfit and paleo I managed to go from almost 200 lbs to 162 as of today. I don't think I could have done it without the help from such a dedicated team. \n\nWith a little hard work you can even have a better transformation than I did!\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/la4uI"
0,"Horrible horrible waiting time! The appointment was at 9:00. I waited for one hour and 20 minutes in the waiting area, which was a madhouse. I had to be taken into multiple rooms, 3 different waiting areas and I was there for almost 4 hours. The eye doctor was decent enough but the office is clearly overbooked. There were many unhappy patients complaining about the time wasted waiting."
0,"As a frequent live music goer, it really pains me to see venues wasted. There is absolutely nothing stopping Henry's from being a too music venue, but it's clearly unloved. \n\nMy biggest gripe is their sound system. Throughout the gig I was at last night there was a persistent high pitched electronic noise, and the balance was terrible. \n\nThe whole place has a really stink of can't be arsed. You'd think as a super central live music venue, they'd have loads of stuff on, especially given it was a Friday night Halloween. But me and my friends who'd come to see the band were the only ones there. They've done nothing to generate any customer loyalty. After my friends band a solo dj got up and dos his thing, to absolutely no one. All of this saddens me. If someone was willing to curate this place, and invest in getting it to a decent standard, I've no doubt it'd be heaving. \n\nThe bar is ok. The taps needed a clean, but the fridge selection wasn't awful."
0,"Where do I start.  \n\nThe burgers - All  were over cooked.\n\nThe fries - they were soggy.  We told the waitress that they weren't edible and sent them back.  She brought out a new order and they were just as bad as the first.\n\nWarm Jumbo Bacon Salad - It's listed under Starter on the menu and that's how we ordered it.  It came out after all the burgers and fries.  The bacon on the salad wasn't cooked.  It wasn't edible.\n\nChocolate Bread Pudding -  It was cold in the center.\n\nWe thought they had a great concept for a restaurant and we love burgers, so we were excited to eat there.  We will never go back."
1,Great selection of games in my opinion.
1,Loved it.   Food came out in a reasonable time.  Person taking orders was friendly and helpful for first time eating there.  Mac and Cheese Muffins  are fantastic.
1,Great restaurant - was surprised to find it so busy on a Tuesday night. I came around 7:30 and the dining room was full.  \nThe service was really good. The french onion soup was one of the best I've had. Did not taste like traditional french onion soup but had a great flavour and was not excessively salty like some soups are.  Also had the arugula / quinoa salad with striploin.  The salad was really great  with a light dressing and lots of toppings.
0,"Don't be fooled by the look of this place. We had better food and service at random local diner along the way of our drive from Texas. \n\nThe food was bad, especially the lamb burger that I ordered for lunch . The meat was too salty. The taste of lamb was non-existent. I would prefer to spend $16 for a fast-food McDonald's burger than eating that lamb burger again.\n\nMy wife ordered a BLT burger with salad on the side. Now why would you name it \""burger\"" without any meat? The meatiest thing I could see was the \""prepackaged\"" bacon which barely have any taste except, again, salt. And the salad... there were still dirt or spoiled leaves left. Totally unappealing. My wife lost her appetite after a single bite. We sat there waited and waited for over half an hour (not touching the food) for the waiter to show up (yeah right about good service) and guess who showed up!? The buzzer! Yup. And his job was just to clean up and fill up drinks. We then pointed at the spoiled salad and asked for the server. Yet no server came. Come to think of it, no one came to ask how we were doing with our meal the whole time we were eating there. \n\nSo, after the buzzer cleaned up the table, guess what, they dared to bring out the bill... without even asking if we wanted desert. Wow, my wife and I sat there in disbelief for a while. THEN the waiter appeared with 4 pieces of candies. Complimentary? Was that our desert? We would prefer a simple apology (which we never receive).\n\nTerrible place to eat. Period.\nJust come for the view.\n\nPro tip: You can get the \""better\"" view if you pay for the Eiffel Tower elevator ride, and a better meal if you bring along a to-go McDonald, and it definitely costs less than wasting time eating in this \""restaurant.\"""
0,I went with a friend yesterday and I had an overlooked hamburger (I was told it had to be cooked well done even though I asked to have it cooked medium-well).  The tator-tots were ok.  The I sweet iced tea tasted like water.  The dessert lugnuts (powdered sugar doughnut holes)  had a bad taste to them.  The only good part was they they were warm.\n\nThe manager was running around trying to help people but the food that we had was just not good at all.
1,"I was thinking about how I have been here in AZ for over a year now and looking back to some of my favorite places and events.   I had been to this park a number of times (I didn't have a job when I got here) but the highlight was the St. Patrick's day visit.  The fountain goes off (I think at noon) and it is green.   Now for those of you from Seattle or Oregon I am sure it is food grade, biodegradable, organic, wild, free range fish food and not a harmful chemical.  Either way it is kind of fascinating as are the people walking around.   I think FH really misses and opportunity here to have a food vendor or 2 to make this into more of an event, or maybe combine it with some Irish heritage festival.   The patio's of the local business are packed, so get there early if you want to sit down and eat lunch."
0,Terrible customer service.  They only care about making a buck. Did not address any of our issues.  Will not stay here again
0,"My husband, and I, often dine here on Friday or Saturday nights for their Prime Rib & Crab.  Last few times we came, there were knats flying near & on our food, the prime rib looked days old & it tasted that way too.  The buffet selection looked old & unappealing & usually my favorite part, the crab legs, were salty, like they were soaked for too long in water & salt.  The quality has really gone out the door, which explains why there are very little customers, plus the prices have gone up dramatically!!  Hope they read this, cause they need to improve in a major way!  I spoke to one of the managers regarding the prime rib, but the reaction was like he did not care!!  Never again!"
1,Had a lovely lunch with my friend. The Scallop roll is to die for! sushiwa is one of my favorite places to lunch in Newer henderson....it is so relaxing and the staff is friendly. The Sushi chefs are absolutely adorable!
0,"I have shopped at ULTA many times and usually have a decent experience. Not since moving to Henderson though. I use the ULTA rewards and back in California the points accumulate and you may use them towards anything in the store that your little heart desires. That is not the case here, you can only get certain items that you could purchase at target or walmart for cheaper than ULTA offers anyways. Also, the coupons that are frequently in my mailbox offering great savings do NOT work on any of the nice cosmetics I go there to buy, in fact you can't use the coupon on any thing \""high end\"" because they limit the \""Prestige cosmetics and skincare.\""  Its funny because the coupon says prestige then lists some brands but they mean all brands except what you can find at target and walmart as well as ULTA brand you are also not allowed to use the coupon on fragrances. The ULTAs in CA let you use the coupon on most makeup brands and fragrance among many other items in the store that the Henderson stores do not. I'm not really sure why there is such a difference, but my trips to ULTA are limited to what is actually on sale in the ad because the coupons are a joke and the staff is less than pleasant."
0,"I give them one star because of the staff. Everything else was well below par and dirty. The hotel is old, the carpets in the hallway were old dirty and loose to the point that you could easily trip on the walk to your room (even if you weren't out drinking). At check in the clerk told me all of the Go Rooms were sold out and she gave us a room with a nice view of the pools and wildlife area, she was nice and tried to help us out but there's only so much a place like this has to offer. The \""recently updated\"" room had a decent bed, but this is we're it stops. The bathroom were old and disgusting. Ceiling falling apart, old dirty looking tile, a 1/4\"" of dust on the shower vent cover. I complained to the front desk manager at check out and they gave me a 30$ food credit. I'm staying somewhere else next time."
0,"Called the Chandler PD about the sign spinner guy after getting nowhere talking to the manager us egg.  This sign spinner yells a traffic, drops his sign in the roadway, holds a sign out next to traffic over the roadway, etc.\n\nI will NEVER go to this place!!"
1,"The food and prices are amazing! The service was great, we had a group staying in the hotel next door and had about 30 person party roll in for brunch. They made everyone feel comfortable and welcomed. It didn't take long for the food to come out and I can't wait to eat here again.  This place is Canyon State Beard Club approved!"
0,"I got the philly cheese steak.  The bread was decent, but that was about all that was decent.   The steak was roast beef heated up.  The bell peppers were mushy and there was hardly any flavor to the sandwich.  I would much rather have gone to subway.  I would not go back again."
1,"There is nothing more frustrating then waiting and waiting for a table first thing in the morning, especially after a night that was heavy on the Patron.  However I'll wait all day at Zada Jane's downing some of the best coffee I've had in the area. Typical wait can be around 15-30 minutes for a Saturday or Sunday brunch.  Once you do get seated order biscuits while you go through the menu because everything is good and you may go through a serious debate on what to order.  If I can be of any assistance I'll just say that you cant go wrong with the Amaretto French Toast or the Bunny Rancheros."
1,"Best BBQ west of Texas. EVERYTHING TOP NOTCH AND DEELISH!!! My twin sister also agrees (maybe because we are twins). Really, good, you won't be disappointed!"
0,"I was not feeling overly energetic, so I wandered down to the food court of the casino to find something to take back to the room. I had not yet tried Earl of Sandwich so I gave it a try. The service started off poorly. I stood by the order area for some time before anyone even acknowledged I was there. After that they were reasonably friendly and helpful, but I almost walked away.\n\nOddly enough I did not order a sandwich. Instead I ordered the Baja Chicken Stuffed Potato. It comes with butter, sour cream, jalapenos and presumably chicken. I had asked for mine without the tomato that normally comes on it. My potato came out relatively quickly.\n\nThe potato had some good flavors. The jalapenos are a nice touch. The potato is good sized and filled me up. The issue with the potato was the complete lack of chicken. I am not sure there was any on it. I did not have it in me to go back down there to correct the issue.\n\nMy first experience here was lacking.  I will try Earl again, and will try a sandwich at that time."
1,"Ok so being a tourist in Vegas is often times hard because the draw is the craziness of the strip and everything it offers. Which is often times overpriced sub par food. We went to SkinnyFats tonight and absolutely loved it. Everyone was pleased by the end of the night and we may go back before we leave. The atmospheres is cool, the staff was super friendly and the food was ah inspiring. They have everything from breakfast foods to awesome dinner entrees and with 8 guests we tested them all. I am rarely this impressed."
1,"Pizza Brutta may be my favorite restaurant in the Monroe neighborhood, which is a mighty feat. They make excellent single serving pizzas, as well as very good & reasonably priced salads. This is because of their ingredients. They locally source nearly everything, from the meats, the veggies, the cheese, and even the beers, and it shows. It doesn't hurt that they also cook the pizzas Neapolitan style, so it makes the crust thin, crispy, and tasty enough to eat alone! My go to pizza there is the cremini, which is just flat out delectably savory with the fried onions, mushroom puree, and fried mushrooms. If you can take mushrooms, it's a real treat, and it ranks highly among my favorite madison pizzas. And don't forget to check in there on Yelp! They have a deal where you can get a free bread and oil."
0,"Impressive property, but do not play blackjack here!!   They just reduced the payout for a blackjack.  When you get a blackjack at the Venetian or Palazzo, they now only pay 6:5 instead of 3:2.\n\nSo if you bet $20 and get a blackjack, they will only pay you $24 instead of the customary $30.  It's a sucker's game.  They are hoping dumb gamblers won't care about the lower payout.   By lowering the payout for a blackjack, Venetian increases its advantage by 300%!!!  \n\nInstead, play blackjack at Aria, Bellagio, Wynn or Planet Hollywood.  Almost all their blackjack games are full pay.  \n\nDon't play 6:5 blackjack, it's for suckers.  Insist on the 3:2 payout."
1,"We originally found Joe's while vacationing in Anaheim and were SO HAPPY that they have one close to us in Tempe. The atmosphere of this place is AMAZING. I love how they are so patient while you decide from the infinite list of ever changing flavors, and let you sample everything you like! Service is amazing, and of course the product is one of a kind. Nothing compares!!!! We will definitely be visiting frequently."
0,"We went to Triple George to celebrate this Father's Day and a 40th birthday party. My friend suggested the Grill due to a previous visit and the fact that they are supposed to have great steaks. We made reservations for 8-mind you 8 steak hungry, very thirsty, ready to spend and have a good time 8! From our first order of drinks, two martinis had to be sent back after waiting 20 minutes. After ordering some more drinks we waited another 30 minutes for our drinks and all 4 of the martinis tasted different. We all ordered dirty martinis and we all taste tested that all were different. \nAfter waiting so very long for drinks, we ordered some appetizers. Mediocre presentation and already bad service, it was like our table had done something wrong we were not being attended to. You cannot share the calamari because it comes in a french fry scoop and the artichoke spinach dip was cold on the inside, and do not count on sharing the $13 seared Ahi because for that price you get 4 lil strips!\nSo now we have been here just a little over an hour and we are hungry. We ALL order steaks, due to my buddy's recommendation. Orders where placed and thank goodness we brought a bottle of wine because most of us could not finish our martinis and did not want to wait for another 30 minutes for a drink.\nAfter 25 minutes of placing our order, the waitress (whom we barely saw most of our experience) brought to our attention THEY ARE OUT OF STEAKS!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! It took 25 minutes to tell all 8 of us this!!! If we would have known we would have already been eating steak at a real grill!!!\nMy buddy was embarrassed, and we tried making light of it like ordering \""fish n chips\"" at a steak house. Basically our waitress said that they would give us smaller cuts and some of us due to Father's Day and the Birthday switched so that they can have what they wanted...ridiculous! The ONLY good service that we received was the gentleman serving us water and the gentleman clearing the plates. They even laughed with us as how bad this situation was.\nBy the time they brought us our smaller cuts and dinner we had been waiting since we ordered our dinner an hour! By now it seem that they are closing and we just want to get out of there. All of our steaks where fatty and nervy and most of us didn't even finish our meals. I feel sorry for the Dad's and our Birthday girl as this was a total waste of time and money.  \nThey maybe allot of changes on Freemont but if anything needs a change it is Triple George Grill!!! Way over priced, bad service, and they may be out of STEAKS...BEWARE!!!"
0,"Let's start positive, I called only a week in advance & the garcon easily accommodated our group.  The beer was excellent and appetizers were tasty (not to die for)!  And so ends that one star that really should be a half star if it was an option.  From the moment we asked questions, we did not receive the same warm welcome that others have yelped.  One of my nicest, most kind friend even wanted to leave well before the rest of us called it quits.  This whole review is about what happens when service sucks beyond all reason.  And worst off, they have to make sure we heard their reasoning with no sincere apology.  I was ready to drop serious F* bombs but did not want to be stereotyped that typical American.  But they sure portrayed themselves as the snobby, stereotypical Frenchies.  \n\nHOWEVER, I will say I had the absolute OPPOSITE experience at Au Pied De Cochon.  The manager recognized me from 2-3 yrs ago, warmly treated our large group in spite of the busy crowd and came around several times to ensure we were enjoying ourselves.  He also gave our table round of Irish Car Bombers; I jokingly complained I did not like that shot.  So he dragged me to the bar & we had couple of vodka shots!! Sooo if I can take 4 stars that I didn't give to  Petit MoulinA** & shoot it over to APDC, they well-deserve 10 stars!!!\n\n& to be sure the cool French folks can feel our pain, here's the rest of my review in French... Tip of the Day - Do not go here!! Plenty of other French-friendly staff at AUPD, Jardin Nelson, Deux Gamins!\n\nLe service \u00e9tait lent et absolument inexcusable! Que ce soit parce que nous \u00e9tions Am\u00e9ricains, les Asiatiques ou tout ce qui est sans raison d'\u00eatre trait\u00e9 comme nous l'avons fait. Nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 plus que poli, ne se f\u00e2chait jamais \u00e0 l'heure actuelle nous sommes arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 7:38 p (730p r\u00e9servations) jusqu'\u00e0 quand nous sommes partis \u00e0 09h27 p! La nourriture sentait bon que nous sommes sortis, mais le go\u00fbt dans nos bouches aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 horrible! Aucune des quatre personnes qui a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 nous a donn\u00e9 un v\u00e9ritable excuse. Le gestionnaire bl\u00e2m\u00e9 pour commander des appetizers avec nos entrees! Une jeune serveuse m'a regard\u00e9 et s'est \u00e9loign\u00e9 de notre table! Un autre serveur a dit qu'il a fait son travail et il sera toujours bien dormir. Je pense que comment peut-il dormir quand il perd son emploi parce que les clients arr\u00eatent de venir au restaurant?!\n\nAstuce du jour - Ne pas venir ici! Au lieu de visiter fran\u00e7aise personnel amical Au Pied de Cochon, Jardin Nelson, et Deux Gamins!"
1,"In Charlotte for a quick business trip, I found this gem on Yelp. My waitress Hanna seemed genuinely excited that this was my first time there and recommended several dishes, all of which didn't disappoint. Started with the BBQ shrimp, spicy yet tasty; sop the sauce with the bread. Next up, blackened pork tenderloin with fried plantains. 3 good sized medallions with an interesting bean chorizo sauce. The plaintains were battered with cornmeal and were very good. I also asked for a single filet of the salt and pepper catfish, which was very good also. Ended the meal with key lime pie. Overall the dining experience went well. I would come back next time in town to try other menu items."
1,"I am always so eager to eat and watch shows in Vegas so sometimes itineraries are a little too full and I end up trying to squeeze too many things into a time period. That happened with our reservation to Bouchon. I made a quick reservation for myself, my fiance and my brother to dine before our show and somehow, time escaped us and we had less than an hour to eat before we had to ski-daddle over to watch our show for the evening. MAJOR POINTS for the wait staff here because we told them we had to dine quickly to make it for our show and they rushed everything with the pace we needed and yet no sacrifice of friendly service. \n\nThe food itself is a good solid. It's not pretentious, simple foods done well. We indulged in 5 oz of foie gras as an appetizer (if you read my other reviews, you know I'm a sucker for liver), then I ordered the mussels, my brother had gnocchi and my fiance had steak -- and then I had a taste off everyone's plate. Mussels were delicious, flavorful though some pieces were a tad small for what we paid. The gnocchi is sooo heavy and thick but delicious - several bites and one would be full. The steak was also done very well so all in all, though the experience was too quick for me to really memorialize any one thing about the place, I would come here again and expect good food."
0,"Worst customer service. I have a iphone 5 that's been recalled because of the sleep/power button. \nI finished working across the street around 9:30 am so I figured I'd just come by and see if they would give me a new one quickly. \nI walk into the store. \nWalked over to the Genius Bar area and noticed a women working there with a red iPad. A guy that works there came up to me and asked what I was needing and I told him. He then said okay talk to the girl with the red iPad. She will take care of you. \n\nI was standing next to her when another customer, a woman walked in and walked right up to her. (She was assisting another customer). She told the customer to get in line behind her. \n\nOnce she was finished assisting the customer I walked a bit closer and she just ignored me and greeted the women who just walked in. \n\nMaybe because I wasn't directly behind the previous customer, in line?!???\n\nI just walked out. Such a shame, I don't have time during my day to schedule a appointment with the \""genius bar\"". I just need a new phone, mine is recalled. Pretty simple. \n\nBut fuck it. I just left. It felt pretty horrible to just be ignored like I was today."
1,"I came here with a groupon. The food was great and the service was excellent. The owner was very nice as well! Taxes and tips are calculated for you after the groupon, which is great! I would definitely come back!"
1,"We renewed our vows here yesterday, and it was a fantastic experience! The minister (a young brown-haired female) was sincere and genuine and very kind. We went at 4:30pm and didn't wait long at all. The staff was so kind and helpful. The price was also very reasonable ($60). When we got out of the chapel, there was quite a line. I read the other reviews about people complaining about the wait- this is the most famous wedding chapel in Vegas, you're probably going to wait. But it's super vintage and nostalgic of a legit Vegas chapel. Only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that the carpets need cleaned desperately. The chapel was kind of dirty."
1,"YES, the water fountain is a free show and it is still awesome.  But trying to find a good viewing spot iis tough at night in the summer, it gets way crowded.  The lobby with the glass Chihuly flowers in the ceiling is awesome and so is the Convervatory and Botanical gardens with the flowers/plants that change every season."
1,"Beso is located in Crystals shopping mall next to Aria. First of all, good service. We were seated promptly and immediately given the wine list and everything came out very quickly. Surprisingly quick. Beso ranges in the upper $20s to $50s for entrees so with tip and tax you'll be paying about $75 a person if you want drinks and sides.\n\nWe ordered the oyster shooters (they're not alcoholic) and there were very good. I preferred the tomato gazpacho oyster shooter. \n\nFor entrees we had both the tuna and the salmon. Both were wonderfully prepared and the portions were not small. You have to order sides separately, but they are very large sharing portions. The wild mushrooms side was $11 and way too large for two people to consume. \n\nSomehow we had room for dessert after seeing the dessert menu. The churros were simply amazing with a caramel sauce and creme. I still don't know how we managed to eat all six of them.\n\nThe bathroom is upstairs are requires taking an elevator and walking through the night club. There's an outside patio seating area as well as a dining room. The dining room is not too large and the booths are comfortable. Our table had a nice view of the Aria's fountain and even New York, New York's fake Empire State Building, so if I squinted just right I felt like I was back home eating at the W's Zylo Steakhouse."
1,"Fantastic crepes. Really. The savory ones (like the smoked salmon), the sweet ones, all of them are just plain great. The restaurant is actually a tiny basement of a Shadyside-style home. They try hard to make it feel like France by making it narrow, crowded, lacking air conditioning, and cash-only. Those are the drawbacks, but it adds to the authenticity I suppose. Also, they have Evian and Orangina, which is always nice. If you need breakfast - can't beat the crepes here. Go, eat, have fun, forget where you are for a while."
1,"This is a humble eatery, a pleasant surprise in the midst of a sordid neighborhood. The restaurant is choc-a-bloc on a weekend evening. So it is best to arrive around 7 pm, not later than that.\n\nAs indicated on their menu they start preparing the food only after the order is placed leading to a considerably long wait (45 mins to one hour). However, during the waiting period their customers have quite a few occupations like looking at the paraphernalia on the walls, sipping margaritas, devouring the crunchy tacos, listening to the loud Spanish music or looking at what other people are eating. \n\nWhatever their clients choose to do, there comes a time when the waiter places the hot plate on the table, they pick up the fork, take a mouthful and then there is calm in the din of Los Dos Molinos. In fact there is a near- Nirvana experience with every bite of the carnitas or enchiladas. \n\nAt the end the brusque manner of the waiting staff is forgotten, so is the long wait and restlessness."
1,"French Yumminess and an Adaptive Reuse Infill Location All in One\n\nWasn't expecting an option for French food in this area of town, but caught that French Grocery was down the road from my tailor.  It's more a deli/bakery/wine shop than true grocery store.  Still, you get the fix you're looking for.  \n\nTried two sandwich options and the garden salad from their cooler, along with a pear tart, one of each macaroon, a mousse cup, and a type of cake that looks like a big macaroon.  All were hits with my wife and daughters.  Especially the mousse cup for my ten month-old... but she would bite through mild steel with her new chipmunk teeth for access to anything remotely chocolate.  \n\nCheese selection was amazing.  Blast my Asian lactose sensitivity.  \n\nThe macaroons were best at room temp.  The big macaroon cake thing was excellent at room temp, but hard to cut because of the cream middle.  But chilled, it was easy to cut and stiff to eat.  So, recommend cutting while chilled and then eating when left to warm for 15 minutes.  Sandwich bread was a tad too hard.\n\nIf they had a true grocery selection for baking supplies, it would have been everything we were looking for.  And the shop is a beautiful conversion of what looks like an old garage or laundromat."
0,"Very disappointed, my girlfriend and I went into this place to try somewhere new, we were immediately met with a snotty attitude from our waiter (Ben). We were told in a very rude way, it wasn't happy hour after we were looking at the only thing on the table, the happy hour menu. Then when my girlfriend asked a question about which fish is in the seafood chowder, again we were met with the snotty answer \""seafood\"" and then a laugh at her question. Can't rate the food as we walked out. The bread and water wasn't bad though."
1,"Every time I come home to Scottsdale, I make sure at some point during my stay to stop in at China Lite and get a Sergeant Chang's Chicken to go. I have a deep love for this dish, it is reminiscent of General Tso's style chicken, but without the fatty, greasiness! There used to be a China Lite up on FLW right by my house, but it closed, so I drive down just to get this dish! I rarely eat in here, the decor is nothing exciting, rather bland in fact, but the food is always ready to take home within 10 minutes, and is super affordable. I also enjoy the Crab Puff appetizer here (Partan Cream Chease), and its been awhile but the Honey Crisp Chicken is also very good. If you come for lunch you can get these for even cheaper! All of the other entrees are made according to China Lite's \""healthy chinese\"" practices, without sacrificing flavor. I am friends with the family that owns the chain of these restaurants and am happy to give them my business! Gotta have my Sergeant Chang's! Yum!!"
1,"I have been going to a gym and working out on my own for years with mixed success. \n\nJoining Power in Motion has been a revelation for me. I have been going for six weeks. The first four weeks were a Foundations class, which lets you learn the exercise routines so you can easily participate in the classes.\n\nDuring Foundations, which is a one on one training I lost 5 pounds and two inches off my waist. The amount of strength and muscle I going was amazing.\n\nIt has been a great experience. I feel better than I have felt in a long time with improved flexibility and strength. What a great gym."
1,"It's a donut shop.  They have other stuff, too.  But basically it's a donut shop.  Brand new location.  I do my best not to eat donuts because they are soooo not good for me.  But if I'm going to have a donut, Bosa is the one.\n\nI've not tried the boba drinks nor their \""sandwiches\"".  My wife likes them.  I can't help but think of the scene from \""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World\"" where they have a burger with a donut bun.  :-)  But, no, they don't use donuts as buns here, so fret not!  All I can say is they do have my wife's seal of approval.\n\nAnyway...donuts, coffee and tea, boba drinks, and breakfast and lunch sandwiches.  This is what they do.  Their donuts are probably the best in town, or at least the best I've found so far.  You pay a bit more than grocery store donuts, but it's not that much more and these are MUCH better."

0,The flavors are boring.. nothing tasted like what it was supposed to and I don't like the fact that when you ask for a sample they fill it up for you and stand there when you try them.. it made me feel uncomfortable.
1,"This place is great! We thought that we were going back to the Afghan restaurant, but found out that it had changed to an Indian restaurant once we were already through the door. We decided to give it a try. The food was AMAZING! Really, really good northern and southern Indian food. We ordered the Palak Paneer, the Chole, and the okra (forget the name). Each dish was delicious! The Palak Paneer is normally a pretty bland dish, but it was surprisingly (and deliciously) spicy! The okra had a nice spice as well. I couldn't stop eating it! We also ordered one of the chaat appetizers. It was unlike anything that I've had before, which is always a great treat because I've had a lot of Indian food. I have only just recently discovered chaat dishes and I've never seen them in a sit down restaurant. Neat!\n\nWe were really happy that the curries came with plentiful rice AND naan bread (you usually have to order bread separately). The atmosphere of the restaurant is really pleasant and a little up-scale. The bathrooms are ehhh, but not awful. The owner came over afterwards to see how we liked the meal, which is always a nice touch. The server was a little new at the job and wasn't able to answer our questions fully. However, she looked like she had just started and needed more time to learn the ropes.\n\nOverall, a really wonderful surprise! One of the best Indian restaurants in Phoenix."
1,"Okay. What do you do when you're starved for a Fatburger when last time you were in Vegas, you were rushed off with no time to get one? Come back two weeks later and find the Fatburger closest to the Airport!\n\nThis one is usually crowded but I got lucky during 11pm arrival. What makes me give them an extra star above the normal three is that the cook suggested a new way to a favorite Fatburger staples: cheddar Fat Fries. Most awesome ever. How so? The cook melted cheddar at three different levels of my fries, not creating a cap, but actually soaking my fries in the greatness that which is cheddar. \n\nPlain medium fatburger with cheddar was perfect and my shake was great. Service was greatly appreciated."

Little kids everywhere anyway. \n\nThe GOOD was that tables were $5 and I saved $100 on my car insurance. \n\nI was also on the 17th floor, at the end of the hallway. And I get hit on by alot of prostitutes this trip for some reason. who knows."
0,"My husband and I were in Vegas for a wedding and I thought it would be great for him to get a really nice hair cut and a straight razor shave. When we made the appointment we asked specifically for Vinnie because of his great reviews and experience. The receptionist said he wasn't working on Friday but would be there on Saturday. The appointment was scheduled for 10:30. When we arrived the next day for the scheduled appointment the receptionist said Vinnie didn't work on Saturdays. My husband said it was ok to have someone else cut his hair and shave his beard. They told him to sit in the waiting room and they would be right with him. After about 20-30 minutes he went back to the counter and a manager said there was a mix up and they would be ready for him now but the shave would have to wait for another hour. He said that was fine and the manager said the haircut would be on the house. The haircut was great. The woman was very friendly and knew what she was doing. When that was done they had him wait for another person to be available for the shave. After he was done and paid for the shave (remember the hair cut was supposed to be free) he walked over to me. I took one look at his beard and notice right away, it was completely uneven! How could they charge so much for a shave and have it be so uneven?? The woman who shaved him also took off much more of his beard then he wanted. I took him back to the counter and said he needs to have his beard fixed. They said they were busy and he would need to come back this afternoon. I said we have a wedding to go to and couldn't come back. They were able to get him back into the room for the woman to fix it. She shaved even more off but made it mostly even. It still wasn't perfect. One side was straight and the other was curved but it was close enough and she obviously wasn't going to get it right. She was nice and apologized several times but that does't negate the fact that she didn't do her job correctly either time. Now to top this all off they wound up charging the full $110 on the card and refunded only $45!!! Before we left the receptionist apologized again for our experience and offered to refund the shave as well. Apparently they decided he should now pay for the haircut.  We are extremely disappointed in this salon and will never come back."
0,"I don't like this pizza no flavor compared to Napolis, verrazano, due forni, or Rocco's"
0,I just got an oil change 2 weeks ago I had to take it back because one of my lug nuts were missing and sounds like something on my brakes were loose. This is my 2nd time getting an oil change and I'm disappointed. My first oil change was done at the Sahara location with no problems. I will not be attending this service center anymore.
0,"While the staff is pretty friendly here, there is NO need to have a drive thru (with at least 15 cars blocking the parking lot) in a state that has 120 degree heat.  I'm pretty sure Arizona & Starbucks are doing their share to contribute to global warming."
1,great gym to go to and they are open 24 hours
1,Pizza with sausage and pepperoni was delicious as well as their Pinot Grigio. Perfect place to grab a bite when you have time before your fight.  Also I got my food pretty quick. *Note this restaurant is outside the security.
0,"Fries are good, that's about it.\nPlace is ALWAYS mobbed because it's the only eatery open in a concourse where two (!!!) red eye flights to PHL and Charlotte take off.\n\nFries and a Starbucks.  Yum."
1,"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner here while visiting Montreal. It is hidden away on a side street; an escape from the hubbub of St Denis. The food was gorgeous - delicious, beautiful, innovative and very inexpensive for what it is. The space is cozy and pretty with just a few tables. The chef is a true artist and the waiter struck the ideal balance between being unobtrusive and attentive. It's a real gem. My favorite meal in Montreal."
1,"Some of their prices may be high, but their grass-fed ground beef is a genuine bargain. It's $6.99 a pound there, whereas Giant Eagle charges over $10 a pound for the same thing."
1,Proud to support family owned restaurant.  I love riding my bike to the garden pizza and chilling out.  I do want a bar added to the  restaurant.  Overall tasty.
1,"Ahhh... Yes... Like the other gentleman, I will date myself... I too rem when Rob took over. I had the fun night of guest bartending with one of gf. :) Back then, there was a HUGE group of regulars. I could walk-in on any given night, even without $$ and a drink would be waiting for me as I made my rounds to say hello. Always a lot of fun. Timmy from Road Rules used to bartend there before he was on RR. And we used to bring the bands that played at Metropol (dating myself) back to Bar 11 for drinks, after the shows. From my memory, Rancid & Mighty Mighty Bosstones both drank there."
1,"This is definitely a solid place.  We had the chicken salad and the primo(?) - prosciutto, arugula, parmesan pizza.  The dressing for the salad was better balanced than most places which I definitely noticed (my tongue is very sensitive to acidic and salty food).  The pizza was tasty, though it had a bit too much ash and burn on it for my taste.  The pizza also had a tough time holding together for bites, smaller pieces of prosciutto should help.  \n\nThe free limoncello shots and powder sugar dusted fried dough were a nice touch to make this place stand out.  \n\nI think I like Cibo better, but this place is a solid second for this type of pizza."
1,"I've only had great times at the Lodge.  It's very versatile; you can have fun at happy hour (shooting darts, watching sports, playing pool, cornhole) and even better time at night.  The staff is great and do their best with such a packed house.  Very fairly priced and always has a pretty good crowd on the weekends.  The crowd is more laid-back than some of the surrounding clubs.\n\nThe bartenders are very nice too.  I've left my credit card there countless times (my fault) and they always keep it safe and of course laugh at me when I come in on Sunday to get it."
0,"This hotel is so outdated. so you know the saying \""you get what you pay for?\"" We'll that's definitely Hooters guidelines. \nWent with friends for a quick gateway and decided to go cheap on our rooms. Big mistake. Minutes after getting settled we had to request a new room. Bathroom sink was so backed up it smelt like a broken sewage pipe. *barf* \n\""sorry for the inconvenient but we're going to have to give you an evening shitty room\"".. Is basically what happened. \nAfter traveling for 4hours this was the last thing I wanted to deal with. \nNo refrigerators in rooms. That's an extra $25 p/n. AC is really loud and rattles. Old school tube television. My friend even got stuck in the elevator. Lol that was actually funny because she was totally buzzed and had a Final Destination moment. \nRUNDOWN hotel. For sure. \n24 hour pool hours but mainley occupied by kids. \nCustomer service: horrible! Staff at the front desk are extremely rude. In short: Don't do it!!!!!! If you have afford paying a few more dollars, do so!\nYOU HAVE BEEN WARNED"
0,"I called on Monday on the first of my 3 days off to see if I can get my oil pan gasket repaired like I'd been meaning to.  They said it would be about $250 and Wednesday morning would work if I'd drop it off in the morning when they open.  So I dropped it off at 715am and called around 2pm after I hadn't heard from them expecting my car to be done or close to done.  Turns out they hadn't even looked at my car yet.  Then they told me they had to fix the oil (?) sensor and wanted to do a blue dye diagnostic test.  I paid about 150 for that.\n\nAfter about 3k miles I went back and they told me what I had told them in the first place.  Its probably the oil pan gasket and its 250.  They also said it could be something else that cost 850.  I'd invested so much I decided to go for it.  Maybe they're just thorough right?\n\nSo a week later I went out of town for a few days and came back and sure enough, oil is still leaking out of my car.  So it must be an $850 repair thing.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit annoyed that they try to make you schedule an appointment every time, but they don't have the same respect for your time.  After that first time, the next one I asked them how long it would take (a couple hours) so I scheduled to come in first thing (7am).  When I asked them if it would be done by noon they wouldn't even promise me that at first!  That's 5 hrs for something that takes 2hrs according to them.  So for that I don't think they're the auto repair shop for me."
0,"Okay totally thought the burger concept was all about \""get and go\"" nope not here. My colleague got a hair cut from sports clip and when he arrived the food hadn't made it to the table. In fact, our original waiter only returned to our table for one refill. Now if the place was packed I would understand the wait but there were only 6 tables with guest and the table next to us, came after and got there food before us. In summation, this may have been a good restaurant if I would have read a review, researched the menu via the website and somehow took a guess that my waiters multi-tasking abilities would be the ban of my existence!"
0,"I've been here once before and thought it was fantastic. \nThis time we walked in and they pretty much told us we had to get the buffet, which I didn't even know was an option for dinner. We told her we had a Groupon and she said they'd still take it. I think we appeared disappointed, so she encouraged us to check out the buffet and gave us time to decide. The buffet had limited items but we were probably going to get Chicken Tikka Masala or Curry anyway and both were on the buffet. Our Groupon was set to expire in a week so we figured we better just use it. I think the owner sensed our hesitation and finally offered us the whole menu but she said it'd be a long wait for food nice they were getting busy. Only the booths were occupied so it didn't seem busy but we decided to stick with the buffet option, we were pretty hungry. She also moved us to a different booth, both of which seemed dirty, very confusing.\nWe were given a fresh basket of Naan and our drinks. And on to the buffet, I think the Chicken Curry was the best thing on the buffet but was pretty picked through and there wasn't much left. Tikka Masala was kind of bland, I make better at home. The Tandoori chicken was good but we kept getting little broken bits of bone in the meat around the whole bone. I didn't really like their dal either.\nThe entire time we were there workers kept walking back and forth with big sheets to set tables, aren't they closed after lunch to do this? We got there about 6 so there couldn't have been that many people in and out that quickly. The waitress/owner was very nice and apologetic throughout but the entire experience was strange. With all the good Indian options in town, I doubt I'll go back."
1,Pretty bomb! 2 slices and a large drink for 5 $ not bad. great pizza... check it out brahz
1,"Loving Toast!!!!\n\nLast few Sundays I have started coming here for brunch and its really great. Good selection of your typical breakfast options with some further variety thrown in.\n\nMost recently I went for the croque monsiuer which was deleciious, but having had the eggs benedict, the full breakfast and the pancakes on other visits on the food front so far nothing has disappointed.\n\nWhy the loss of a star, the service is erm varied. Some members of staff are lovely, charming and very efficient....others...welll....are not. Also its not a bif thing at all but they dont have fresh organge juice which I find very weird for a place totally geared up for brunch.\n\nAll in all its a great place but there is a little room for improvement! Still though, brunch at Toast comes JD Recommended!"
0,"I've eaten at Akahana 8-10 times. I love sushi and can't resist a bogo offer. But I've never been completely satisfied with the food. We've had the salt and pepper calamari on multiple occasions - sometimes delicious, sometimes over cooked and inedible. Food inconsistency is such a bummer. Most recently I called in an order for sushi take out. When picking up my order, I asked the attendant (whom I later found out was the manager) for some low sodium soy sauce. He seemed annoyed that I asked, grabbed a small, unmarked clear plastic container and handed it to me. Upon arriving home to enjoy my meal, I noticed an odd fishy smell about my food. Noooo! After a couple of bites of sushi I had to stop and toss it --- the rolls tasted like funky fish! I called Akahana and spoke with the manager who gave me the soy sauce, and while he offered to make some new sushi for me, I didn't take him up on it. I also didn't ask for a refund. I did however ask him to visit his kitchen and investigate why my two different sushi rolls shared the same fishy taste and smell. I suspected it was the rice or the nori, but who knows. I'm sad to say it because I love supporting Plaza Midwood businesses, but I will be taking a break from this spot for a while. I hope things improve."
0,"I was way too lazy and not up for going out to eat the Monday after Christmas so I decided to go online and order some Mamma Mia based on the reviews here on Yelp.\n\nI ordered the pizza, wings and soda special. The pizza was pepperoni with fresh basil on top and some hot wings with a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi. I also ordered 2 canolis. I completed my order at 6:15PM and was told, via email, that the food would be there at 6:55PM. Along comes 7:15PM and I'm wondering where the food is. 7:20 comes along and I hear a car. The delivery guy was sitting out in front of the house for about 5 minutes and I'm wondering....what the heck is up?\n\nHe comes up to the door and hands me a pizza with 2 bags of stuff on top. I see \""hot Wings\"" written on one and just figured the other bag was the canolis.\n\nI go inside for a second then thought...where is my soda? So I run out and tell the guy that I'm missing the Pepsi I ordered. He said he would come back after his other deliveries...ok, fair enough. I go inside and my friend had a salad out of one of the bags. I didn't order a salad! So I open the pizza and it's cold and just a plain pepperoni.  What the heck is going on???\n\nSo I called them and told them my whole order was incorrect with the exception of the wings.\n\nAbout 5 minutes to 8 the delivery guy was there with my Soda, canolis and a tiramasu to make up for the lack of basil, which they said they were out of. Then he asked for the salad back because it was someone elses he had to deliver. \n\nPizza, cold. Wings...not so hot...Canolis, too much stuffing and way the stuffing was way too thick, like frosting.\n\nAh well, I had better hopes....Maybe they were busy? I won't chance ordering from here again to find out though. That was a 40 dollar loss...made me sad."
0,I have to chime in after my first experience and reading the mixed reviews and agree with almost everything said.  The prime rib I ordered was very lacking both in actual temperature as well as flavor.  You may ask why I did not ask my server to have it warmed up and that comes from her lack of attentiveness to the table.  With that stated my girlfriend who is not a steak person absolutely loved her filet.  The french onion soup was the highlight of the meal.   With that stated about 10 minutes after leaving our downtown hotel we realized we forgot our leftovers.  We were just on the other side of the capital building and did not go back to retrieve them which means there is something to be said about the quality of the food.  I don't honestly see myself giving Tornado a second chance.
1,"I really like this libray.\n\nIn comparison to other libraries I have experienced, it has a pretty good selection of books on subjects I am interested in.\n\nThe staff is always helpful.\n\nI especially love that I can look for and hold books online - very nice!"
1,"Just got back from Church Brew Works, as we had a pretty good experience. There were probably 40 people in the restaurant, but the sprawling size of the place makes it seem empty with that size crowd. It's a really cool space, between the brewing equipment and church relics, so there's a lot to look at and discuss. There's even lots of helpful info about the history of the place and beer brewing in the menu.\n\nWe started with the \""Nontraditional Pierogies\"" (as opposed to the Traditional Pierogies) which change periodically; today they were stuffed with potato, chicken, andouille sausage, peppers, and pepper jack cheese (that I can remember) and DARN they were tasty, just needed a bit of salt though.\n\nWe also had fries with beer cheese. The fries themselves were okay, Potato Patch style but a little overdone. The beer cheese was pretty tasty as well.\n\nFor an entree we had the \""Cinco Formaggio\"" (a name I find quite odd, since cinco is Spanish and formaggio is Italian...but I digress). The combination of cheeses plus pine nuts is mild and yet very yummy, the pine nuts add a nice crunch. The crust is heavenly, though I wish it had a teensy bit more salt and perhaps some butter or olive oil to moisten it a bit.\n\nWe also, of course, tried a couple beers, which were good in my book but I'm not by any means a beer connoisseur, so I can't do much describing other than to say I liked it.\n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful -- checked on us enough times, refilled my water, all that good stuff. All in all we definitely enjoyed the meal and hope to come back for more soon!"
1,"Timely, very professional, and most importantly affordable!"
1,"What a wonderful boutique!  I was visiting AZ over the holiday break from Chicago and my Mom and I made an appointment. I couldn't imagine going dress shopping without my Mom and liked the idea of buying a dress from my hometown as the wedding is going to be in Chicago.  Uptown was my very first stop on my dress shopping journey and I came away with the best time and a magical experience. Sheila was incredible and so helpful.  The shop is so cute and I appreciate her time and patience in finding a beautiful dress for my day.  There were so many choices in the silhouette that I was going for.  Sadly, in the end I didn't end up purchasing from the store but the dress was an extremely close second in the running.  A definite must to check out the store, it was like a dream."
1,"Two words Henderson Special. It has wings, pizza and salad for a very reasonable price. The wings are crisp and juicy, the sauce perfectly seasoned. The pizza is greasy and flimsy. The salad crisp and fresh. This is my favorite place for date night. I wish they delivered, but every time I call the driver isn't working :-( Service is slow, but who cares, give me my wings and leave me alone. It's as close to perfection as any sports bar will ever get in my life."
1,Excellent food quality...tiny menu. The service here is mediocre but the food very authentic and delicious!
1,"Best ayce sushi I have found in Vegas bar none.\n\nUsually a wait to get in, with good reason. They have very skilled staff and the sushi appears to be super fresh. Always very clean as well.\n\nPrice is around 26.00 for dinner, great value."
0,"I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. From starting with the valet the second we got there, to the absolute WORST customer service from EVERY person we came across to the non working escalators/elevators and other non working amenities in our room. The worst was the most rude, unprofessional, ignorant, amateur staff I have ever had to deal with. \nHere is an abbreviated list of why I will never stay her again, from the second we pulled up, to the thankful second we left this appalling place...\n- Valet full when we pulled up so we had to park about a mile away(but not for timeshare owners) \n- Escalators not working when we first walked in to go up to check in\n- Room was so small (not a suite), it was a basic room with a king bed...pathetic.\n- Bathroom was tiny! Enough room for one person to be in front of the mirror...we had 4 people\n- An hour wait for luggage, after we already waited an hour and a half to check in. So we went all the way down to get some of our own luggage!\n- Rude luggage delivery(Denmark was his name), he was throwing our luggage on the floor in our room and banging into our walls and mirror while rushing into our room\n- Rude concierge (her name was Elizabeth) over the phone, she couldn't answer my question with a \""no\"" fast enough in regards to there being a Jamba Juice in the mall and after she placed me (not even asking politely for me to hold)she got back on the phone and said \""yeah, you have to leave our hotel for that, its two miles away from here, okay?\"". The lease professional concierge I have ever spoken to. \n- Concierge down stairs didn't know where breakfast was served??? We asked where breakfast would be and they said \""we don't have any place here that serves breakfast\"". After walking a few steps we saw a place with breakfast and enlightened the concierge on our way back.\n- Our toilet did not flush\n- Door did not shut all the way, had to pull hard to shut\n- Ice only on 5th and 50th floor!\n- Not all channels were working on the TV\n- Elevators not working, only two out of the four elevators were working at one time. We had to pass up three elevators stopping on our floor because they were too full of people. We thought about taking the stairs we were waiting for so long.  \nAfter reading a lot of other people reviews of this hotel, it seems the common problem is RUDE STAFF. It looks like everyone is having the same experience we had...a bad one. No one wants to stay there either. Too bad I didn't read all this before."
1,"This is the only supply store I go to...\n\nThe people that work here are so friendly and helpful!!\nOver the past 4 years, they have taught me a lot about what I was buying, such as best ways to remove Spirit Gum and how to take care of a wig.\n\nI always go in with extra time to look around, as they often have new items and exciting displays. \n\nAlso, on most of my stops in, I have ended up making a friend. There is always someone there browsing for props for a neat project. If there served coffee, this would be a meet up spot for all Vegas actors and performers.\n\nIf you are looking for costumes, make up, shoes or accessories, stop here first!\nNo store in town can match their levels of service and expertise for such reasonable prices."

I actually liked that they had burlesque dancers on display. \n\nI did not however like that they wanted to charge $18 dollars for 3 waters!!!

0,"Maybe I'm jaded after living in Phoenix for several years, but I was expecting more. This a place you eat at because you have time to kill before a flight, you are hungry, and you want something other than Wendy's. The beans suck, the rice is bland, and the tacos are overpriced. If you are in Phoenix on a layover, please don't judge the quality of Mexican food in the city from what they serve here. It's a shame too cause the staff here is pretty good. 1 star food, 1 star prices, 4 star staff."
0,"First off, I'd rate this course a 2.5 but there are no half ratings. I've played this course a few times over the past few years, and this last experience really compelled me to write this review.\n\nI arrived an hour and 15 minutes before my tee time, walked into the pro shop and the staff was friendly. I know this place AUTOMATICALLY tacks on a $3 charge for the GPS on the carts, but they NEVER ask you if you want it or not. Upon paying, I said that I would like a small bucket of range balls and did not need the GPS on the cart. Once I mentioned the GPS, I got a smug look, told my total and given my receipt. Friendly happy staff when I walked in, grumpy unwelcoming staff when I walked out. I was not directed where to go, nor where to pick up range balls. Lucky for me, I remembered where the range was...hidden at the end of the drive and around the back of the building.\n\nI hit my range balls and walked to the starter. Took him a good 30 seconds to at least acknowledge my presence. After which, he grabs my slip and says, \""We don't have a cart for you yet, and we won't until about 10 minutes before you tee off.\"" I was like, \""well F you buddy.\"" I kept my composure and practiced putting. Sure enough, when the carts came around the corner, it was time for us to tee off.\n\nI failed to mention, that this was a Monday and I was shocked at how many people were out there. The groups were paired properly and sent out on time. Once we got out there, we experienced wet conditions all around the front nine. This was a 2:16 tee time and it was still soggy. The greens were in good shape, but the fairways were OK at best and the rough was a joke...clumps of grass here and there, bare spots and mud. \n\nThe pace of play was WAAAAYYYY too slow. Each hole we were waiting around and started waiting for the group in front of us to tee off. On hole seven, we pulled up and there was one group driving off the tee, another group behind them waiting, and another group, and then us! My partner called to pro shop to ask if they could send someone out to see what was causing this backup and the response he got was just sarcasm and a \""what do you want me to do about it\"" attitude. VERY unprofessional! Of course, we never saw anyone check up on us. Later on the beverage cart girl even mentioned that the pace was slow.\n\nNot only was the pace of play slow, but the people who play here (and what seems like, regularly) and the most inconsiderate golfers I've ever dealt with. Pulling up behind you while you are on your back swing, then locking their brake on your downswing. Come on! Constant chit chat and yelling when they are 10-20 feet away from you on another hole, and then driving up and passing as you are swinging.\n\nWe nearly cleared the front 9 in 2hr45min. After that, it temporarily picked up but then came to a screeching halt again and sped up when people realized we were running out of daylight. We had to call it as we finished hole 16 and that was 4hrs and 15mins into our round. Drove up to the cart return and after we got out of the cart and was unloading, the kid asked up to pull forward more. He came up to me as I finished packing and was unstrapping my clubs and he was kind of reaching over me to wipe down my clubs.\n\nWhat a poor experience. I won't be going back here for a while."
0,I guess my palate just doesn't appreciate the coffee these guys serve up. For those of you you do like their stuff... Enjoy!
0,"I don't normally write reviews and if I do they are good, however I have to give a negative one to this place. They were great people but I don't like coming home and having to put bandages on my fingers after getting my nails done. I also had to wait quite a while after my appointment time to get start, which I understand because they only had three people working and had more clients than workers. Other than ripped up fingers and waiting they did pretty well.\n\nUpdate: My nails have already begun to fall apart and it has only been a week and a half. The top coat is almost completely gone. I will definitely never be returning to this place. I now I have to go pay more money to have these nails removed and replaced."
0,"this kashman's is closed - as of Sunday June 20, 2010\n\nTheir summit location is still OPEN - however, this is a little farewell to the Pinnacle Peak location.\n\nWhat used to be my favourite deli turned into a nasty neighbor. It's nothing personal, but really - they did everything to drive my business away, so when I say their doors closed, I was actually relieved because they left a sour taste in my mouth. While their food was decent, it was overpriced and I never got over just how cold and unwelcoming they were to not just me but everybody.\n\nI will not even bother to drive further north to visit their other location because really the farther away they are, the happier I am!"
1,"At the end of this review, I will share a tip on how to save 50% off your entrees.\n\nThe night before I was booked for The Range, I had the most horrible experience for dinner at another steakhouse so I was hoping (maybe praying) for a better experience.\n\nLocated on the third floor in Harrah's, you first approch an exclusive double elevator in the Casino where a hostess confirms your reservation and summons an elevator for you.\n\nWhen you step off into the foyer, you can see that Harrah's has spared no expense to make sure the cutomer knows they are in a fine dining restaurant.  Beautiful woods and tile throughout and floor to cieling windows surround this restaurant which is in a half-circle overlooking the Strip.\n\nBehind the glass elevators is a lounge with a piano player.  At the second hostess station, I was greeted by name and escorted to my table which was windowside.\n\nI sat down, and seconds later my waiter introduced homself (Chas, prnounced Chaz), gave me the menu and specials, and took my drink order.  A bread basket was immediately delivered with butter in a cup which had been piped through a pastry bag unlike the night before where I recieved butter in gold foil in the other fine dining place.\n\nI ordered French Onion soup ($8), a Caesar Salad ($8), and a NY Strip Bone-In ($42) for my entree.\n\nThe soup was delivered hot and served in a huge cored-out onion.  I thought the soup was absoltely delicious and was actually a Cream of French Onion which was quite unique, but I thought the portion could have been bigger.\n\nThe Caesar Salad dressing was absolutely one of the best I have ever had and anchovies were delivered on the salad as ordered.\n\nThe steak was absolutely cooked perfect and was butter soft.\n\nHaving had three perfect courses with such great service, I decided to try one of their desserts.  I am not a sweets person, but I had 3 choices from 12 on the menu.  I chose the Tiramisu, Cheescake, and Creme Brulee.  I asked the waiter of my 3 choices, which he recommended.  He suggested the Creme Brulee which was my first choice, but it was served as a trio--Raspberry, Chocolate, and Vanilla.  I asked if I could just get the vanilla and was told that many customers had that request, and the chef prepares larger portions of just vanilla, although that option was not on the menu, but available.\n\nFrom that point on, I have to say that the Creme Brulee was THE BEST I have ever tasted from Paris, New Orleans, Montreal or anywhere!\n\nThe meal, restaurant, and service were so impeccable, that I did something I have never done in 25 years of travelling---I repeated the restaurant a second time the next night with a different menu!\n\nNow for the good news.  If you stop at any of the 11 Tix4Tonight locations in Las Vegas, you can buy a coupon for 50% off an Entree for The Range for $3.00.  So for 2, you spend $6.00 up front for a savings of about $45 for a couple.  Be sure to make reservations in advance--even on a weeknight, and be sure to ask for a window table."
1,"Happy to have a Jersey Mikes in Surprise, AZ. Been here 4 times and the have never disappointed! This location is extremely busy   Yet, they are very good at working through the crowds."
1,"I asked my buddy where I could acquire a delicious dark beer last night, and immediately was told to get to the Yard House because they serve at least 100 different beers from all over the world. I had also never been here before, so there was no argument from me.. \n\nI saw the Chocolate Stout on the menu and BAM, my mind was made up. It was such a perfect decision too.. definitely recommend trying it. Being adventurous, I also had their Orange Blossom Cream Ale and a Lindeman's Framboise. Interesting combination I know, but YUM. \n\nOnto the food -  we started with the Grilled Korean BBQ beef, (boneless beef short ribs marinated in garlic, soy and brown sugar with jasmine rice, sesame spinach, carrots, bean sprouts and green onions) - very good, great flavor, nice portion, could even be ordered as your main course IMO. For my entree I had the Mushroom Lettuce Wraps, (stir fried, smoked tofu, pine nuts and green onions with three dipping sauces and shiitake & portabella mushrooms), also very good, and healthy!! My friend ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which had a mushroom sauce, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic mashed potatoes. Not my first choice, but it was very tasty and the mashed potatoes were so creamy, my mouth is watering thinking about them! For Dessert I had the Youngberry Chocolate which is Lindeman's Framboise & Young's chocolate Stout together (since both were delicious, I had to try them together, naturally). Prices ranged from reasonable to pretty expensive, the drinks were definitely in the very expensive range, as reflected in our well over $100 tab.. I will definitely be returning for happy hour one of these days for the lower drink prices. Service was great, bathrooms were super clean, all in all, I am a fan!!"
0,"No!!  Don't do it!  \n\nThis is my second review on this particular merchant.  They were previously located at 1455 W. Chandler Blvd Ste B-11 inside of the Bellagio Clinic.  They promised that the move to their own facility would enable them to provide better service.  Not at all...\n\nApparently, if you are a male and have an accent, certain staff does not wish to be pleasant or provide even the most basic customer service, let alone treatment.  Let's just say my husband has had a truly horrible experience with this place.  To the point of being prejudicial, but that is his story to tell...\n\nI've really tried to give this place a second chance after the last experience I had.  They swore up and down that that was not how they normally operate and that the move (another 10 miles out of my way, now totally 20 from my home) would only allow them to improve service as they would no longer be restriced by working in a physician's office.\n\nHere is what I know:\n\nIt's impossible to get scheduled within a reasonable amount of time.  They are either under staffed, overbooked or both.\n\nIt's impossible to speak to someone who is not a child.  Seriously, they all are just out of high school.  They can't answer simple questions and they are all sitting around texting or looking at Facebook on their cell phones.\n\nThere is never any management on site.  How is this even permitted by their corporate office?\n\nThe website says \""Our staff includes a certified esthetician, a registered nurse, a nurse practitioner, and a full time board certified medical doctor\"".  Not true.  No one is in the office except for the very young and unsupervised Laser Technicians.  \n\nYou cannot call them directly.  You must call the 800 number to ask questions about anything.  Even to ask driving directions when you cannot locate the new office and there is no signage to help you find the place.  \n\nThey have tip jars in the rooms.  Really?! Tip jars??!  Is this Starbucks?  This to me is completely tacky.  I have been in the service/hospitably/spa industry for over ten years and I have NEVER seen nor would even ever ALLOW a tip jar to be placed in a treatment room with a HUGE sign stating that tips are appreciated!  Of course they are - but don't make me uncomfortable and feel obligated to leave one - especially when the service is so very poor.\n\nTo submit a complaint, you must fill out a form online and wait for a call.  I did just that and received a call the next day from what I assume to be the location manager.  She left a voice mail.  I've been trying to call her back for three days.  It goes straight to voice mail.  I've left a voice mail but still no return call.\n\nOver it and getting all of my money back from Groupon..."
0,"I had the most horrible service possible! The drive thru person Brandon was so rude! After each item I ordered he asked \"" is that it\"" you never say that ask if my order is complete or suggest something. Then he didn't verify my order on screen. The total on screen showed 10.78 to pay I get to the window and was asked to pay 13.36?!!! I am pretty sure that is why you are supposed to verify the order! I didn't get a thank you or come again my food was shoved in my face and then he shut the window! I will not return to this jack because of this or any for that matter. Rude employees should be dealt with if I am a bother to you then find another job don't work in the industry that requires hospitality!"
1,Stage Dreams is a wonderful theater program for kids of all ages and experience.  My daughter has participated in the shows as well as the summer camp.  The shows are wonderful for the kids performing and the audience. Definitely a great program and can't wait for the next show.
0,"Crappy bar food. Greasy.\n\nDidn't know we were going to a strip club, though the service was friendly.\n\nWon't be back."
1,"Thanks for the heads up about this place.  I decided to check it out after reading several people who posted.  It's a simple place with pretty good food.  It was too hot to eat outside but they do have a nice patio with umbrellas.  I'll remember that when the Phoenix winters come around.  I ordered the roast beef with carmelized onion sandwich and I thought it was very good.  It came with a side dish.  I also had a coupon for 20% off which I downloaded and printed after clicking on their website from the Yelp review.  So, take advantage of that savings.  Thanks fellow Yelpers!"
1,"I'm really happy, though a bit surprised, to see that I\""m the first to review High Roller's. I really love this place! Fat Tony and his crew in the kitchen  haven't failed to impress me on any occasion. From chicken parmigiana to cannoli, everything I've had here has been great. \n\nGoing past the place, I know you might be a little skeptical. It's across the street from UNLeV, in the 2-story building that's housed such legendary Vegas institutions as (d)Espresso Roma and Tremorz. It's next to a tattoo parlor, and all the flame imagery and inked ruffians behind the counter might intimidate you for a minute, but be a man and step up to the counter - the guys actually couldn't be nicer. At first glance you might think that the prices are high, but I've never been dissatisfied with what I've paid after I was finished eating. The ingredients are all excellent (Polly-o Mozzarella, Hebrew National pastrami, etc), and everything is prepared as freshly as possible. That being said, all the work that they put into making everything right takes a bit of time, so come in for a leisurely lunch - or call & order ahead if you're in a rush. The place is still relatively unknown, so there's still always plenty of seating and not too much of a line - but get in there now, because it's sure to change. I sometimes stop in for lunch and bring stuff back to my office - all I ever hear is \""Wow, this is good! Where'd you get it from?!\""\n\nHigh Roller's also does catering, and Fat Tony loves the opportunity to let his true skills shine.  Even when he took care of a simple to-go order for some cannoli for me, the plating and presentation was something you'd expect from a high-end restaurant - not what you'd expect from a plastic to-go box!\n\nAnyway, I could go on & on, but you'd be better off just giving them a try for yourself. My faves are the chicken parmigiana, the Vic Vegas, and clearly the cannoli. Don't tell them I sent you, but you can always say that you're a friend of Neil's."
1,"Fabulous. Very busy and popular place. Why? Because the staff is friendly and the food is SO DELICIOUS! Check online for their 'secret menu' though everything I have tried so far has been well worth the drive across town for it. Don't let the \""healthy side\"" detour you, thinking only the \""happy side\"" will be tasty (why people think healthy = bland, I don't know!) - The healthy menu is very good. Some of my favorites are on it."
1,We were there for a company holiday party.  Our server was on the ball with everyone and courtese as well as assisting her regular tables.  The food was great and the entertainment was a blast.  The requests for songs moved quickly and there was a wide variety.  The employees seemed to enjoy their jobs and showed it by keeping everyone involved and the atmosphere in the packed facility moving and upbeat.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone
0,"For a NY Steak that cost $43 it had a surprising amount of gristle and fat on it, far too much for a steak of that price.   In fact I had to cut away half of what I was served just to get to the actual meat.   I was really unimpressed, a good cut of steak at an expensive restaurant should not be mostly gristle and fat!   Additionally I was less than impressed that the steaks did not include any sort of side whatsoever, and you have to pay extra for a side of potatoes.  The service was pretty good however, which is what is keeping me from giving this a rating of one."
0,Nope won't be returning.  Pulled up no one in the place.  Not a customer.  Not an employee.  Was it robbed?  Was everyone locked up?  Nope but they might have been partying in the back because they were creepy pleasant when they came out front to wait on me.  Ordered tuna but it could have been chicken cause it sure didn't have any flavor.  Very bland.  Looking forward to sour dough but the bread wasn't good either.  Manager you need to mystery dine.
1,The reverse happy hour is amazing! I love the food there and the drinks are also fantastic! Can't wait to go back for more drinks!
1,"My husband and I love good Indian curry.  In fact, most times we prefer to cook at home rather than going out.  Enter Dehli.  They have an awesome lunch buffet that has a lot of curries that are difficult to make at home.  Overall, go to this place for lunch and order the Garlic Naan"
1,"The best buffet ever, end of story! Went to the Bacchanal last night at Caesar's, it was great, but hey, no lobster!\n\n500 items and 9 kitchens seem like I would be happy, right? Again, no lobster!\n\nWhen it comes down to the perfect food, 9 people out of ten will say,  lobster (and the tenth has no taste!).\n\nThat being said, the Village seafood buffet has plenty of, yes, you guessed it, lobster! Tender, juicy, succulent lobster! If you want more lobster, all you have to do is get up and get some!\n\nI love the people who pick through and find the few they want to eat, too funny really. Its all you can eat. Take a shovel and pile it on your plate!\n\nMy plate refilled 5 times, it was amazing! \n\nStarted with Miso soup and crab as well. At the end, the lobster won!\n\nWhen I couldn't shove another lobster tail into my mouth I had to finally admit defeat. Damn!\n\nSo let's say I had ten, half tails per plate (conservative estimate). That would mean I had 25 slipper lobsters for dinner! Pretty amazing for free! Did I say free!?! Why yes,  I did!!! \n\nHere is how. Go to the time share presention and insist on this buffet as your gift! Three hours later this voucher will be in your hot little hands!\n\nMy tip, don't waste the crab, the shrimp or the fish, eat lobster!"
1,"This place was super busy and yet we got seated right away. I'm not going to lie I'm not a sushi person, but all of my family is so ya... They loved loved loved their sushi everyone that got a roll was so happy.\n\nI got the Chicken Yakisoba it was soooooo good! I was very happy with my dish. \n\nOur waitress was so cute, nice and very attentive. I loved the atmosphere of this place. The family absolutely found their favorite sushi place!"
1,Food is awesome. Wait is alright. But they really need a bigger place than what they have right now. But better to max there place out than to never sell much food in a bad location.
0,"Overall I had a good experience, except for the steak I had in the hotel restaurant. For the sake of convenience I ate in the hotel restaurant instead of going out. The restaurant presented itself as a higher class facility that should have excellent food. However that is not the case. I ordered a $39 Rib Eye that tasted like leather. I had asked for steak sauce because the steak had literally no flavour and was tough, even though I should have asked for a new steak. I had enough when I got to about the last \u00bc of the steak and asked to see a manager. When the manager arrived I had explained to him my situation and stated my $39 steak tasted more like an $8 steak. He then said the company would give me a $1 discount off the meal, which is nothing more than an insult. Additionally I brought this up to the front desk on checkout and still nothing else was done. Because of the lack of courtesy and appreciation of my business, I will never return to this hotel chain again."
1,"This is THE Dairy Queen in the Madison metro.  Notice how the Sun Prairie location has no reviews....because nobody goes there.  Anyway, they have a very strong selection of on hand ice cream cakes, if you are looking to pick up a surprise for your special lady on the way home from work.  They are generally pretty busy probably due to their south Fish Hatch location, so its not the FASTEST place on earth to get a cone if that's what you want.  They have all of the standard DQ delicacies.  The prices are standard.  I gave it four stars because I give a regular Brazier three, and this is the best one in the Madison area, as stated."
0,"I was coaxed to replace the parts I did one year ago, and they did not tell me that they made liquid leaking. However, they finally fixed the problem."
1,"I really enjoyed this downtown eatery.  We arrived fairly early on a sunday and did not have to wait too long for a table.  Seems to get pretty busy during the late morning and lunch hours.  It was surprisingly nice considering it was below some ghetto apartments.  Also, there was live music that day.  The shrimp and grits is a must!"
1,"Stopped in for the first time with the family in tow.  As we walked in we were promptly greeted.  I placed our order which consisted of 5 cheese burgers, 2 French fries with special sauce, 3 Mexican Cokes, & 4 chocolate shakes.  Our bill was approximately $61.  Our order was delivered to our table and everyone was impressed. The food was excellent!  As we walked out my daughters asked when we could return.  Can't wait to return & try the short rib tacos."
1,My go to place for something special. I can always find top quality produce or meats.
1,I park at Aaron's as often as possible. I only didn't give it 5 stars due to lack of space. They really should look into expanding.  Having that bouncer Lincoln does keep everyone in line so even though it's crowded no one gets out of control. I've met some really great people here. Will definitely keep coming back.
0,"This is one of the worst time share places  I have ever  stayed at.    It needs better regular maintenance and some updating might help i.e. spend money on bathroom, some new TV's and paint.  If you dont want to hang out there you are in trouble because nothing of note is within walking distance."
0,"My daughter's cheer team stayed here for one night because that was about all we could take. Our girls are 6, 7 and 8 years old. There were all kinds of creepy people hanging out around the hotel along with a package of sex toys that one of our coaches happen to get a photo of.  One of our dad's was approached by one of the bartenders letting him know if he needed sexual services that he would be sure to get it there at Rumor. My cheer team was promised we could practice in the courtyard, but there was dog poop all over the place so that wasn't possible. Our cheer practice ended up being moved to an inside room, but the ceilings were short so we were unable to do our stunts. One of our moms had absolutely no hot water in her room to take a shower. the room I had was very dusty, missing a living room lamp, the sofa had black stains on it and had no throw pillows on the beds. The room literally had to be cleaned while we were in it. \n\nOverall it was HOTEL HELL. Nice try, but I can never do it again."
0,"If you're used to acai bowls where the acai is semi-frozen and delicious, that's not what you're going to find here. Ours was really runny. Maybe we are biased having just returned from Hawaii where the acai bowls are nothing short of spectacular, but this was really disappointing."
1,"Usually we hit Mastro's Ocean Club when we're in Scottsdale, but we decided to change it up a bit and try Mastro's Steakhouse. It did not disappoint.  Our party of four enjoyed a family style dinner of Lobster Bisque soup, Chopped Salad, and a 48 ounce Double Cut Porterhouse.  For sides we chose a Lobster Mashed Potato and Creamed Corn. Everything was truly superior including the service. After dinner we headed into the lounge and enjoyed a nightcap while we listened to a talented duo of keyboards and vocals. Enjoyed the dining, the service, and the beautiful high end interior design of Mastro's Steakhouse!  Very pleased. Very impressed."
0,"The food is cheap, but not a lot of meat on the sandwich. The fries on top of the sandwich were cold but the coleslaw on the sandwich was great."
1,I was really impressed with this place the room was real nice. I Liked how the desk was aligned with the TV. The hotel is not too big so I do not have to walk 1/2 a mile when I want to go back to my room. The food in the CAFE Is good. I had the PRIME RIB. 6.99 or 5.99.\n\nI like the low limit Blackjack where I ran my profits up to 125. I sat down too long and left with a 25 dollar profit in my pocket. PARKING is limited and this hotel is in a part of town where TOURISM is bustling like it once was but CITY HALL is right next door. Definitely a place to check out for SPEND THRIFTS
0,"So I'm not usually one to fuss, pretty laid back so if something bothered me then well....bravo. This mcdonalds isn't in the greatest area, I can't fault the employees for that. I can expect that they get some shady characters and they sometimes you have to handle them a little bit more aggressively. Like tonight, customer causing a minor disturbance and was rude, and the girl which appeared to be a manager of some sort was behind the counter and got upset (naturally of course) she went and handled the customer. Waited for him to come out of the bathroom just waiting there while customers including myself were in line. Ok I get it, go handle the customer, go on with your bad self and handle the shituation. Yes I said shit-u-ation. I get it, go handle the stupid idiot. But when there's a line of customers waiting for service you would think you would get someone to cover you instead us waiting 5 minutes or ATLEAST a simple apology saying \""I'm sorry I'll be right with you\"" instead she was cursing and mumbling under her breath. OH and she proceeded to follow him outside, let it go! He left! So another employee finally started taking orders only after telling me she was already clocked out! Unprofessional. Like come on handle the idiot but don't act like one. Rant over. Oh....and my fries are good."
0,Was wanting one of those humongous margarita's everyone was walking around town with.  I got a pina colada flavor and the whole thing was a giant slushy. No alcohol taste whatsoever. I guess I paid the price for falling into the the tourist trap type drinks. Not doing that again.
1,"STA Travel was my automatic go to place for travel advice when I decided to go on a trip to South America a while ago. I think this was partly because I'd been bombarded with STA Travel banter while I was at university, with it being a travel agent specialising in youth and student travel and all that jazz. The idea of a round the world ticket has been my prospective get out of being an adult option for ages, and I am not lying when I say that I think about walking into STA Travel and just booking said ticket and leaving a farewell note on the kitchen table, everytime I pass its doors.\n\nWhen I finally figure out how to save money, I'll be legging it straight down here for the golden ticket to recklessness and sunshine, but for now, a couple of trips abroad, for a few months at a time after I finished uni, have done the job. The staff at this branch of STA were super helpful at assisting me with both of these trips, and seeing as they're all pretty young, and have done a substantial amount of travelling themselves, it's quite an inspiring place to come and get advice from people you can relate to, if you're young that is. I have just edged out of the \""Youth\"" category, (*holds back the tears and the wrinkles*) but there are still some good flight deals and information to be had from the staff here, even if I am no longer classed as young."
1,First I have to say I have driven past Fanny's for as long as I can remember. Today I had to get some key's made for work and when I finished I was right next door so I finally went in after all this time. I was glad I did. The waitress was very nice and helpful went over the specialties on the menu and when I told her I would have to bring my daughter in to try their tuna she immediately brought me a sample to try. \nI got my order in less than 5 minutes! Amazing!!! I ordered the California Club it comes with a side of pasta salad or potato salad.  I got the pasta and I expected the regular old boring side the I usually toss out. Instead I got a wonderful fresh and delicious salad. The sandwich was very very good! This place was an unexpected gem!! I love it and will definitely come back with my family!
0,"I cannot say this clearly enough, DO NOT GO! We wasted $86 on this place. Took over 20 minutes to just get our chips and salsa. Chicken Fajitas and Pork Carnitas were bland and tasteless. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, I am a lightweight, I had almost 3 glasses and never felt a thing. My husband used to bartend and seriously doubted ANY tequila was in there, the overwhelming flavor was sweet and sour. No dissing the waitress as she attempted her best with no help from front door staff or bus staff. Yes it was a busy Saturday night but did they not expect that? C'mon already it's the strip! The only part that made us feel any better was the view of the Bellagio water show. Come sit at the bar overlooking it and have water!"
0,"I went here with a group of people, and I'm really glad that I wasn't the one footing the bill, because if I was, I would have been angry and disappointed. We came into the restaurant for lunch shortly after it opened, and our table was literally the only party in the entire restaurant. You would think that would give us a pretty good chance of getting good service, but no, the service was terrible. The waitstaff managed to mess up not one but two special requests, and it took over an hour to get our entrees. With appetizers, the meal was an hour and a half affair. One of my biggest complaints was the salsa-- it was EXTREMELY watered down. The Pace salsa that I buy at Costco is better quality than their salsa. The portions were small, and the food is not at all authentic Mexican cuisine. I guess it's some sort of fusion cuisine. Whatever it is, it's pretentious, and it falls flat."
0,"Big hype about Hakkasan! On the guestlist and in 'girls only' line on a Saturday nignt for 3 (!!!!) hours to finally get in... Club is mediocer, nothing special, not worth the wait or the hype... Ok ok Calvin Harris made up for it a bit, still would not recommend it."
0,"I don't remember when was the last time a restaurant has upset me so much that I have to give a one star rating, and I don't have a choice for 'no star'. Yes, Tien Wong made it happened, yikes...\n\nYou received the one star not because of the food, but the worst services I have ever received in this valley. We were excited to try this place on a Saturday night even we were told to wait for 45mins at the door, just too excited for some hot pot and the raves at yelp. Yes it was full when we arrived but we waited patiently until our turn. We ordered pretty quickly after a menu was given since we knew what we want and it's just a like a sushi menu, you check-mark the exact food you want. I admit that the food was good, presented nicely and freshly, and the broth were very good! However, everything went to downhill when the power started going off every 2 mins after we started eating for 10mins. Our hot pot dinner became a cold pot dinner with under cooked food.\n\nYes, the place was full, but the two largest family parties were already done eating and about to wrapped it up. Yet, our table and the one next to us who sat down around the same time as us, our power kept going off. It is okay for the first or the second time, but when it turned to the 3rd and 4th, we were like, WHAT THE HELL? This is a hot pot place where you rely solely on the stove to cook your food but they can't keep power on, how were we supposed to get the food cooked, eat raw?! The worse to come, as it seems that there were lack of servers, two different servers came by and said they will turn the power back on, which somehow the switch was in the woman's bathroom, so they had to wait when there was a customer inside...oddly enough, after the fifth turn of our power off, we called the server closest to us and needed an explanation, and she replied 'oh sorry, there is nothing we can do, when all the stoves are in using at the same time, the power just seems to be unstable'. EXCUSE ME? We are not blind, there were like 4 other tables eating right now, and you are telling me ALL the stoves are in using? And you cannot do anything? oh wow, this has just gave me the reason to not waste any more time at this place. Maybe you should check with SPR or APS to see if you owe them any money first! And the owner? Train your employees on how to handle such issue with a professional manner!?!?! \n\nAnd of course no one is in charge as the two other servers were just watching with no clue on what to do, we asked to bring our check and left very unhappy. \n\nYou thought the manager or someone in charge would show up when a customer is pissed, but no, it's like there is no one else. We didn't bother to call them either, what is point, get a 20% off of your bill? I came to eat, not a discount. If only the server was a bit more of professional and nicely offer to us another table and this night would still be good since we did like the food. But with this kind of customer service experience? I want nothing else. Tien Wong, you have failed miserably. \n\nA side note - as mentioned by a few other yelpers, I wouldn't say this is cheap at all, one plate of lamb for $6 and there were only 6 pieces, of course it's more of a pricy dish, but if you had eaten in LA for $20/person endless hotpot, you would think you just got ripped off...So be cautious on ordering."
0,"Came in to a really pretty shop and was greeted right away told the sales associate that I messed up the phone trying to replace the screen myself and without even looking the phone over said I would need a new lcd screen and it would be $220. I agreed to the price and was told to come back at 5, returned at 5 to find out the parts had not evwn come yet from some completely different sales associate and instead of them calling me ahead of time he asked me to come back at 6:30. As soon as I leave I got a call saying that the buttons need to be replaced to and that would be an extra $30 so they didn't initially assess all of the problems, they wasted my entire day and had me running back and forth to the store from my home, and then they raised the price after inconveniencing me when I could have had the full monetary assessment when I first walked into the store. This place has horrible customer service ridiculous prices and just overall sucks. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."
1,"Great stiff Tiki drinks, I cant wait to try everything. I had the Fink Bomb and it was strong and good. I came for Yelp Drinks and I will return. The Tiki chairs hurt my fat ass so I wish there were more booths. But a great hidden dive place that if it had more TV's I could come everyday."
1,"After 3 visits, this has become my favorite Indian buffet!!! I never eat alone, but today I craved this place so much, I made an exception. \n\nThe chicken tikka masala is perfect for those of us who love Indian but can't handle too much heat. The naan is delicious even if it is a little burnt.\n\nTotally deserving of 5 HUGE stars!"
1,"I found a therapist here at Desert Ridge location that is THE most intuitive therapist I've EVER found. I hope disclosing Alicia's name doesn't make her so busy I can't get in, but it's worth the risk. \n\nI've been a member of M.E. Since their first location opened years ago. Alicia is the best therapist I've ever had and I didn't review until I'd experienced her massages three times. She knows all the physical aspects, but her intuition is what sets her apart from any other therapist I've ever experienced. Each time I've been there, she tunes right into wherever it hurts and makes it vanish. She can make my body stretch and relax like I've never experienced, and I do get massages on a regular basis. I'm glad her schedule is late in the day, I can almost roll off the table and into bed (good thing it's a short drive home) and get the most restful night sleep ever."
1,"We stayed at The Trump in August 2011.  I don't even know where to begin with how much we loved this hotel!  We chose Trump because we have children and didn't want to be in a casino hotel.  This was far enough from the strip, but not too far.  It turned out to be the perfect location for us.\n\nEveryone at Trump was extremely friendly and accomodating.  From the moment we pulled up, until it was time for check-out we were greeted with professional, smiling staff.  The room was clean and comfortable.\n\nWe had birthday cookies and a pitcher of cold milk sent to our room for our daughter and they were big, warm, and DELICIOUS!\n\nThe bed was so comfortable I layed down and was instantly asleep.  I think that's the first time I've slept without tossing and turning in years!\nWhile the main bed was fantastic, the pull-out sofa bed was horrible.  That thing was super uncomfortable, even for the kids!  That's the only improvement they could make to the room and if you aren't using the sofa bed, you're going to love it there!"
1,I have been eating here for years. This is real Mexican food. Let me give you a couple of pointers...  Taqueria means Taco Stand. So order tacos!  They have had real soft corn tortilla tacos since they opened. I find it interesting that lots of restaurants are adding these to their menu now. I like the steak tacos they best. Tacos asada!\nAlso... They have margaritas now!
0,"Seriously, I am beyond shocked that this place gets the critical acclaim that it gets. My thoughts are it is because, to its credit, there is no competition in the city for this style of \""healthy\"" dining.  Part of the issue, I would guess is that people automatically assume that Vegan is \""healthy\"" when in reality, Vegan is only healthier than other food if it's prepared healthier than other food. Being a transplant and a foodie, with serious withdrawals for excellent, organic, sustainable dining found in other cities, I have returned to the Red Velvet Cafe numerous times hoping that it will be all that its followers build it up to be. \nI ordered a vegetable stir-fry with chicken, assuming it would be healthy chicken (I never eat meat out because I want to know where it came from etc...) Anyway, I trusted that this was a healthy, organic restaurant and when the order came the meat was prefab, injected, marinated, chicken with the fake little grill marks on it. The kind you buy in bulk from Smart and Final or Costco that is injected with fillers, sodium, and mystery flavoring. I was really shocked. Baked lays potato chips accompanied a friend's meal. I'm all for simple cooking but I feel that if you're going to tout yourself as healthy and organic then there is a standard to maintain or at the very least identify on the menu for people what is and isn't organic so they can make educated choices. I couldn't help feeling really duped by the whole experience. \n\nThat being said, the people who work there are for the most part really great. The guy who waited on our table was so sweet and funny. He made the whole experience really enjoyable, despite the crappy food. \nThe desserts, if you are into Vegan desserts, are amazing. Again, Vegan isn't necessarily healthier than other options so chocolate cake is chocolate cake, but they definitely did an amazing chocolate cake. \n\nCan't see myself returning to this restaurant any time soon and I would never recommend it to anyone, which I feel bad about because I know how hard it is to run a restaurant. The issue isn't even that the food wasn't that great, it's more that I feel like the presentation is dishonest...and that really bugs me! It's hard enough for people to try to eat right without being misled."
0,"This is the worst place to take your animal.  They had us wait for 3 hours and never did any thing for my dog.  They said they were busy with a dieing cat.  After 3 hours all they did was come in and ask if we wanted blood work and tests for $786.00.  My dog was having seizures, and the seizures had stopped, so we left and took him to my regular vet the next day.  They charged us $75.00 for doing nothing but let us sitting for 3 hours waiting for them to serve us.  I do not think we should have had to pay because they did nothing....be careful they are very unprofesssional....."
0,Disappointed in Starbucks today. My Venti quad caramel macchiato was horrible. \n\nI looked on the outside of the cup to see what They gave me and there was no white paper or writing on the cup. \n\nWhatever they made me wasn't what I ordered . I can't say they were busy at 0530 on a Sunday with me and one other car in the drive thru. \n\nDisappointing Starbucks. The staff at the drive thru was friendly that's why u have 2 stars.
0,"All I can say is, you can find better tasting breakfast food at the casino buffets in town and for a much cheaper price too!  Try Egg Works, or elsewhere.  Although the restaurant looks clean, the servers are not.   I've seen a server come back from smoking outside and straight to serving without even washing her hands.  Gross! \n\nThe restaurant offers a healthy diet breakfast menu, which is great. However, the taste is not there.  I would only return to this restaurant for three reasons, and these three reasons must be happening all at once:  when I'm too lazy to cook up my own healthy breakfast meal, when I'm too lazy to stand in line at the casinos for a meal, and when I'm too lazy to drive anywhere farther than a 5 mile radius from my home just to eat a damn breakfast or meal.  \n\nWhen I came in here, we were approached by a friendly manager.  The staff was okay, but seriously.....the food sucks, pricey for such a shitty meal (eggs from a carton box taste), and your server or cook could either be serving you good or bad that day (it just all depends).\n\nOverall, the Blueberry HIll located on 2855 N Green Valley Pkwy needs major improvements!  Hope this helps, or just see and try for yourself .  Good luck!"
0,"I've been to this restaurant multiple times, but after this last experience, I am never going back.\n\nI've eaten here once, ordered take out before and have always been pleased with the meal.  This last time I went, I took my mother and grandmother out to dinner.  We sat down, placed an appetizer order and then had to wait about 20 minutes to place our food order.  The waitstaff seemed frazzled with the amount of take out orders that they had and the few tables that were in the restaurant (there were about 4 tables including our own and maybe 3-4 servers along with a manager on duty).  Another 10-20 minutes after placing our food order the appetizers came.  Then we waited another 20-25 minutes for our food.  When we asked our waitress why the food was taking so long, she informed us that the \""kitchen was backed up with a lot of take out orders.\""  I'm sorry, but I have worked in the food service industry and I do believe that your customers who are actually eating IN the restaurant deserve to get their food before take-out orders.  After waiting quite a while to get our food, the waitress brought over my vegetarian squash curry.  I looked at it, and having gotten it before realized that it didn't look right.  I asked her if it was the vegetarian squash curry, and she said yes.  So I put the rice on my plate and put some of the curry on it only to find a piece of chicken.  I called her back over and she looked at the dish again only to this time realized that she had served me the Mango curry with chicken.  duh.  \n\nOverall, I was incredibly displeased with this whole experience.  We had to ask multiple times for water refills, the wrong food was delivered and the food came out of the kitchen incredibly slow.  Not going back."
0,"Mimi's is one of those restaurants that you want to like more.\n\nI say that because the execution is somewhat lacking.  We have been coming here, on and off, for five years now.  It's the coupons in the Sunday paper, or the email club that draw us in.  The pictures of the food look really good. But it's just, okay.  \n\nOne piece of advice for management would be to ease up on the salt.  Neither of us have sodium issues, but we would suspect that after coming here enough we would.  The gravy or sauce on our last visit was so bad, we were scrapping it off the food.\n\nAlso, time moves more slowing at Mimi's.  Maybe it's the lack of exterior windows, but it feels like I'm in a casino buffet room.  It's could also be the somewhat older crowd, who just sits, chats and just drinks coffee.   I do not believe it's the staff's fault, they seem to hustle around the place refilling drinks, etc. But, it would be hard to tell what time of day it is here.\n\nSorry!"
0,"food is good, but the people who work there are terrible. It looks all indie and cool inside- but once you meet the people they are every self-absorbed and rude. never going back"
0,Lost our stuff in the bag check .  They are incompetant
1,"So good! This was by far the best meal I had while at Vegas. \n\nMy friend's and I were doing Vegas as cheap as possibly. We decided that one night we would go to a nice restaurant for a decent meal. Can't spend all my money on alcohol and gambling. We randomly went with this place and I am glad we did. \n\nThere were three of us and we got two appetizer and two dishes to split and it was more than enough food. The waiter was really accommodating and helpful. He was also super nice. That is always a plus. \n\nIf you're in Vegas and looking for a nice meal, I definitely recommend Botero!"
1,"Love this place!  Amazing menu, great drinks, super friendly staff, great location and just all around great vibe to this place.  We'll definitely add this to our regular rotation...guess we're not the only ones though as this place gets pretty busy."
0,We stopped in on Saturday morning to give this place a shot. Walking in the door you cold tell this store was not ready for business. Secondly it's being managed by a 16 yr old and a group of teens who spent more ime answering their cell phones than taking customer orders. The espresso was terrible and it took them four tries to get four shots out of the machine. The breakfast panini was incorrectly made and had been overlooked. Don't waste your money here.
0,"Don't eat here except for breakfast. The morning staff is awesome. Manager Tobyn is awesome. However went to eat dinner there last night and ordered the prime rib rare. It came well done and was told they could do nothing about it.  Ended up ordering a different steak but took 20 minutes (first one took 10). Steak was on. Called over manger,  Tracy I believe, and explained or situation. She couldn't even look us in the eye. She grabbed the receipt and comp-ed the meal but said no apology or nothing. I thanked her for the comp meal but zero response. During this whole time there was another table on their third re-cooked meal. The manager dumped their complaint on the wait staff instead of taking care of the problem. \n\nAvails this place for anything but breakfast. The evening manager should be ashamed to be so indifferent to customers. The wait staff is very good but have to cost the terrible evening cooks and manager. Remember,  breakfast only at this place."
0,This place is on the summer bucket list. My husband and I were excited to take our son. The owner would not let our son enter the treasure digging area. This is pretty much why we came to the store in the first place. Owner was not the friendliest person in the world. Off day maybe? The store was incredible and there was a huge selection of great toys.  We would have purchased a few items had she let us go into the digging area. We went to target instead :/
1,"I love greek food so after a heavy night of drinking, a GYRO was the only thing on my mind. I went to the Fashion Show Mall with my boyfriend and headed straight for the food court and thought I died and went to heaven because there it was, a gyro spot! I briskly walk over and order my gyro, and it came out within 3 minutes! I also love eating my gyros with really spicy hot sauce and they had an awesome hot sauce there!! It was expensive, I think 8 or 9 bucks, which is the average when you're in Vegas so I'm not complaining. The night before I spent 15 bucks for a meal I did not enjoy at all so 9 was wonderful. They don't accept credit cards though, thank goodness I had cash otherwise I would have been a super unhappy camper. It's 2010, come on! Credit cards should be widely accepted, especially in Vegas! But other than that, tasty food."
1,We have eaten here three times and each time it is great! The fish tacos are outstanding. My hubby hates fish but loves them. Margaritas are spot on too! Family friendly to the max during the daytime.
1,amazing!!!
1,"Great for all the budding Andy Murrays out there , has numerous indoor and outdoor courts along with a gym which has fittness classes as well. Run by Edinburgh council so well run and reasonably priced."
1,"The pizza is awesome, the chicken fingers are meh.. Too small of an order to be satisfied, just FYI for all you fat bodies out there.  Waitresses are ALWAYS nice as can be and damn hot!  Every time I go there there's just hot waitresses everywhere and they're fast too.  Bartenders are great, quick.  All around decent little joint.."
0,"I went there today after not going since my kids graduated from school 2 years ago , I was shocked to learned they expanded. I thought that was GRRRRRRRRRRRREAT, until I noticed, there was no line at the door anymore or at least two people waiting for them to open, there was a INCREASE In their cost for Donuts. Well I said to myself I will try it. So I noticed the 8.99 per dozen I was going to get two then I thought I better get one .. As I got the one it came up to 9.72 I said what are you CHARGING to use your Credit card machine, she said no its Tax. WELL funny since when you start that.. I got the dough nuts home and they had a TUN of sugar coating, Icing, and grease on them. THIS IS NOT THE Dee's doughnuts I NEW. Wonder if the owners are new. BUT they wont see my business there again. NO THANKS. I went down the street to XYZZZZZZZ Donuts and got 14 for 8.99 vs Dees 12 for 899 plus 6 holes for 9.72 cents.. Hummmm, do the math :)lol.. No thanks Dee's , very disappointed."
0,"I'll preface this review by saying that it's based on only one visit.  I'd wait until my next visit to write a review, but I'm not rushing back, so it may be awhile.  \n\nI went on a date with my husband to Del Frisco's and came hungry and excited to try a new place.  The hostesses welcomed us warmly and the atmosphere is nice... almost so nice that I felt uncomfortable dressed casually as I usually do in this town.  Our server was friendly also.\n\nWe ordered a Caesar Salad (aka Knife & Fork Caesar) to share to start and I asked for some bread as well.  The bread never came.  The Caesar Salad was mediocre... You do indeed need a knife and fork to chop it up.  Next, we ordered the Prime New York Strip, the Creamed Spinach, and the Sweet Potato Fries. I'm typically a huge fan of all of these items elsewhere, but none of these were that impressive.  The fries were on the soggy side and the spinach lacked flavor, while the steak was way overseasoned.  We found prices on the high side as well.\n\nSo... while I may return to check out the upstairs patio, for drinks or happy hour appetizers, I'm not in a rush... I'm hoping their food may get better in due time as well."
1,Very great sandwiches esp. Since I'm Italian I'm picky on my meats but I love this deli
0,Do not get breakfast here. Maybe other meals ok.  Burnt toast & hashbrowns served cold.  People who think this is wonderful must eat at Denny's.
1,"Why is it so dang hard to find a great Chinese place???  Well, I am happy to say that we have finally found it.  It's located right next to the movie theater, and since we never see movies anymore, it took us a long time to stop in.  The next time I have a craving for lo mien noodles or orange chicken with a competitively priced brew, this is the place you will find me.  The service staff is very attentive and friendly.  The only small, minute thing that bugged me was the white butcher paper they lay on the tables.  It was cut so long that whenever I put my hands in my lap I got a paper cut!  Oops!"
1,"I stopped by this restaurant due to a co-worker's recommendation. It was surprisingly good.  I had the kale and quinoa salad with ribeye steak. The salad was very good (more kale than quinoa), and the thin steak was perfectly cooked medium rare.  \n\nFor an appetizer, I had a half order of the deviled eggs--a little dry, but otherwise tasted well. \n\nThe restaurant has either gelato or key lime pie for dessert.  I opted for the key lime pie and it was excellent. Surprisingly, it had a side scoop of strawberry gelato, which was very good and had bits of strawberries in it. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give it five stars is due to my server. I rarely saw him and had to ask other servers for drink refills and dessert.  The other tables didn't seem to have this problem \n\nI highly recommend this airport restaurant!"
1,"Incredible food and tea. I love their shepherds pie and any of their soups. Their spa tea is so comforting pr if you like black teas, get the black current - yum! They have delicious scones with amazing cream and jam. I just love this place. The decor makes you feel like you are in a quaint tea shop in England and if it raining out, you want to stay on this place for hours. The gals that serve you are always kind and allow you to take your time. This is a very special place to me and my mom. Enjoy!"
1,"i like stopping in here for a schooner or two...or three...it's near my house and they always seem to be open even though they are located in the mall......i am also obsessed with the kc fried chicken mac and cheese! believe me, it is nothing gourmet, but it is just good comfort food. people often bypass thismenu item because they are known for their sandwiches."
1,"A little disappointed that their price for prime rib went up, but hey, it's still only 12 bucks! And worth every bite. Tender, juicy, and I never can eat all of it, so makes great leftovers."
0,I can't see this place staying open much longer. It was dead at lunch and for $60 plus tip was so not worth it. I had a greet tea margarita ($14) and it was small and forgettable. My friend had dan dan Mein noodles while I had the shrimp crispy noodles. The service was great however nothing else was. My shrimp dish tasted ok... Definitely not worth $25 but after I got home I was immediately sick and have been for 5 hours now. Save yourself and stay away from this place.
1,"Culinary Dropout is real cool.\n\nI was in vegas for a bachelor party and had to head up 19 dudes and was looking for a chill place to dine and all I did was pull up opentable with the parameters of dinner at 8 pm for a party of 20. Culinary dropout fit the bill with nice open seating, patio area to lounge and even live music. I chose the perfect spot. Kudos to me and yelp of course.\n\nWe all arrived on time and were seated immediately. As I said there was live music being performed which was on point. Just as a word of warning I was slightly inebriated for most of the night, but not enough to lose my memory and make an accurate account for this review.\n\nFolks in my party were ordering beers on tap and other alky drinks. They came promptly and the drinkfest continued. Upon reading the reviews of this place beforehand the pretzels with fondue cheese were spoken highly of so the whole table got orders of that and it was bomb. I asked the waiter what he recommended on the menu and he pointed out that the most bang for buck dish was the fried chicken and that sold me. It was good but not mind blowing. There were three pieces; leg, thigh, and breast with a honey glazed biscuit, mashed potatoes and cole slaw. A massive dish indeed. Alky and greasy food go hand in hand.\n\nThe service was fantastic and the vibe and ambiance is well suited for big parties."
0,I went here for my friends bcz they were shooting pool so figured lets give it a shot... The bartender wasn't exactly friendly but not rude like I've know some bartenders to be. The food really did NOT impress me... We left more then half of it there and went toddel taco instead... But jukebox had good music n they have 2 pool tables so overall it wasn't the worst but far from the best
1,"Awesome place! Loved having a few glasses of wine and dessert! The staff is so friendly, great service.. The location is just too fabulous!! Perfect for a quiet dinner!!! Love it! Just come here!"
1,"Although immediately disadvantaged by having a Y chromosome, I still enjoyed this little boutique. Going along with my lady friend I could see the excitement in her eyes before we stepped through the doors upon seeing the love hearts outside. Offering clothes that are funky, hip and other adjectives from the 60s, there is a veritable feast of style in Trouv\u00e9 (as you'd expect from a shop with a 'quirky' French name hinting at thrift store chic) . With cheap t-shirts (around \u00a315-20), skirts and dresses, there is a surprising amount of choice in this small store, largely down to the fact it is very well laid out. Pride of place are the vintage dresses ( about \u00a375-100) and even as a guy I was impressed.\n\nIn addition to the clothes there are cool little nick nacks, jewellery and a good selection of shoes and bags, basically a girl's night out in one shop and who can say no to that. To add to this the staff are equally en vogue and have excellent product knowledge; it looks like they actually care about the stuff they are selling which makes a nice change.\n\nThe only downside is that it is so popular with ma petite amie that I am  not likely to stop hearing about it any time soon, which to be honest is not really the shop's fault. Vive la Trouv\u00e9!!"
1,"A friend of the bf who lives in Vegas brought us here to have the fried catfish spring roll. The fish was fried just right, was not overcooked and they they did pick the right size for our party of 6. There was even left over fish. We all thought that the fish looked a little small on the plate, but let me tell you, it was kind of deceiving. It was like a never ending fish. Al the veggies were fresh. The shrimp paste wrapped around the sugar cane was also very delicious. We also had the Bo Tai Chanh and it actually came with a very interesting sauce. Fish sauce with wasabi. I'm not a big of the burning in my nose, so I opted not to use the dipping sauce. Without the sauce the the Bo Tai Chanh was still very good. this restaurant also has the 7 beef serving, which i will definitely try next time. The service was attentive and they made sure we had enough wrappers for our spring rolls and that our glasses were filled. It's nice to find a Vietnamese restaurant that serves all these types of dishes. Usually you find one, but not the other. I think the drive is so worth it to have great food and will definitely come back here when I am in town."
1,Roti Canai and Khari Mee were really nice.  It took us a while to figure out what to order (so many choices that we were interetsed in) but everything that came out was great.
0,"I've been going to these guys for 7 years or so. Yes they have the cheapest oil changes around, which includes rotating tires. Look for their coupons. Now it seems they suggest work that doesn't need to be done. The latest is they said the rack and pinion needed to be replaced for $500. I brought my car to another shop which said they would love to charge me for replacing the rack and pinion but it doesn't need it, it's just an oil leak around the filter will be fixed with the oil change. This is at least the 2nd time Jack at Napa (the owner) suggested unnecessary work.  And Jeff doesn't work there anymore."
0,Extremely annoying! I called to see what time they where open till that day and they said midnight. (Even thow yelp said 2am but I called to make sure). My friend and I took a cab there exited to go because we've never been but have heard about it. We arrived at 11:20pm and they said they where closed....are you fucking kidding me? After I SPECIFICALLY called to make sure this wouldn't happen. They didn't seem to care that I was lied to and my trip over was a total waste of my time and money. Boooooo! To bad I didn't get the chance to try the food to rate otherwise :(
1,"I was having a staycation downtown for my birthday and like any time I'm hanging downtown I found myself hungry at 1am. I hadn't tried Du-Par's so we wandered in.\n\nFirst the interior is perfect. Nice red leather booths, long dark wood counter, great atmosphere. We were greeted and seated right away. The menu has a good variety of options. I chose the triple special which is a half sandwich, salad or soup and pie. At just $12.95 it was a good deal.  I had the BLT sandwich and everything was fresh, well cooked. The only reason I gave 4 stars was the salad was just average and the iceberg lettuce was a little brown. But the pie was excellent! I chose coconut cream and it was so rich and flavorful.\n\nThis is a great late night stop that I will return to."
0,"Hooray for the $4 slice!\n\nFor nyc-style standards, these can't be considered large slices.  They're medium at best.  \n\nYou have to be skeptical of most \""pizzerias\"" on the strip, especially if they're located inside a casino that was erected in the mid-90s.  Now I'm not saying that the place is old, I'm just saying not to put too much stock in a place found in a casino that's Caribbean-themed.\n\nFor what it's worth, the pizza has a decent flavor.  But it's short on size and long on price.\n\nAuthentic NYC-style should not be on your to-do list while in Vegas; drinking until you forget should be.\n\nThe irony is that I obviously didn't drink enough to forget about this place.\n\nMaybe next time..."
0,"It's the Piggy Mac that warranted two stars, they cheesy Lovers was just a mess. The Piggy Mac consisted of bbq pork with jalapenos and mac n cheese ($6). The potential was there, but the wheat bread choice was really poor. The Cheesy Lovers Delight with Bacon ($5) was not good on any level. Dry flimsy bread, congealed cheese and bland bacon. Yes, bland bacon. Seems like an oxymoron doesn't it?"
1,"I've heard great things about this place and live nearby, but am very loyal to my favorite sushi chef at another place... or I was. I've been avoiding him since I found this place, with an extensive menu, innovative rolls, and super-fresh fish!\n\nMenu has a lot to explore, and I love that the rolls aren't just your standard \""special\"" rolls on everyone else's menu in town. The cowboy roll with seared beef on top especially caught my attention. Mega bonus points for having SIX RICELESS ROLLS! SAY WHAT!? Unheard of, and they're almost all delicious. Freshmen Roll, Spring Mountain Roll, and Tuna Naruto are my favorites in this category. The handrolls and \""burritos\"" are huge and delicious- pick from the Monkey Roll or go classic with salmon skin. \n\nSide and appetizer dishes here are also pretty unique (ask for several of the mushroom ball), and the nigiri is thick-cut and delicious- appreciate how they use a proportionate amount of rice rather than gigantic mounds, as found elsewhere in town. \n\nAYCE lunch price (til 3PM) is a super-reasonable $21, dinner is open til 2AM and goes up to $27- adds extra dishes like uni and amaebi nigiri, grilled mackerel, sashimi or poke salad, and mochi for dessert. Bummed that the mochi isn't available at lunch price, wish they'd add some desserts as they are a bit lacking in this area."
1,"The have amazing food, vegeterian or vegans dream. Their mock chicken wings are delish! Definately will be there as much as possible."
1,"Every visit to Vegas must include this buffet. Lunch or dinner, expect to surprise yourself with 2 hours of gourmet food and drink. Our lunch included bottomless mimosa's which was a nice touch. Went a second time for dinner and was also very satisfied. Line can get long (1hr wait or so), so go during off-peak hours.\n\nBeware of requesting a small plate of crab legs though; they will ignore your request and pile on about 15-20 legs."
0,"I have heard so many good things about this place I had to try it. What a disappointment.\n\nLong lines. Expensive deserts. And the infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate was horrible. So not worth it. For 1/4 of the price, get a shake at In N Out instead. Way better.\n\nI do not get what the hype is all about. Not going back."
1,I really like the food here. But I also like the staff they're really attentive and everybody has a great attitude. I've only been here once so far but I know I will certainly be back.
0,"If you know exactly what you want and don't need to speak to anybody then MAYBE go here. I have been in twice and on both occasions left an armful of goods behind that I had selected because of my inability to get anybody to help me with other articles. The staff seem to go out of their way to avoid you. The place is totally understaffed. You have to beg for help and then get a nasty look for interrupting a conversation with another staff member. If you need help with Bike accessories - FORGET IT. They have a so called bike specialist who both times was not in and nobody else in the store knows a thing. The line I was given is that they are trying to find staff. Are you kidding me, in this recession you can't find good people!! The best was when asked upon leaving the last time if I found everything I was looking for and saying, \""No there was nobody to help me\"", the answer I got was \""Okay\"". They don't give a darn about customer service and don't deserve your business.  \n\nThe worst part is that seems to be a common theme if you look at the reviews for other stores. BTW both times I was one of only 2-3 customers in the store."
0,"I hate to give this place two stars but it is for the take out order.  We had a groupon and used it tonight.  Do Not get the Chinese Chicken Salad which is nothing like any of the area restaurants but rather is it soaked in hot and spicy soy sauce and only has iceberg lettuce and chicken and it is disgusting, we had to throw it away.  The Won Ton Soup was good, no salty and lots of wontons and pork.  We ordered the large size.  The brown rice has no taste and is boring, they charge extra for brown rice and do not have fried brown rice.  They also say they cook New York Chinese Style which actual is not true.  New York Chinese food has chop suey and chow mein, this place does not have either and is a disappointment.  So I had to get the Chicken and Veggies because I do not like the brown sauce and this is one of the few entrees with white sauce.  This entree is enough for two people, but they do not give you much with it, it is pretty much a la cart.  They gave us barely enough chips and only 2 fortune cookies even though we had more people. gosh could they spare it.  There other place on Hayden is much better food on take out then this place.  I was disappointed in the quality, quantity and taste of this take out food. It was nothing to write home about."
0,I visited their location in Arizona Mills Mall and the service was ridiculous. I stood in line for 5 minutes waiting for someone to even take my order then after that I stood in line another 10 minutes waiting to check out and pay for my food. Needless to say I became so annoyed and upset by the slowfulness they demonstrated with their customers that I happily gave them back their slice of pizza and told them that they could have it because I no longer wanted it. So if you desire to wait in line and then wait in line some more just to eat at what is suppose to be fast food then I suggest you visit this place. Sorry I couldn't give a review on the actual food since I didn't eat there.  I hope this was helpful to someone.
0,"STAY AWAY FROM HERE AS IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT (it may.)\n\nIn no particular order, the reasons why:\n\n1) The office staff/management doesn't know what they are doing (i.e. needed to be told what a 'copay' was, doesn't know what a 'deductible' is)\n\n2) Will make you wait well beyond your appt time\n\n3) The lobby stinks\n\n4) The Dr. has no bedside manner to speak of and she isn't up-to-date on her medical knowledge - she told me a condition I had should be \""cured\"" based on a medication I take for symptoms; the condition is NOT curable (I double- and triple-fact checked that just to make sure I wasn't posting misinformation here); she also assumed that I had something that made absolutely no sense (and terrified me), so I went for a second opinion two days later, and that (competent) Dr. said he had no idea why she would jump to such a conclusion - he pulled my labs and it was clear she didn't know what she was talking about because I had a completely clean bill of health (Thank God for that other Dr.)\n\n5) During blood draw, their phlebotomist went straight into the tissue in my arm and caused bleeding inside which put me out for a few days and left me with a huge disgusting bruise on my arm (like I'm a junkie or something; see my uploaded pics for proof.) If this has ever happened to you, then you know how painful it is. If it hasn't, you do NOT want to know how painful this is!\n\n6) They said to call Friday for results, then said they didn't have them (OK fine, it happens); then called Monday for the same results at 9 am and they said 'the nurse has left for the day, try tomorrow'; so unprofessional.\n\n7) Sitting in the room, you can hear staff outside in the halls laughing and basically wasting (your and any other patients') time.\n\n8) In the other rooms, I could hear other patients fighting like an episode of Jerry Springer - SO not the environment where you want to be getting medical treatment.\n\nThere are two other terrible reviews of this place that Yelp has hidden for some reason, but they are in line with my experience and apparently with that of the woman who was here in 2010.\n\n*****Do not go here - you've been warned.****"
0,The dumbest thing I have ever seen in my life.  Am I missing something here?  I was bored to tears and hated it.  What a waste of time and money...especially in Vegas.\nStupid is an understatement!
1,"I left this check-in tip and now am expanding into a review.  BTW, a good way to capture and \""image\"" of someplace that you can further develop later. \""M - F 7-11 five buck special.  What a deal for a simple meal\"".\n\nLet me explain why a three-star v. four:  Salt!  There was so much large grain salt on everything that it made eating, let alone tasting, very difficult.  Our hope is that this is an isolated incident and I will amend when we return...soon.\n\nChef:  pls check your prep in the kitchen and monitor the amount of salt.\n\nFried potatoes were nicely seared chunks, but we had to scrape off the salt.  Ditto the wonderful sausage gravy over biscuits. How frustrating to realize the savory flavors, the best such gravy I have had in years, but the salt overload prevented us from wolfing it all down.\n\nBut I digress... \n\nThis is an unassuming cafe, now restaurant opened by a chef couple who had worked at one of Charlotte's top restaurants.  The menu and ingredients reflect their exposure to more gourmet delights.  They serve Breakfast, lunch and dinner with some items carrying over from the previous menu.\n\nI had the lobster omelet...really!  Made with sweet sauteed onions, cheese and asparagus.  What a treat for an early morning wake-up breakfast.  Cinnamon crunch waffle with bananas was like pastry.  Another treat.\n\nAnd the eggs are made to order and they do an excellent sunny side up version.\n\nAsk to look at the lunch and dinner menus as just reading the offerings will seduce you into returning to try.\n\nWe are anxious to return in the hopes that the salting is left more to the consumer than the kitchen.  \n\nFlipside is special and worth your exploration."
0,"Dr. Mason is the worst doctor I have ever gone to!!  He is belittling, has no bed-side mannerisms, and doesn't really hear what the patient is trying to tell him.  I left his office in tears...my self esteem and total worthiness of being a human being went flying out the door.  My first meeting with this doctor was to get my prescriptions renewed and to see if he had recommendations of weight loss programs.  I got my prescriptions renewed but will never, ever go back for follow up appointments."
1,"We really like this place because there's never a wait to order, the food is freshly made and really good.  If you don't mind the wait for made-to-order, this is the place.  Prices are reasonable and you can hear the conversation if you dine in.  A local favorite.  Try it, you will not be disappointed!"
1,This place has the coolest basement bar.  And now the have a menu from the Blue Adobe Grill across the street.   Very very cool.
1,"Yelps 365 Review Challenge 2014 - Los Angeles #37 - #365\n\nSeveral years ago, this use to be a Korean restaurant and now Roy's Raw Deal now occupies it. I was looking to try a different sushi restaurant instead of my usual, \""Ken's\"" on Foothill.\n\nThe size is very intimate and the staff were very friendly. Roy always ask if you're allergic to any types of fish and that's very reassuring to know he cares about his customers. It can get busy on the weekends, so it's best to come as early as possible to get a good seat. Patrons are friendly and has the small town feel. \n\nSushi was very very fresh! \n\nService was excellent!\n\nAfter a long late night out of walking up and down the strip with my friend, we were hungry and didn't want to eat too far from the hotel. We wanted to something fast and not overpriced, so we chose the Terrace Pointe Cafe inside the Wynn Casino. \n\nAs with everything else in the Wynn, the Terrace Pointe Cafe was a high end 24/7 Cafe with views of the Wynn Pool Area and has outdoor seating. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nDrinks \n+Orange Juice $6\n+Sprite $4\n\nEntrees\n+12 oz. New York Steak $32\n-fingerling potatoes, herb saut\u00e9ed vegetables, red wine reduction\n\n+Grilled Atlantic Salmon $23\n-creamy corn, potato succotash, grilled asparagus, chili oil\n\nThe food and service 5 stars all the way but the prices hurt our wallets! =/\n\nNext time we'll just head to Denny's to save a few $$ but if you're looking for the Wynn dining experience in the wee hours of the day, than Terrace Pointe Cafe is a great option for you."
0,"I will admit, at first I was impressed with the modern look of the resort and the rooms were beautiful.  I liked the security at the elevators also...the checking of the key cards gave me a sense of safety....BOY WAS I WRONG!!!\n\nMy husband and I stayed there October 2012 ...the pool was lovely, the room service was quick...everything seemed great.  \n\nThen, on the last day when we were packing to go home, we realized that one of our shopping bags was missing! $300.00 of merchandise STOLEN!!!  We contacted the maid service...nothing. We contacted the front desk...nothing.  We contacted the loss prevention dept...nothing.  Security said they would have to look into it.  We gave them times, dates everything they needed to find out what happened to the bag....one month later, we received a letter from the resort stating that they had done a full investigation, and found no wrong doing.  WHAT!???  Doesn't act like a \""5star resort\"" to me!!\n\nTo make a long story short, DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT YOUR THINGS STOLEN!!!!!\n\nPERIOD"
0,"When a place is called M:Brgr, you're going in there for the burgers and that's what I'm rating this place based on.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's an EXCELLENT place to go, order a $50 pitcher and enjoy it with your friends as hot waitresses come and ask you if everything is alright. With the music, fancy walls, tables and bar - it's a great pub-like place.\n\nAs a restaurant... Eeeeeehh... Not so much.\n\nAs always, when rating the burger I go for the classic to have a level-ground with all other burger joints in Montreal.\n\nHere, the burger is either a $10 regular burger, a $15 or something slightly bigger regular burger and then it whizzes to a $40 Kobe beef monstrosity with fois gras, blue cheese black truffles. You can even customise your own burger, adding shredded white truffles for $10, blue cheese for $10. Really, it is in the realm of possibility to make a $100 burger.\n\nThe regular burger: Meh. Meh. MEH! I got the regular burger and an apple cider (I've never tried that before - I lived in a country where buying alcohol was not permitted outside of a 5-star hotel). The sauce, whose name I can no longer remember, which they put on the burger is basically ketchup and mayo. Not so great. The meat? Tasted like McD's. Again, this is THE CLASSIC, REGULAR BURGER. I'm not paying $40 for a Kobe beef BURGER! If I'm gonna pay for Kobe beef, I'm having it as a steak, damn it!\n\nReally, I haven't got much to say about this place - the service is slow as HELL!! It's completely ridiculous. The food is expensive and the drinks are even more expensive.\n\nLike I said, you have some money to spare and want a really fancy bar to order a $50 pitcher of vodka and lemonade, then this place is by all means a place to go to. If you want to go for their Brgr (cheap shot - forgive me) then go, but the \""U\"" and \""E\"" are missing from the name because the burger is also lacking in contentment."
0,"I made the mistake of buying some major appliances through Home Depot.  It has been nothing but a long series of problems.  I won't bore you with all of the details, but I will sum it up by saying that even getting a hold of someone in customer service is very difficult. I kept getting passed off to GE, the vendor, who could not help either.\n  There were issues with them trying to substitute a different model without telling, being out of stock for 3 weeks, but not telling me until the day before scheduled delivery.  Then pushing it back yet another month.  I received phone calls saying one thing that contradicted emails saying another."
0,"I called my doctor for a refill and they said call the pharmacy. I called the pharmacy and faxed it over to my doctors. I called the doctors and they said they didn't get it. I called the pharmacy and they faxed it with me there. I call the doctor...well you get it. Finally they said it takes 72 hours. Really!? And they couldn't even tell me if it could be called in for a refill so I asked so do I just make an appointment to make sure and they couldn't tell me. I'm not the professional here, I need some assistance from you and the next appointment was so far out I couldn't believe it."
0,"Came here for lunch because it was convenient.  It's a pretty restaurant.  With the openness and tree lights, etc.  Food was fine.  I liked the presentation of the chips and three types of salsa on a baking sheet.  I'm going to steal that idea.  I was happy they served sangria.  Service was very attentive."
0,Congratulations on selling mexican food with no flavor. Everything we had here was awful and bland. -1 star for this place.
0,"So, it was just okay ice cream. My biggest complaint was not that. It was actually.... the spoons. I don't want rough wood on my tongue. There I said that phrase out loud, and I would actually not eat there again just because of the coarse wooden spoons. I wasn't the only one in our birthday group that made the, It-feels-like-I-just-licked-a-napkin face. In fact, one of the girls' spoon snapped in two while trying to scoop some of the gummy chocolate out of hers. She threw the almost full cup now with splinter sprinkles away.\nI've had better ice cream at Baskin Robbins and made no spoon induced grimaces while doing it."
0,"Be careful of the dealership you choose to buy a Cadillac... \n\nWe were in the process of looking for a new Cadillac Escalade and at first the sales person was helpful in showing us a 2015 and we test drove the car a few weeks back.  We told him we had an Escalade that we were trading in and that we had just started looking and considering our options.  \n\nWe contacted the same sales person this past weekend and asked if he had a 2015 Escalade in inventory which he stated he did and we advised him that we would be coming by this past Saturday to see the car.  When we arrived the Sales Manager immediately took our keys to our Escalade and ran inside to get the General Manager, Tom, to have him look at our car.  \n\nWell, needless to say, this totally started out the wrong way from the very beginning.......... Tom, the General Manager, walked right past us and did not even acknowledge us.  His attitude was curt, very rude, negative and condescending.\n\nThe Sales Manager and Tom immediately started talking money (mind you we haven't even seen the car they supposedly had on the lot yet) and the pricing was different from what the Sales Manager had originally quoted by about a $2000-$2500 difference.  Not a lot in comparison to buying a $100,000 car, although, it is the principle, and we had not even seen the car.  \n\nWhen we asked if we could see the car they had on the lot they stated they must have just sold it and that they could not get another Escalade for about 2-3 months.  Tom went back to his office to see if there was another Escalade available and said that there was one although they would not have it in inventory for about 2-3 weeks.  Then he proceeded to tell us there were no Black Raven/Kona 2015 Escalades in AZ, maybe one in CA and 0 in NV.  We asked if they traded with other dealerships and again he stated there were none in AZ.  \n\nWe had purchased our previous Escalade when Earnhardt was Legends which was a good experience.  Going to Earnhardt was such a huge let down, they were so unbelievably rude, unprofessional and honestly they did not know the product they were selling.  Needless to say we were extremely disappointed in the way this whole situation was handled.  This was the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE we have ever experienced and we left abruptly.  \n\nBottom line.... . we looked online that same day and low and behold we found 4 Black Raven/Kona 2015 Escalades, in AZ no doubt, and at Arrowhead Cadillac in Glendale.  \n\nJust fyi Earnhardt Cadillac...we drove off the lot on Sunday with our brand new 2015 Black Raven / Kona Interior Escalade from Arrowhead Cadillac.   \n\nFor those of you considering a Cadillac purchase, do not waste your time at Earnhardt Cadillac, make the drive and go to Arrowhead Cadillac in Glendale.  Arrowhead offered us the most incredible, professional experience we have ever had and they treat you like a person should be treated, with a little respect.   Everyone was happy, the dealership is beautiful and the Sales Managers know what they are doing, this was such a fun and seamless experience.  Arrowhead has earned our business."
0,"I could not be more annoyed by this company if I tried!!!  Purchased the voucher through Living Social on July 7 and had an appt. scheduled for the 24th.  They were a No Show.  I phoned Maid by Design and no one answers the phone.  I called Living Social and they got in touch with owner, Terry, who told them my appt. was for the 31st (not true).  So, I tried to call to confirm the appt. for today and still no answer.  No one showed up this morning at the appointed time.  I called Living Social and told them I wanted a refund and they agreed to return the charges to my credit card.  STAY AWAY FROM MAID BY DESIGN...SOMETHING SMELLS REALLY ROTTEN WITH THIS BUSINESS."
0,"BJ's...what has happened to you?\nI always thought you were above average, but today was a terrible experience.  We arrived after the regular lunch crowd and had to take a buzze and waitr.  At least half of the tables were empty, so we assumed maybe some of the staff had called in sick.\nWe waited almost 20 minutes and were finallly buzzed.  Our waiter was way out in lala land.  He took our drink orders and brought have of them and then told the rest of us, \""I had forgot what your ordered.\""  We both ordered...ice tea!  He was very unattentive.  We had to get up and find our own napkins and flatware.  After a hamburger was brought, we had to find our own ketchup and mustard.  We were brought wrong orders and were never offered refills on our drinks.\nWe were very disappointed in our service and the food was just OK."
0,"Eh. I was underwhelmed. I ordered pad thai and my portion was small and relatively tasteless. Trader Joe's frozen pad thai is far and above this place.  No knives on the table and I and my companions all struggled to eat with some modicum of table manners. My friends had the crispy fried duck drunken noodles and the catfish and they were all very pleased. Guess i just ordered the wrong thing.\n\nAddendum -- ok I tried it again today, sampled across a lot of the menu (a big group of us ordered a ton of different stuff).  Even more disappointed this time.  Ick.  This is the Thai equivalent of McDonald's or Applebees.  If you are in Vegas and want decent Thai, try Pan Asian restaurant on S. Durango St."
0,If I could give no stars I would.this place is a pathetic excuse. They do not acknowledge your presence one bit. Pretty sad since their items I would have wanted to rent since I am a customer frequent online. Although since I wasnt even noticed nor my husband they lost a customer. If managment does read this please do your self a favor and RE-train your staff for both females wish I got or saw their name does not know what customer service is.
1,Nice people. Bomb a$$ bibimbap. I'm sold.
0,"I wasn't overly impressed last time I was here, but at least I was treated well and was served what I expected to be served. It was enjoyable and I said I would go back.\n\nLast night, I did.\n\nI was dining alone before an appointment nearby and wanted a glass of wine and a salad before I started my evening. When I walked in they were buzzing, but not overly busy. As it was just me tonight, I accepted the offer to take one of the 2-top tables in the bar. The other table in this area was taken and already had at least one glass of wine and menus.\n\n** 1-8 minutes ** \n\nAt least three employees walked by both me and the other table without acknowledging us at all. A waitress eventually came over and addressed the fact that she was flagged down, and I heard the other patron ask for the wine list \""again.\"" The waitress ran to grab one, passing me without a look, and returned... again without a look. I tried to get her attention and she kept going.\n\nShe walked by one more time, in a hurry, not stopping at either table but this time acknowledging me. I had hope!\n\nNo go. She did not return.\n\nI asked a busser if there was a different waitress for my table (sounded odd, but I have seen it before) and he seemed to think she was it. I asked if the bartender could help me and he said yes, but only if I was sitting at the bar.\n\n** 9-13 minutes **\n\nSupposedly, someone was coming to help me. Passed by again by at least three people. Waiting, waiting, asking...\n\n** 13-16 minutes **\n\nGot up, went the desk, and \""my\"" waitress (which one should be in quotes now, I am debating) was more worried about a phone number and chatting with the girl at the desk than even looking at the patron standing next to her. The hostess thanked me for coming and I was going to talk to her about what happened, but she engaged in chat with the others and essentially turned away. \n\nI grabbed the manager's business card and left.\n\nGoing back now? Much of the experience IS the service... and last night was ridiculous... ridiculously bad and nowhere near \""service.\"""
0,"They serve Americanized Chinese dishes, which is strange. My friend got the duck soup. There were tons of bones in it, including little ones. She didn't eat much of it. The prices are also expensive. You can do karaoke here, but it's expensive too. I basically left this place feeling like I didn't get my money's worth. Oh, and they have a credit card limit of $20 so my party of four who wanted to split the check had to pay each other back after charging one card. The service wasn't great either...will not be going back."
0,"negative stars abound.\n\nI receive an ontrac delivery note on my mailbox.  1st attempt delivery.  I called them to change the address so my order ships to my office.  The woman took down the new address and told me i needed to call amazon and authorize the address change.  i get off the phone with her, i call amazon, i explain the need to change the address and they conference call in a representative from ontrac who confirmed that the new address and that they would deliver to my office and not my home.  I do not receive the package the next day.  I come home to find a second delivery attempt notice on my mailbox from ontrac.  \n\nAfter specifically asking and confirming the new address this second delivery attempt seems ridiculous. It also seems ridiculous that their pick up location is in SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO nowhere near public transportation.\n\nI'm ready to have them return my order to Amazon so I can have it delivered via UPS."
0,I went in to buy some Bare minerals and had hoped to get color matched for a new line of liquid makeup and despite the place crawling with not only regular associates but bare minerals associates touting their new product I was completely ignored. In fact all but pushed out of the way from someone doing a makeup consult on someone else. Now I don't blame her for not helping she was busy but not even a quick hi or can I get someone to help you nothing I stood there for ten minutes and got absolutely no help. This is not the first time I've had iffy service from this store but this was by far the worst.  The only good thing that happened was there was absolutely no line which was amazing considering every other time the line has been horrid.  So I think a little planning is due maybe I'll just start buying my makeup on line I get about the same amount of service.
0,"Ok not sure if I would make another trip had better in town,really kind of disappointing"
1,"By far the best sashimi in Arizona. Fresh, large slices, & reasonably priced. Id stay away from the fried rolls, filled with a lot of imitation crab. But highly recommend the sashimi plate."
1,"This place was AMAZING. Up until I went to Stripsteak my favorite steak place was Cut by Wolfgang puck. But, given that everything here was amazing (the appetizers, main meal, sides AND desert) it is an overall winner and now at the top of my list. I'm just sad that it is in Vegas and not in LA. Also - I figured it was about $200 less than Cut for the same meal / alcohol combo. Be sure to get the donuts with dipping sauce at the end of the night!"
1,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWEVx1Tave4&feature=related\n\nWhat started off as a city to let loose and have a little fun has become my second home.\n\nAt first, Las Vegas was strictly confined to the narrow boarders of The Strip.\nAnd can you blame me?\nBlazing bright neon lights, ceaseless sounds of spinning slot machines, crazed crowds looking to party, and enough food and drink for a lifetime of total and utter debauchery.\nIt was HELLA FUN.\n\nBut things change when friends and family decided to live here.\nWho knew there was more to Las Vegas than The Strip?\nThere are parks, churches, schools, libraries, grocery stores, a million strip malls . . . . you know everyday kinda stuff.  It weirded me thinking that people could 1) live here and 2) seriously, people really do live out here.\nBut it's cool - now.\n\nI still enjoy an occasional Vegas getaway when needing to chill or the 2-4 bug bites; although, I have toned things down a little.\nDon't get me wrong, I'll still hit The Strip once in awhile.  I just have to temper the partying knowing that I may have an early tee time the next day.\n\nBTW, did I ever tell you the time I almost vomited on Paris Hilton?\nSad but True story."
1,Thin & crispy gluten free crust with unlimited toppings for $12. Tastes good and I only ate half. Worth it!
0,"SO beyond dissapointed  with Rachels Kitchen. I placed a delivery order at 11:15 and was quoted a 30 minute wait time. When we had been waiting 45 minutes I called to find out if they were on their way. A very rude guy answered the phone and said my order had been ready and was waiting there to be picked up. When I said it was for delivery he said \""No its not\"" and hung up on me. I called back only for him to answer again. He placed me on a 11 minute hold and the woman who answered said they would remake my sandwich and 2 juices and send them right out. It is now 12:45 and I just called back to find out they had not been sent out yet. What a fail! So dissapointed Rachels Kitchen. Get your ish together."
0,"*le sigh* \n\nI really didn't want it to come to this because well, as a vegan there are very few places I can go to eat, but after disappointment after disappointment I'm sorry to say I will not be coming back to Pura Vida any time soon. This was my letter to Chef Mayra after the Titanic x Hindenburg disaster that was their Valentine's Day dinner. \n\n\""I hate to say it but I am livid and a bit appalled after tonight's Valentine's dinner. We paid $75 for 15 courses; you gave up after 12, and a couple of the courses were thrown & plated together last minute instead of being the separate courses they were advertised as. When you pay for something, you should receive it. Not only were we denied the extra courses, but it took forever to get them - you asked us to come early and that dinner would be served 6-9 PM; the first course wasn't even served until 6:40 PM. We left at 10 PM (we had plans at 9:30 - oh well!) confused as to where the rest of the courses were. There was very little explanation or communication and definitely poor planning. As a vegan I was excited for this opportunity and have eaten at your establishment many times, as well as referred you to others, but this will most likely be my last time. My husband really wanted this year to be special, but it was a huge headache. If you do this next year I hope you severely edit the menu and the prices so everyone leaves satisfied and at the designated time. You knew how many people were coming well in advance and should have had a test run of some sort. The only semblance of apology came from your servers when the food was not being served in the beginning. My husband is now even complaining he's still hungry as we didn't eat earlier in the day to fit this event in! This is one of the worst of not the absolute worst restaurant experiences I have ever been privy to and I hope to never repeat this episode of Vegan Survivor ever again.\""\n\nI appreciate that everything is made ready-to-order, but when you're serving FIFTEEN courses to 40 guests who you asked to arrive early and did actually have a definitive ending time of 9 PM, you have to make sure it goes smoothly which it did not. My husband and I were starved for over an hour before the food started coming. We estimated our time of exit by how \""quickly\"" the food was coming out and it should have ended past midnight! Completely awful. A bunch of people left (and I wish I were one of them), and I'm pretty sure every single person left unsatisfied. \n\nThis establishment has absolutely 0 business acumen and it is going to hurt them. You don't even have to watch a couple episodes of Kitchen Nightmares to realize Pura Vida is doing it wrong. If you have to come out and explain every menu item as well as feel the need to put pictures of the food in the convoluted menu, as a diner you should run immediately. \n\nNow I was going to give Pura Vida the benefit of the doubt since they did email the patrons and offered the rest of the courses, we just had to email & give the time we're coming in. Which my husband did. And apparently he had to confirm back which was not explained whatsoever. So he is currently at Pura Vida waiting for them to make the final meal we will enjoy from there. \n\nI sincerely wish Chef Mayra luck (she's going to need it!) but I will not be back. \n\nP.S. To the servers - good luck, you were the best part of the place, always trying to make it work when you are as confused as the customer, and I hope she supplies plenty of aspirin for the hourly headaches you have to have from working there."
1,"Pretty cool.  the rooms have these insane projector screens.  I did not like the fact that there was no casino in the lobby and they did not heat their outdoor pool.  other than that, it was great...."
1,"Wow.  Unexpected, incredible surprise.  Food was amazing, every course absolutely perfect with diverse tastes and vibrant flavors. I have a spoiled palette and I will have trouble going anywhere else in Las Vegas.  Foodies, try Sage, stat! Also, our waiter, Bond, Julian Bond was awesome and very fun.  If you are lucky enough to get him, let him order for you.  We were blown away."
0,"Stay away! This place used to be awesome! I probably spent around $500 here since I learned about it, but unfortunately they replaced all of their management with new people.\n\nNormally, this wouldn't be an issue. But the new management informed me that they no longer do any of the deals that the old management did. Also, the new management was incredibly rude. Every time I asked them a question, they would stare at me like I was stupid. I really liked chatting with the old employees as they were actually nice to people.\n\nNeedless to say, I am taking my business elsewhere and will never go back. I put up with the insane prices because I liked the employees, now it is just insane prices and rude employees.\n \nGo elsewhere or order online, it will be cheaper for you."
0,"Amateur customer service, dishonest, and very little business sense. \n\nI was really looking forward to finding a great dentist in Tempe and had hopes this was it.  Unfortunately, the facts of my experience  have to support otherwise. Allow me to explain:\n\n1) Called to schedule an appointment without problem.  They answer promptly, and schedule out for just over a week's time.  The appointment is on a Friday at 1pm.  Great so far.\n\n2) They ask for insurance information in which I did not have on me at the time.  I called back and  they take the information down and indicate they support my insurance.  They explain they will call them and get any additional information they need from them.  They then proceed to make their first mistake and confirm a 12:30 appointment time.  I check my calendar and correct that we scheduled for a 1pm.  She indicated she sees where she messed up and says sorry and asks for a change to 12:45.  That is no problem on my end I say and that is that. \n\n3) I receive a reminder phone call a few days before the appointment and they are calling to confirm 12:30.  I can't believe how inept they are beginning to sound in their scheduling department.  Starting to worry me now about my decision to choose this dentist office.\n\n4) I to my appointment and fill out the paperwork needed.  Upon turning it in, they look to see I have filled out my insurance portion and they proceed to ask, \""oh, you do have insurance, we don't have you down as having insurance\"" .  Keep in mind bullet 2 where I made a phone call to them specifically giving them my insurance information.\n\n5) Waiting a few more minutes they explain they are going to have to do another full set of x rays on my mouth.  Typically, a full set is allowed by insurance once every 5 years on a patient. This is in the range of $500 to get these done.  In between these full mouth x rays, dentist commonly use the bite wings where you bite down on a white wing and they take a small x ray of that portion of your mouth to check for cavities etc...  \n  I explain that I have had one of these full mouth x rays performed within the last five years (only 6 months ago in fact) and gave them information of the dentist where they can request the x ray.  \n  They say they don't do this and they must do another full mouth x ray not covered by insurance just to see me.  This is a common practice to do DOUBLE BILLING to take advantage of those that do not know better and to get extra money.  This was enough and I excused myself from their office.  If their are this many problems before I even get in the chair, I worry about how many mistakes and problems they will create intentionally or not in my mouth.  \n  It is very clear now they are not only unable to run a customer oriented business, but are also dishonest in their business dealings.  \n\nDO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRACTICE.  \n  Let them \""practice\"" on individuals not looking for a life long dentist."
0,ick. i wanted regular bbq wings with regular bbq sauce and they put hot sauce in the bbq. the vinegar  on hot wings gives me a headache so i can only eat bbq. she kept trying to tell me that i wanted them medium heat.. i dunno.. not going there again i dont think.. at least not to eat
1,Our Cook was really funny. Dinner was great. Loved the shrimp and steak. Next time gonna go with more people. Benihanas is definetly a place to go with a group. Me and my girl were sitting with total strangers.
1,"This place can get pretty busy and with the location it can be a slight bit of a challenge getting in and out of here but this place services a large population in the area so I can't blame them. \n\nI had to write this review specifically for one guy, Tony. \n\nI was trying to print out some business cards the other day and the printer went haywire. Even though Tony looked extremely busy he took a whole bunch of his time trouble shooting my file, trying different methods to print it and eventually giving me a lot of credit back due to the problems with my file and the business card papers I brought in. \n\nAnother thing that impressed me was all the customers coming in and saying hi to him and he knew most all of them by name.  Service like that will make this my go to FedEx location. Thanks for your help Tony!"
1,"The list of Vegas buffets that I have been to is kind of embarrassingly long. I swear, I am not THAT much of a glutton. In my defense, we've had a number of visitors over the past year and they almost always want to experience a strip buffet so we usually add it to the list of attractions as we are playing tour guide. And I was a frequent tourist to Vegas myself back before I lived here, and so like any good little tourist I had to check out the buffets.\n\nBut really, overall, there is just something about the ridiculous opulence and over-the-top decadence of a fancy mega buffet that appeals to me. I don't have to stuff myself to get my money's worth! It's just fun to experience.\n\nSo, anyway, Bacchanal is the best buffet on the strip- yes, better than Wicked Spoon, its chief rival at this point. Yes there are crazy long lines (but wait! If you are willing to pay for convenience, you can skip the line for $15/person, a bargain when everyone is waiting 2+ hours to get in!) and it is a tad pricey but it is worth the cost. There are so many dishes to choose from and just about everything is delicious (with a few exceptions; for example, I would avoid the sushi station). The small individual portions are 1. cute, 2. more hygienic than a big communal pile and 3. allow you to sample more things before feeling too full! It is a little annoying having to juggle all of the tiny plates but I like the concept.\n\nThe seafood station is pretty great with piles and piles of crab. They have awesome mac 'n' cheese and the most fantastic little mini burgers that are packed with flavor. Lots of tasty potato-y sides (truffled scallop potatoes, potato pancakes, tater tots), delicious fried chicken, good pasta, an awesome watermelon-feta salad... good meats, and AWESOME desserts. SAVE ROOM for dessert; they have baklava gelato! And Aztec chocolate and a ridiculous pile of other awesome flavors. There are cookie and candy jars, little mini cakes, souffl\u00e9s straight out of the oven.\n\nAnyway, from now on I will be taking visitors here as the example of BEST Vegas buffet. The dining room is snazzy, the food is great and there is plenty of it and it displays the kind of (yes) bacchanalian opulence you can only find here. Awesome!"
1,I had the beginning festivities of my 21st birthday party at OHSO. We had a dinner and were able to reserve tables for my group. They were very easy to work with and even let us set out decorations and bring our own cake!! Some places don't let you bring outside food in - so it was so great that they let us bring our own cake because it was custom made and beautiful. OHSO has the best mojitos I have ever had. They have a great atmosphere outside in the back which is where we were. The food is awesome. I would definitely make it a regular spot to eat and drink
1,"I ordered Eggs Benedict and toast with avocados,salsa tomato n poached egg are for breakfast .  The poached egg is so good which is a really  liquid yolk inside! Everything is really  good. Then I had  a breakfast smoothie which are mixed banana n berries. it's a good ending.  What a good morning!"
0,"My  partner  was  in  Banner  Del  Webb  Hospital  twice  in  a  six  week  period.  The  emergency  room  was  a  zoo  of  young  thoughtless  nurses  and  doctors. Very  poor  attitudes  and  not  listening  to  the  problem.  Young,  smart-ass,  know  it  all  attitudes.  Hospital  floor  3 D  is  the  pits.  Lousy  housekeeping,  bed  not  changed  in  3  days,  wastebaskets  not  dumped, floor  in  room  and  bathroom  filthy.  Toilet  seat  not  bolted  down  and  easy  for  an  elderly  patient  to  fall  off.  Some  staff  was  very  good  but  several  were  absolutly  terrible.  Whole  attitude  on  floor  3 D  needs improving.  \n\nVery  mediocre  place.  Avoid  Banner  Del  Webb  if  you  can.  Go  elsewhere."
0,Not even a one star.... Came gave estimate and never returned where they said they would the next day...bad service
0,For a busy place they are top of there game. Food was just so so for me. The burger has this crust around it that kinda hurts the gums and roof of your mouth when you bite into. Pretty sure it was the cheese the melts over. Get by the crusty part and the burger does taste fresh. If you like skinny shoestring crunchy fries then you will love these. For me not so much it was like eating warmed up potato sticks from a can. I did see managers and maybe a owner going around asking what they thought they never did come by our table prob since most of the fries and 1/3 of the burger was sitting there untouched. If it was the owner he was sitting outside playing with his cell phone more then asking people what they thought and it was lunch time. Personally I'll stick with Five Guys. Little more expensive but you get what you pay for with Five Guys!!!!
1,"Excellent food!  Delicious egg drop soup, chinese chicken curry, and egg foo yung. Da bomb!  Nice staff... The fried rice is fairly dark but tasty."
1,"I tought the buffet was a little pricy at first (30$ + taxes and service on for a sunday brunch), but honnestly this is one of the greatest buffet I went to. Lot of choice, great selection of meat, asian food, dessert, seafood, sandwiches breakfast items... I only wish I was more hungry when I was there! Its worth the price, plus if you have comps on your m-life card you can redeem them there."
1,"This was a strange review to write as the food is top notch and deserves five stars. The only reason I gave it four was due to two issues that will be irrelevant to some people. First, the cheapest bottle of red wine was $70, which I think is ridiculous. I don't think it's asking too much to have a $50 bottle of wine on your menu. I like wine with food, but am not a connoisseur, so the difference between a $50 bottle and a $100 bottle is nil to me. Second, you're much better served going with a group of four or larger. Sides and appetizers state they serve two to four and they are huge and way too large for two people. You will also have far more seafood options if you are ordering for more than two people as the seafood bar (more to come later) selections are usually two pounds or more. \n\nOn to the food...amazing. Your server will take you to what is essentially a seafood market inside of the restaurant. There is a large bed of ice on which are laid their seafood selections for the evening. Each selection has a small sign which indicates the name of the selection and the price per pound. Most were in the $50/lb. range. We had originally ordered a Mediterranean Sea Bass, but it was only available at two lbs. or larger, so she recommended a similar selection that I can neither remember nor pronounce, at a pound and a half. Two lbs. would have been far too large for the two of us and we were not interested in leftovers. The seafood was so fresh and simply prepared. It was grilled, lightly seasoned and topped with a little oil. They let the seafood be the star and it is incredible. Our appetizer was the spreads, which included Tzatziki, Hummus, Tarmosalata and Fava. It was great, but it was so large we maybe ate a third of it at most as we didn't want to fill up on an appetizer. With the seafood we also ordered a side of their grilled peppers. Again, great, but a huge portion and over half of it was uneaten. Outstanding meal all the way around, but paid for a good amount of food we couldn't eat. Also, it's pretty amazing that all the fresh seafood can be on ice in the middle of the restaurant and yet no \""fishy\"" smell."
1,"READ THIS FIRST! Review from one who disliked cabo fish taco. \n\nEntires ordered: \n- blackened chicken quesadilla; \n- epic tuna burrito; \n- blackened mahi mahi tacos; \n- blackened grilled amberjack tacos (on special)\n\nThis is my second visit to this restaurant, previously I would haven given this -1/2 star. \n\nChips and salsa:  the other 3 in the party loved the salsa, it is a corn/tomato salsa. Personally, I am not a fan of this type of salsa, I like the traditional kind so I'm not able to provide an unbiased review. The chips have a stale texture, this is consistent from both visits, this may be just how the chips are supposed to be. Not a fan personally here either. \n\nEntrees: \nBlackened chicken quesadilla (mine) - not your standard quesadilla, not overloaded with cheese. Good balance of chicken-to-cheese ratio. The blackening is second to none, this was an pleasant surprise and delivered a very nice kick. Onions and peppers were good, not too much, just the right amount. I don't eat seafood, that's why I didn't get a \""fish taco.\"" \n\nEpic tuna burrito- very good, comparable in quality/flavor of fresh California fish (according to the diner)\n\nBlackened mahi tacos- delicious. \n\nBlackened amberjack - the diner went on and on about these, refused to try anything else because she didn't want to \""ruin her palate.\"" (Tad dramatic if you ask me, but what do I know). \n\nMy review rating is based upon my entr\u00e9e and the opinions voiced by my cohorts. They truly loved everything (although they did share my feelings on the \""stale chips\""). \n\nMy original experience was terrible, I don't remember what I had exactly but it was bad enough that I successfully boycotted this place 3 years. However, after the blackened chicken quesadilla, I will be willing to return. \n\nAlso, one had a Bloody Mary (on special) and said it was \""delicious.\"" \n\nNote: parking is a real pain, just be prepared for that."
1,"Great park with open spaces, softball fields, basketball courts, and sand volleyball courts in addition to the tennis center. I walk here almost every day when visiting Scottsdale."
0,"I stayed at the Monte Carlo Fri 8/22-Sun 8/24/14. I know it's not the nicest or newest place, but the price is right & it's in a good location on the Strip. I've stayed before with no issues, but after this last trip I will NEVER stay there again.\n\nI went to Vegas with my sister & one of my best girlfriends. We checked in late Friday night (11pm). We were in our room for about an hour so we could freshen up, regroup with friends & then we went downstairs to gamble & drink. We were out of our room for less than 4 hours. Somewhere in that time frame, all the cash we left in our purses in the room was stolen (a total of around $650). We noticed the next day when we woke up. \n\nWe reported the theft to hotel management & security. We initially spoke to Ryan, position unknown, as he wasn't wearing a name tag. Ryan accessed their computer system which shows each time a door is opened by a guest or their staff. Long story short, the \""system\"" shows that we did not close the door all the way when we left. There is no way this was possible. The door is so heavy it closes on its own. Their \""system\"" also alerted them to this issue 10 mins after we left the room & security did nothing. Second manager named Celeste came over. They refused to comp our room and only offered a $100 credit towards food & drink. We demanded to move rooms and were told we were being upgraded to a suite. Upon entering the new room, we found it to be the same layout as our first room, just on a different floor. Julius, security personnel, wrote a report on a scratch piece of paper. My sister & I wrote statements. The police were never called. We were told this incident would be referred to Risk Management & they would follow up in 3-4 days after an \""investigation\"". Over a week later and no word from the hotel. \n\nUpon my return back to work on Monday 8/25/14, my coworker asked about my trip. When I told her the story, she asked \""Wait, where did you stay?\"" Turns out she stayed at the Monte Carlo in June with her sister & their boyfriends. Their boyfriends went to EDC & the girls didn't. My friend was sick & knocked out on cold medication, but her sister woke up in the middle of the night to find a man in their room. He said he was \""security\"" and was checking a \""report\"" of their door being left open. Super shady business going on at this place! \n\nDO NOT STAY HERE! If you must, use the safe AND deadbolt your door!! There are NO cameras in the hallway, so definitely stay at your own risk."
0,"This place get a four stars in Las Vegas. In my opinion,  they  are a solid two stars in regards to taste. I am thinking that people were still drunk when they wrote their reviews. I started off with a Vietnamese coffee, I was tired, but I couldn't bring myself to down more than 3 sips. The theme of the day was salty. The coffee was salty and the Pho was salty. Save your $26 and go eat at Mr.Mama. It's not Vietnamese food, but at least it's delicious."
1,"Carmon's is the restaurant gem hidden away in Champaign. I go there with my girlfriend to eat steak and crepes. The food has been consistently good, and their specials are always interesting.\n\nThe menu is small, but for Carmon's, this is a good thing since everything on the menu is delicious. I particularly like the steak and fries, and my girlfriend often gets the beef stroganoff crepe.\n\nThe waitstaff are very talkative and interesting people, and make the place seem very friendly. It gives a pleasant atmosphere to the place.\n\nOverall if you're looking for good steak and good crepes, you can't beat Carmon's in Champaign."
0,I went to this Pita J and sat at the bar.  I liked watching all of the cooks bust their butts to get the food out.  But the waiters...yelling at the cooks and not saying please and thank you!  Putting their fingers and hands in and on top of the food that they are going to serve to customers... The money tip goes to the hard working cooks and not the waiters.  Wont be going to this Pita J again...maybe one of the other Pita J's will have a better attitude towards their cooks.
1,"Amazing sandwiches! So many options and there's even more online! The sandwiches are HUGE! My fianc\u00e9 and I both ended up only eating half and he can eat, so I would recommend sharing a sandwich if you don't like leftovers. Great music as well."
1,I am a red ligh runner too.  I did not want to go and was not happy about the money that came out of my savings to pay my ticket and attend class (I had another violation that did not qualify me for defensive driving school).  Marcia made the class intresting and painless.  Her cheerful demeanor was also a refreshing aspect to the class.  Definately not how I want to spend a Sunday.  Thanks for getting me through the class.
1,"I went back to  Urban Cookies after a not so hot visit in July if thats even possible.  Anyway, my daughter and I were yearning for a sweet bite and were unusually in the neighborhood so we stopped by.  My daughter got the chocolate cupcake and devoured it within seconds, liked it, but said \""you know I love chocolate but this is too much chocolate\""  so if you like too much chocolate this cupcake is for you.  I on the other hand tried the featured cupcake that was in an orange shell.  I took it home for later that evening.  Well when later came I was in anticipatory mode, hoping beyond hope that this would be the experience I desired from eating way too many calories.  It was AWESOME and I savored every delectable bite!  The name should be changed to Urban Cupcakes which are way better than the cookies in my opinion.  So I will definitely drop by again when in the area and need a cupcake fix.  A Congratulation on the Cupcake Wars win is definitely in order!!!"
1,"My friend from LA was always raving about this place and when I went to Sin City and saw it, had to try it!\n\nI got the double double animal style and woo-hoo it did get the animal in me out and about. It was juicy and I was satiated. I didn't care for the fries and the drink sat in the rental car for 24 hours. \n\nIf you see this spot anywhere in the US and want a nice bag of grease, pop in and try one."
0,"It take a lot for me to really go off on a place.  A LOT.  But Brazewells has earned my displeasure.  \n\nLet me start with at least one positive.  Kelly, behind the bar, is awesome.  She's friendly and knows her stuff.  And that, my fellow yelpers, is where the redeeming qualities end.\n\nRarely have I been where the waitstaff was so clueless and uncaring.  \""May I see a wine list?\"".. \""Oh, uhh.. well, we don't really have one right now... sorry.\""  *crickets*  Are you kidding me?  if I had been here once and heard this, I probably wouldn't mention it, but over a 3-4 month period, I heard this more than once.  My other major complaint is that many of the servers are just rude.  I'll grant, however, that if I had to put up with the usual crowd they draw, I may be, too.  \n\nAfter visiting this place on a Saturday night, I knew it'd be my last visit.  The back patio was WAY overcrowded and packed with self-absorbed douches.  Rudeness gets elevated almost to an art form back there.  Beware, they also allow smoking back there.  Just.. eww!  As we were trying to leave, I had people actually refuse to move so that I could step down off the patio.  Seriously??  Why are there bouncers here?  All they did was watch as I struggled to navigate the insanity.\n\nSkip this drunk and douche infested place and walk across the street to Ten Park Lanes, instead.  You deserve better."
0,I can't believe they charge for one pump of syrup at this store now. I will definitely not come back to this Starbucks.
1,"Holy cow, I thought I had already written a review of this place! I've been coming to Los Jarochos ever since they opened (I was sad that the kabobs place closed though). I had read an article by local food critic Max Jacobson where he said he had really enjoyed the food. \n\nMy husband loves this place. So much so, that when I suggest we check out a new taco tand or head to an old favorite, he feels like he is cheating on the place. Really. When I come here I always order the tostadas de pollo, you can order individually or an order which comes with three. I always go for three, but really two are sufficient. Hubby gets a variety of tacos, lengua, birria, asada, etc. and he loves them all. \n\nThe reason I was compelled to write this review today is because we recently went and I was craving something other than tostadas. Hbby recommended a torta, which he sometimes gets and also loves. HOLY COW! I ordered a torta de asada and my goodness it was extraordinary. The meat had that special sazon that you get when eating food in Mexico and the bread was sooo good! I don't know what they do to it but I dare say it is the best torta in town. The only thing I've ordered and haven't liked were the shrimp empanadas, that had weird little shrimp in it and were off tasting. Also you can get better tacos al pastor elsewhere.\n\nYour best bet here is going for simple dishes; I noticed someone used Roberto's as a comparison, someone also mentioned the tacos have one, not two tortillas. If you are looking for an authentic, inexpensive Mexican restaurant, this is the place."
0,So after 15 years having the best bloody marys around you changed your mix.  The watered down tomato juice out of the gun was horrible.  Drinks use to be good and over priced now they are horrible and over priced.  Won't be enjoying a cocktail here anymore.
0,"Yard house is one of my favorite chain restaurants at Desert Ridge.  I have been there so many times and have usually had great service.  However after the service i received there at dinner this evening i am not sure if i will be returning.  Nor do i think that i will be sending any of my guest there (I work in the front office at one of the Marriott across the street).\nI got there and expected to wait as it was close to 7pm on a friday.  To my surprise the wait time was only 25 which was fine with me.  I buzzer went off and we went to be seated while they walked us through the the restaurant to one of the booths.  I was shocked the party of 2 they were seating in a booth that sat 6.  We passed several 4 top tables in which they could have sat us at and saved the booth for the other groups waiting.  \nOnce we were seated two \""servers\"" came up to the table.  I am assuming one was training but to my surprise i had no clue who was training who and who the actually server was.  We asked fro two waters and they brought those out to us and walked away before we could say anything to them.  Literally 20 mins later they came back and asked if we had a made a decision yet.  We ordered and of course the food came out pretty quick which is standard for Yard house.  One of the food runner brought the food and out and i am assuming one of the managers(wearing a white shirt)  asked how everything was.  I asked if i could get a side of lettuce that wasn't brown and wilted.  She didn't say anything to me and then again asked how everything was i repeated myself.  The she just became very rude and said i will get you lettuce.  She came back with fresh lettuce and didn't say anything once she arrived at the table.  She set it down and walked away before i could even thank her.\nOur \""servers\"" never came back until we were done with our meal.   And then brought the checks.  They were very polite but were lacking a major personality.  And as far as the manager goes maybe it is best if she stays away from tables.  \nAgain the Yard house at Desert Ridge should know that they are going to be busy with all the tourist in the area.  But with the quality of service that i received tonight would not want to make me send anyone to there."
0,"It pains me to write this review. When Fresh & Easy opened its doors in AZ I loved them. I did most of my grocery shopping at the store. The produce, ready-made meals and baked goods were great. It was more like the European way of shopping and that may also have been their downfall. \n\nEver since the company was sold to an American company a few months back, the place has lost much of its appeal. Prices have gone up, and quality has gone down. Variety of quality goods has greatly diminished. This store (the one on Thomas and Hayden) smell so bad when you walk in, and even worse around the bakery case. This is not the case at the Camelback store. Why can't this be fixed?\n\nLast night was probably the last time I set foot in the store. We went to get food and wine for a special dinner. The wine selection had gone from a whole isle to about 1/3 of the size and at least 1/2 of the wines had labels \""temporarily out of stock.\"" The food we wanted and used to be a staple was either out of stock or no longer sold at the store. It was pathetic. We actually left the store and went to Safeway on Chaparral and Hayden.\n\nThe staff in the stores used to be friendly and helpful, now the staff looks miserable and seem to care less about their jobs. The people working the store I shopped at most knew me by name, since the sale they seem to all have been replaced by younger and I suppose cheaper labor. \n\nSorry Fresh and Easy. My love affair has ended. Its time to go elsewhere.\n\nUPDATE 4/7: Shortly after posting this review the Fresh and Easy Listening Team asked me to reach out to them. I sent them a message per their instructions. Almost a month has gone by and no response back. I guess no one is listening. Too bad!!!"
1,"The AT&T Store employees were so helpful when I lost my phone in Montreal.  Peter helped me get a temporary phone and a new one sent to me within 48 hours.  He could not have been more helpful!  And today I went back to have my bill explained to me, and Jay let me know what the charges were for and helped me understand my plan.  5 stars!"
0,"This review is longer over due. As far as waxers go they are very thorough, quick and friendly. The rest of the staff not so much. I stopped going because I always felt pressure into buying things(like putting product on the counter while I'm paying for service) and attitude made me uncomfortable. I went every 3 weeks for almost a year. I just gave up. Nice area, lovely waxers... The rest of the staff not so much. Maybe I'd return, maybe not.\nThey get my recommendation for great waxers, clean place, wonderful location, affordable & last minute appts. That's all"
0,OMG!!! We just came from this place and it was the worst ever.  I give two stars cause our waitress Kerri was very sweet and the busboy was nice.  I ordered orange juice and it tasted like the the film from the dishwasher detergent was still in the glass so I sent it back and the busboy brought me a new glass.  Then my husband gets his food and the eggs were to be scrambled and they were so runny and very undercooked so he put them aside and ate everything else on his plate. Then he is on his second cup of coffee and he looks down into the glass and there is a fly floating on top.  We were glad to get the heck out there.
0,"OMG brutally slow! Your better off watching paint dry then ordering a drink here. \n\nSit at the bar if there's room, if not go somewhere else!!!\n\nSitting at the table is the worst idea we ever had. It took almost 20 mins for our waitress, Samantha, to bring out bottles of water and a black coffee. And she forgot 1 bottle of water. So, she had to go back for that one. AND she had our credit card so we couldn't even get up and leave! \n\nThen she brought the bill, looked over my friend's shoulder as she signed and tipped her (which is the absolute worst), then collected the receipt.  Then 5 mins later came back and asked us if she got our signed bill. Bang head on wall. \n\nHoly he11 it was awful! \n\nWe were staying there for a convention and were going to have cocktail meetings there. BUT after the first one we quickly changed venues. \n\nSTAY AWAY!"
1,Best...coffee...ever!
0,"Sushi rolls were relatively small and overpriced. Nothing too special about them either. Very slow service. Just nothing special about the place-- of course, sushi in Madison is pretty tough to come by, so perhaps I just need to lower my expectations."
0,"I've gone to this place a couple of times over the last month or so, and unfortunately it wasn't as good of an experience as it should have been.  I really like the lady with the Italian accent, she's been great to deal with.  However, there's two other employees that weren't too eager to help and didn't seem to be so excited to be there. \n\nI don't know anything about tailoring, altering, sewing, needles, etc. so that's why when I go there, I expect to talk to someone that does know, and when they're not very helpful, it makes me scratch my head and not want to come back."
0,"The cold weather was killing my battery performance.  Like the car is sputtering and the battery does not have enough juice to turn the engine on.  I felt so helpless with the prospect of potentially being stranded somewhere or not being able to get to work.  So I ordered a replacement battery, and decided to head to Walmart and have their auto service department install the battery for $10 (that's what their website stated as one of the services offered).\n\nSo with a really deep saving on a premium battery I ordered online, I drove to Walmart Supercenter.  But the auto service department said they don't install batteries unless it was purchased from Walmart.  WTF?  Do I need to print out the Walmart webite and show you what services you do offer?\n\nAnyway, nothing was done, so I did the dirty work myself and saved the $10.\n\nNot a happy camper, but getting your hands dirty and doing something on your own is noticeably rewarding.  Not looking forward to it, but I know I can do it if I wanted to.\n\n2 stars!"
1,"I'm not a big burger person, but I like how they make your burger to order. I love how they let you pick your toppings..a big plus for us. Their fries are amazing! Love the seasonings that they put on them. We always order the small fries and share as they give you so much!! \n\nThis location is always so clean. Bathrooms are also clean and well stocked. Tables clean, and when someone leaves, one of the workers comes over and wipes it down."
1,First time visit today. Had the tenderloin tips with hummus and lentil soup. Soup was very good. Tips and hummus just blew me away.  I will be back
1,"finally checked this place out tonight (a monday) and I have to say, I was impressed. we were seated immediately and our waiter was super attentive. I might wait to go back until it cools down a little as they don't have a/c, but you really can't beat $16 for a great pizza and a pitcher... not to mention interesting atmosphere and good music playing."
1,"We went to Blanco on a Saturday around 11:30 for lunch. The place was jam packed! If it isn't a scorcher outside, find a shady spot on the patio- the cushioned patio furniture is super comfy and the misters make the heat a little more tolerable. \n\nDefinitely have the guacamole! It's fresh and flavorful and a good accompaniment to the chips and salsa. The cheese crisps are a must- kind of a Mexican flatbread the size of a medium pizza. The street tacos were good- tiny, but good! Several unique drink options are on the menu. The mixed berry marg seemed to be the crowd favorite. Give Blanco a shot if you're in the mood for Mexican!"
0,"knowledge of the people in this store is hit or miss...\n\nI stopped in because my pool motor is making a racket.  I had a picture of the label, showed them it's a 3/4 hp motor.  it either needs a rebuild or replacement\n\nthey don't do rebuilds, so I ask for a price on a replacement.  the guy brings out a 2 hp motor... and quotes me something like $450.   he was pretty clueless, asking me what type of motor I wanted.  umm... I showed you what I've got, why wouldn't you be able to tell me what I need to replace it?  I sure don't need a 2hp motor to replace a 3/4 hp.\n\nI know two-speed motors can be used in place of my single-speed and they're more efficient, so I ask him about that.  He has to call a guy at another store to figure out what I need and how much it is.\n\nlike I said, hit or miss..."
1,Yum off the charts. I was moaning from their shredded beef  tacos. Some of the best I have ever had and I am surrounded by mexican joints.\n\nPrices were reasonable especially for the higher end drinks.\n\nThe location near the art galleries makes for a perfect date night. It is also super charming inside and on the patio.\n\nThis will be my Scottsdale go to place.\n\nAm so jealous of the locales that they get this place in their hood!
0,"Insultingly small portions for the price. I have no problem with limiting portion size and focusing on detail (in fact, I prefer it to the ridiculously oversized portions that most restaurants pile in front of you), but this went far beyond a point of ridiculousness - I felt like I was eating at the snooty restaurant archetype found only in comedy films. I was served 6-8 ounces of a very light and simple pasta and paid at least $20 for the privilege. It didn't even contain any meat. I easily could have taken my money across the street and gotten a couple porterhouses for the price I paid for dinner for two here. I left this place hungry and poor, and therefore won't be repeating that mistake."
0,"I came here just for a haircut. My hair was long, and damaged, hadn't had it cut for awhile. Nevertheless, I had enough to work with. I don't speak French, nevertheless, I said I wanted the dry ends removed and some layers. Pretty standard request. She started cutting from the top and cut it reeeeally short. Then it seemed by the end she realized that it was too short and left the last section at the back long. So now it's like I have a bob with some ratty long ends at the back. My hair is thin, even though I have lots of it, but now all the thickness is in the short hair. Plus it's not even cut evenly anywhere. Looks ridiculous. I will need to style it myself to see if I can fix it. It's not even long enough to stick properly into a ponytail anymore. While she was cutting I could see how much she had snipped off and started thinking to myself, about how long it would take to grow back. My estimation is 1.5 years. She asked if I was ok at this point, obviously seeing the look of despair on my face. I went on a Thursday evening... which is double the price, I thought since they weren't students? I think I thought wrong, save yourself the tears and go somewhere else. And by the way, I waited a week for this appointment.\n\nOn a side note, they did my boyfriend's hair too. For some reason didn't use clippers, didn't bother to clean up the back of his neck and didn't take enough off. It also took about 30 minutes longer than mine. He's not too happy either but atleast his is fixable."
0,Thumbs down. Service is terrible!
0,"This Walmart blew the opportunity to redeem the repeated failure of a product, for which I did not happen to have the receipt when I decided to stop and take care of it. Customer Service Manager Chelsea is clearly empowered to read the return policy on the wall. Of course, I am, too. The purpose of requesting to speak to a manager was to gain the exception that those in such a position are typically able to dispense. \n\nMy request? Please allow me to upgrade to a higher quality item since the original lasted less than a month and the first replacement only a week. We are talking $12.88 here. She suggested that I go to a larger store that has different parameters for returns. I suggested that I shop at Target. Customer Service Manager Chelsea was good with that."
1,This isn't a Mediterranean place per se. I'm actually not really sure what it is. We'll call it a smorgasbord of lunch goodies. It's a cute place and I've been in for lunch a few times. It's not anything to write home about but  I enjoyed it. A reasonably priced place if you're looking for a quick bite.
0,"I had the ceviche with all onions, and my bfs burrito was average at best. Not worth it. Don't go here."
0,"This specific location, service was poor, establishment was dirty, carpets looked dingy.  Not appealing. They need to make some significant changes."
0,"Super average experience... Maybe I am too picky.\n\n(-) As huge fans of microbrews, every time we visit a new city we make a point to visit a brew pub and bring home a growler. After an entirely underwhelming experience at Great Dane, we actually sought out another brewery to bring loot home from. Try Ale Asylum instead. \n\n(-) Food was meh. Tuna tataki was over-cooked (If it's sushi grade, it should be barely seared!), wings were good (the homemade Gorgonzola sauce was the best part of the meal), and tandoori chicken was a confusing Indian/Mediterranean fusion.\n\n(+/-) Service was good although our server seemed a bit green, fumbling to remember the special brews. \n\n(+/-) The scotch ale was pretty decent but the rest of the beer flight was completely unmemorable. \n\n(+) The best part of Great Dane is their courtyard, outdoor seating."
0,"I know this is probably heresy but I have one word to sum up the crown and anchor: Meh.\n\nI think to enjoy this place you need to be  A) in college and B) have never been to any other pub. Ever.\n\nFirst off, I expect a pub to serve more than just beer and wine at the bar. To get hard alcohol (ie. Whiskey in my case) you have to sit in the dining area and order food.  Someone cheaped out on a real liquor license and just doesn't care at this point.\n\nSecond, the fish + chips I've tried twice here and its completely lackluster. Not worth the hype. It tastes frozen. The chips were mealy, both times. Very middle of the road. Maybe they had a better chef or food distributor a while back when it got voted #1 in Vegas, but there's far better elsewhere.\n\nThe jukebox was a little bit crap too. I heard the Police greatest hits for a little too long. Then it was followed by 1990's euro trash techno. Very blah.\n\nOn the upside: great atmosphere, great room, nice pool tables. If you're a major beer drinker, then you'll love it. The whiskey drinker in me was disappointed by their liquor policy."
1,"I went here with a friend during Restaurant Week. We ate lunch in the stable and not the main house (or whatever they call it). I think the main house is for dinner only, but I could be making that up. We shared the burger and the fried fish. I was absolutely blown away. After basking in the golden glow of this exquisite beer-battered fish soaked in malt vinegar (because how else would you do it?!), I had some of the burger. Any burger with barbecue sauce and onion rings on it is sure to be good, but this one was phenomenal. They make the barbecue sauce in-house (as well as everything else, far as I can tell) and lay it on thick. Dessert was a blur of sugary bliss. Their turtle pie is amazing!\n\nIf you haven't been to Quivey's, I strongly encourage you to go because it's really a gem."
0,"This place will rip you off and I'm sure they're not really animal lovers. I've used this vet for years, and have never really been that impressed. This last visit was the one to make me write a review. I took my dog there because she was sick, they checked her out, gave her a couple pills and said there ya go. They didn't even thoroughly examine her. Next day, she's getting worse. I love my dog and will spend and do whatever necessary to keep her happy and healthy. However, it feels as though they just do the bare minimum so you have to come back to keep paying. Did I mention how scared she gets when she sees on vet in particular? What did you do to my girl?"
0,"PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.  Once they have your credit card and deposit, they will ignore you and not return your call.  I left over 10 messages and emails because they were late to pick up my car 1 week.  I had to pay storage fees of over $200.  Maria (the owner) answers the phone and pretends she is not Maria.  Several times she did this and did not forward my messages. After calling maria with a blocked caller id, she picks up the phone and plays dumb about being late.  When you confront her, she will curse and go crazy.  She is the biggest liar i have dealt with and not very stable.  If you want to save yourself time, the headache and stress, please use a different company."
1,"It's a bit expensive and often crowded, and the booze can be low-quality (they recently switched from Beefeater to New Amsterdam as their well gin). Now that that's out of the way, the praise:\n\nOh man, is the decor great. This place has wonderful ambiance, with great service and fantastic staff. The food's only okay (I liked the chicken quesadila but not a lot), but it's pretty cheap and, honestly, you don't come to Boltini for the food. You come for the cocktails. The martinis are great, and if you don't like vodka martinis, there are plenty of great drinks on the menu (personally, I get dirty martinis and Old Fashioned when I don't want to drink sugary stuff). The bar is gorgeous, and they almost always have some sort of music, whether it's a live DJ or a guy and a keyboard (okay, that's not always the best sort of thing). \n\nThe specials are also fantastic; Wednesdays feature half-price cocktails, and Thursdays feature half price martinis. While I wish they'd tell me what qualifies as a \""martini,\"" I'm not going to complain. $15 can get you three really good drinks and a very strong buzz."
1,"5 stars for the friendliness and politeness of the staff. Their product in not bad at all, either. I had the double choc mocha and it was very good. \n\nWill be back here everyday."
1,"Sooooooooo there's a little bit of beer here. And by \""little bit\"" I mean a $#!% ton! I don't think I've ever seen so many different varieties under one roof, so much so it was near impossible to settle on the two brews that I grabbed... Moon Man and a New Glarus first for me, Enigma. They call it a sour, but I've had sourer (is that really a word?) It's tasty! Sweet almost cherry-like notes, but what do I know... I just started drinking beer yesterday. \n\nThe liquor aisles will take you days to navigate. Let me make it easy. Three Olives S'mores Vodka. It's all you need. It's best shaken with ice and strained, but you can do pretty much anything with it. We had some eager drinkers (read: drunk ass mo fos) over to the house who discovered that you can add anything right down to tonic and it'll probably still be delish. \n\nAs for foodstuffs, I can't say much because I haven't shopped those aisles. \n\nCarry cash, check or your debit though. Visa isn't everywhere you want to be."
0,"Been to this clinic before and it was fine.  Today was the worst experience, that I had to leave.  When I got there I was the only patient to be seen.  Waited ten minutes, then was taken to the back and put in the room.  Was told I couldn't leave the door open even though it was extremely hot because of the hepa law.  Fine if the office had other patients but I was the only one there.  The doctor was no where to be found.  So now it's 15 minutes and I move to the outside waiting room since I am on oxygen and need to be in a cool area.  The doctor still no where to be seen, so after 45 minute wait I left without seeing anyone.  So if you don't mind waiting forever even when no is there this place is for you."
1,"Good place for seafood restaurant. You go there and choose what are you like and then they cook for you with some spices.\n\nPlace look good, I went there with my girlfriend. They give good portion of side dishes too like potato or rice.\n\nI ordered a grilled fish, and I liked it pretty good. My girlfriend ordered grilled salmon and also not bad.\n\nIf you are a seafood lover, you should try this place. \n\nTheir seafood look fresh ok when you order."
1,"I love this place. I come here every time I'm in Vegas. There's a great view of the fountains and it's always great weather. So why not?\n\nAnyway, the food is always delicious and service is spot on. We got some eggs benedict and .. I can't remember what everyone else had but .. YUMMY! The lunch here is great too. \n\nOne thing is that while being my birthday breakfast, I wish that they had something special for those occasions. But aside from that? I'm a fan."
0,"I would recommend you the potatoes soup or clam chowder they are awesome... services is ok, kind of slow during lunch time"
0,"Currently sitting at a table at Coca Cafe after an 1 hr and a half wait. A wait in which we were initially told it would be 25 minutes. After 45 mins we went in to ask the waitstaff and were told that 5 more tables were ahead of us! After another 45 mins we ask what's going on and they said they called us and apparently someone told them we were on our way and never showed up. Anyways, they were able to seat us 10 mins later. Luckily we knew what we wanted ahead of time and put in our omelette orders and coffee. 10 mins go by and the coffee wasn't there. We ask the waitress for the coffee and she said \""didn't I bring you your coffee\"" No you didn't or else the coffee cups would be on the table! \n\nWaiting for our food now. I'll finish my review after...\n\nWe got our food and it turns out the Salmon Omelette and Avocado Omelette with toast was very good.  Unfortunately the poor service ruined what would have been a restaurant I would suggest friends go to.\n\nI really only gave it 2 stars or maybe even 2.5 stars because of the very good food... the restaurant itself gets less than 2 stars.\n\nNote to Coca Cafe: Please learn to run an efficient restaurant operation.  Thank you."
1,"I live here. Seriously, I do. Whenever I go to the mall, I'm completely absorbed in Hello Kitty and all her cute, little friends. I'll be there for hours on end until someone comes to pull me out or I've looked at everything at least seven times.\nIt's a little expensive, but bear in mind that lots of this stuff is from Japan and is pretty much only available at other specialty stores.\nIf you plan on moving into this magical shopping Wonderland as have I, prepare to be on cloud 10."
1,"Thank you Yelp. Not for introducing me to another good restaurant, but for introducing me to new friends who introduced me to a good restaurant. I tend to not be the most available individual, but Robyn and Kevin L. have been very patient with me. After a few failed get together attempts, we finally met at Frank and Fina's for dinner. \n\nI have had this on my bookmarks for a few months and was happy to try something new. Of course I fell victim to the infamous Sweet Potato Enchiladas ($10.25) and a Margarita on the rocks with salt ($5.75). Two nice size tortilla rolls filled with mashed sweet potatoes caught me off guard with the natural candy like flavor. After a few more bites, I adjusted, and they were delicious. I was also able to taste Robyn's Guacamole and Kevin's Queso Fundido. Both were good. The first might be bland for some, but I could eat a whole guacamole with nothing else, so that did not bother me. The cheese dip was fantastic. Served with soft flour tortillas, you will need more to get all of the melty goodness. It would be a sin to waste any,\n\nIf a good meal is not enough, bring some friends along because it is a chill atmosphere. Throughout dinner, we were checked upon, but it did not interfere with conversation. The quiet setting is perfect for dates or catching up."
1,"Always great food and great atmosphere! Love the potatoes, the oysters - actually everything on the menu is good. You cannot go wrong!"
1,"Amazing menu, exceptional staff, unique atmosphere....Chelsea's exceeds all expectations!  One of my top five restaurants. Ever. The restaurant reminds me of Houston's, but done MUCH better. \n\nIt's intimate, yet spacious. Classy, but not overdone. It's ideal. \n\nThe. food. is. PHENOMINAL. The menu is tied together with seafood and some Mexican dishes. In the spotlight are the tacos.  Two words:  shortrib tacos. HUGE portion of perfectly seasoned meat, guac, pico de gallo, rice and beans, with house-made tortillas on the side. You must try them!\n\nPrior to this, my date and I were enjoying the shrimp ceviche when we see a picturesque plate of nachos presented to another table. Food envy. Yes, we are definitely coming back to sit on the patio and enjoy a gigantic plate!\n\nI have never encountered such genuine, knowledgeable and charismatic waitstaff. I glanced over where food is prepared and I noticed each waiter carefully wiping off any splashes or splatters of foodage from each plate. This is food at it's full potential."
1,"Who isn't in the market for a pair of Levis 511's these day? (Ahem, skinny jeans, to the lay jean wearer) The Levis Outlet in Concord Mills Mall is a hipster haven and the premier place to score denim gold. \n\nFirst, you're dealing with Concord FREAKING Mills, so park where you're comfortable. The store is located on the backside of the mall and is most likely easiest to access near Burlington Coat Factory or Bass Pro. Just a little FYI. \n\nYou'll always find a ton of items on sale and on even more of a super sale. Every time I've gone in to buy a pair of jeans, I've never paid more than $35 a pair. Tons of other denim/trendy fashion mise en place. Hats, belts, scarves, wallets, ninja stars (not really). Everything but the kitchen sink. Can't go wrong if you're looking to score a plaid shirt, fedora and new pair of skinny jeans. \n\nThe staff here is always on their toes. Never will there be a second where you'll feel lost. Always prompting you with sizes, recommendations and direction on where to go/find what you need/want. Knowledgeable dudes and dudettes. They may come off as \""pushy\"" at times, so be prepared. \n\nThis is the only place I'll buy Levis. Though a hike up I-85, worth the savings and kickass jeans every time."
0,"If you are ok. It is good. If you are  not, you could die before you get proper help.Takes 20-40 minutes to get them on the phone. And appointments, it takes weeks and weeks, If you are in pain forget it.  They have too many clients, and too few providers.\nBetter you try another service.  They are so bad. Today I fi"
0,"The lady in the office was not helpful at all and didn't even seem to understand anything including the English language. I made a reservation ahead of time online through OneStopParking for parking at Sundance. The woman said they had no record of my reservation - after she asked for my name several times which is an easy name, nonetheless, she could have just asked me for my ID instead of asking for my name almost 5 times. Then she asked me to email her my reservation which I did and she kept asking me what my rate was. I had a receipt that said I would owe $32 total for my parking fee. Plus side is the shuttle drivers know what they are doing and are very convenient. When I checked out, they said I owed $42 which is $10 more than the prepaid parking I had arranged = and no, I did not use any additional time = my flights were on time and I actually had my car parked there less time than I had booked for myself at the $32 rate. Very disappointed with this company, I hope they either get their act together or go out of business. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS when I asked them to refund my $10. Thanks a ton stupid parking Nazis."
1,"Love the food. Love the staff. Hate the wait. Only solution for us is to try to hit it at an off time. Good luck. The bacon is superb and the rosemary potatoes are a can't miss. Everything else, including the vaunted pork chops, are good, but hardly off the chart. I get the charm thing, but it's breakfast and I'm hungry. Find me a seat."
1,"the root beer is worth six stars, the food, worth four, the fact that they won't let me eat my lunch while sitting on the John Deere- one.  overall a nice four. let me sit on the tractor next time, and I'll bump it to five."
1,"Really a nice little find. Four stars for the gyro dinner, veggie plate and greek salad. They were all really good and the price is definitely right. i will definitely be back here again!"
0,Food is average at best.  But last two times the service was terrible.  They need to retrain their servers in customer service.  The only reason for the 2 stars is that there is no denying that their cheesecake is excellent.
1,"This review is not a hamburger review.  Been there twice and ordered sandwiches both times.\n\nI was very impressed with the friendly service, even after we were seated-as this place is not a wait-service style restaurant.  Food was quick and very fresh.  Once I ordered the Tri-Tip Sandwich on grilled sourdough.  It was excellent!  Tender, flavorful meat.  Second time I ordered the Chicken Club. Nothing spectacular but it was done well.  Sad to say the sweet potato fries were a major disappointment.  Literally zero flavor.  The onion rings were tasty, though.\n\nNo, this place does not replace In-n-Out and doesn't even compare in my opinion.  But still a great place to go if you want something fresh and new."
1,"I came here last night with my boyfriend to meet up with a couple of friends and I was really really impressed with the place.  Not only do they have an inviting atmosphere with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating but their food is as good, if not better than what I had heard.  \n\nThe interior has a casual ambiance with local artists' paintings as decor.  An open kitchen, so that you can see your food being prepared and a friendly staff to boot.\n\nUpon sitting down you get a basket of their housemade tortilla chips and salsa (also made in house).  Make sure to ask for the spicy salsa too....you won't regret it (although, I thought it could be a little spicier).  \n\nThe menu is simple but filled with flavorful options.  I was torn between the quinoa vegan salad or the cactus tacos.  I chose the cactus tacos but did it without cheese.  I couldn't believe the flavor inside those little corn tortillas (which had a ton of flavor themselves).  They come small, so I recommend getting a few of them to start.\n\nMy boyfriend got the steak, pork belly, and chicken tacos.  I pretty much think he was in heaven.  He said his favorite was the pork belly and the steak.\n\nWe will definitely be back to try the quinoa salad and also because I heard they were going to be opening for brunch soon and I love my brunch...especially mimosas!   \n\nAll in all, you'd be doing yourself a favor to coming to Paz...can't wait to see what is to come!"
0,"Count your change, and look at your receipt. I had been going regularly, and last week I was hungry, hurried and distracted. Later whenI looked at my receipt I saw I had been clearly shortchanged by the counter-lady. Doubt if I'll return. Or if I do, I'll bring the exact amount. Their burritos are only okay, the ingredients tend to be clumped at one end or the other. Who wants a big wad of guac at the end of the burrito? Anyway, the place reminded me of the cool burrito places I used to go to in SF Mission and I prefer to avoid big chains. Not sure where I'll go now."
0,"This place was just not good, that's all there is to it.  I waited for 30 minutes on a very slow Monday afternoon, and their thoughts were to stick me at a chair and let my feet soak.  Lukewarm water ten minutes into the waiting, I knew this was a lost cause.  The place was not inviting, I thought the interior was very tacky, trying way too hard.  Pedicure was rough, not hurtful, just not gentle and very rushed.  Manicure same thing, very very rushed.  I only tipped because I'm a decent person but if I didn't have a soul I would have considered not tipping at all.  Save your time, go somewhere else."
1,"The reviews complaining about no view, or no restaurant, or no pampering, apparently did ZERO research before booking. Jockey Club is a non-casino hotel, somehow wedged between Bellagio and Cosmo. Jockey Club was here long before either of those interlopers, and for whatever reason neither developer bought the property. So whats left is a small, condo hotel.\n\nRooms are within closer walking distance to the strip than either hotel mentioned above. Dedicated parking and elevator is in the Cosmo garage. Every room has a FULL kitchen - range, oven, microwave, fridge freezer, coffee maker, dishwasher. Dining area, Walk in closet.  Separate living/sleeping areas. I challenge you to find that elsewhere on the strip, especially at a comparable rate.\n\nI never even saw a timeshare sales rep.\n\nMy room was spotless, cleaned and restocked daily, and absolutely perfect. Mind you, I've spend countless nights in LV at the Trump and Elara, plus forays to Mandalay and Mirage. I know whereof I speak. Elara and Trump offer the full suite experience, but were too pricey for this trip. The other strip casino hotels you get zero amenities in the room unless you book super premium suites, not even coffee.\n\nBiggest drawback is lack of view and full service. If your thing is sitting in a hotel room looking at a view of the strip, having your every need catered to, then this is not your place. But if you can lay in some groceries, don't plan to spend hours in your room gazing at the view, and can walk a hundred feet to the Cosmo for food and fun, stay here."
0,"A hotel well past its prime. It needs a major face lift. It has the feel of an old Holiday Inn, but it's a Hilton. \n\nThe construction is shoddy. The hallway floor changes levels. You can see the joists of the outer walls of the hotel in the elevator lobbies. CLASSY, lemme tell ya. The entire place has that musty hotel smell (I noticed in Las Vegas there are two classes of hotel, those that smell like hotels, and those that don't). The rugs are shoddy. It's far away from everything on the strip. The buffet is GAWD AWFUL.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that whole back wing of the hotel is depressing. The lighting is bad old age home commissary-cum-trailer park/truck stop/diner.  You will be surprised to find that Ken-LRation is not on the menu. It just tastes like  it.\n\nAvoid this hotel unless none of the above bothers you. \n\nOh, and they fleece you left and right. $14.99 PER DAY for wireless with no option for cheaper multi-day plan. \n\nThe more I think about this place, the angrier I get.  STAY AWAY. Two stars is generous."
0,We always go to the Pub on Eastern in Henderson. The food is usually great but at this one it sucks! We ordered 3 steak specials all rare. Each one came out different. One was so raw it didn't even have grill marks on it. We had to wait 20 mins for drink refills. I wouldn't suggest this location to anyone.
1,"I was glad to see something delicious with speedy service at The Plaza and even more impressed with the Vegan Pizza.  I loved the vegetables which seemed fresh along with tangy sauce, the cheese was cheesy despite not being dairy.  What I really enjoyed was having a couple of great tasting slices that wasn't super heavy given the thin yet delicious crust.  \n\nIf you're in the area and looking for a quick bite that gets you a fast yet delicious lunch then you owe it to yourself to stop.  I'm looking forward to trying more slices."
1,"Simply one of the best places in Maricopa to go for Mexican. Sure, the waitstaff gets a little cranky; but, they work hard and keep the place clean. \n\nI've had breakfast lunch and dinner here. Food is solid, always consistently good and the price is right! \n\nSo glad they moved from their old location! \n\nKudos to Tacos N' More!"
1,"My coworker and I were in Scottsdale for a conference and didn't want to stay at the mixer that night so we went to Old Scottsdale to look for a restaurant to eat.\n\nItalian Grotto was dark and crowded...it must be good.\n\nThe restaurant had a great garlic smell to it...I know why. It's the delicious garlic toast! The garlic toast had real diced chunks of garlic on top of the grilled bread! SO freaking awesome.\n\nThe Caesar salad was also the bomb because they add in anchovies...yum! \n\nOur server was great too...bubbly and energetic. \n\nWhat I didn't like too much about this place is the lack of pasta options. It was mainly ravioli, cannelloni, and lasagna."
1,"Awesome tortillas, awesome salsa, pretty good selection of Latin American food products (mostly Mexican, but lots of S./Central American and Caribbean).  I'm spoiled from all the Hispanic grocery stores in Atlanta, but this is the best one I've found in the 'burgh.  Prices are average for the Strip and Pittsburgh, but a little high for a Hispanic grocery store."
1,"Lili is a new fave for my \""caffeinated lunch\"" fix. Great little selection of sandwiches - I love the vegan Banh Mi(!) and the tempeh reuben is good too. Sandwiches come with pickles on the side; major plus! They play excellent music (I wouldn't expect anything less with Mind Cure up above to curate the selections) and the shop is generally hip, but not in an exclusive way. Rather, it exudes a rad community vibe that you will either want to be a part of or feel repelled by because of your inability to feel comfortable in a genuinely cool place. Disclaimer: nobody is going to befriend you just for walking in the door and you might get a sunburn if you sit on the patio on a sunny day."
0,"A reasonable place for decent food at a cheap price. Something about the ambiance of the place puts me off though. This place is more of a quick lunch place so it shouldnt really matter how nice the place is or not - but the dreary atmosphere discourages me to go here. The person running the place is somewhat cold and rude, thats something I rather avoid."
1,"This was our first Cirque show in Las Vegas, despite half a dozen trips to the Strip in the last couple years.  We'd read up on reviews beforehand so we knew that this was more a Broadway style show than a straight Cirque show.  So we didn't enter the theater with any illusions.\n\nEarlier in the day as we purchased our tickets at the Box Office, we were given 2-for-1 drink coupons in the nearby Gold Lounge.  Before the show, we stopped in to redeem them...but that's another review.\n\nThe theater is decently sized with comfy overstuffed chairs and drink holders.  Our seats were row W, along the side center walkway.  As a previous review noted, the show is very center stage oriented so we were glad we hadn't gone with the along-the-wall seats on the main floor.  We would have been closer to the stage but our view would have been skewed.\n\nBefore the show started, about ten of the performers wandered the ground floor aisles entertaining audience members.\n\nThe show itself is definitely Broadway-styled.  A single Elvis impersonator never appears but rather, they have woven pictures, videos, home movies & Elvis-inspired performers throughout the acts.  Slower songs had split vocals with four excellent live female singers.  They had amazing voices & we really enjoyed them.  The live band is fabulous as well - the drummer is a hoot!  That guy had boundless energy and was always moving for the entire 90 minute show.\n\nThe song arrangements are fun & very modern.  Lots of pounding bass & dance beats layered over everything.  We liked it so much we purchased the show cd afterwards.  Kudos to them for updating Elvis' \nmusic and keeping it contemporary.\n\nThe acrobatic acts are interspersed with the musical/dance numbers.  For the price of the tickets, we were really expecting a little more Cirque and a little less Broadway.  That being said, the acts that were included were very entertaining.  They have a multi-trampoline act that was a riot.  I swear the guys were monkeys flying around.  Each act is themed around a specific song or period in the life of Elvis...we were really wondering just how they'd incorporate the French-Canadian circus performers with the hillbilly King of Rock n Roll.  While some of them are a little tenuous, they did their best to keep the flow going.\n\nWe noticed a fair amount of empty seats in the balcony, so don't pay full price for the tickets anywhere.  They have them on sale in multiple locations including the discount ticket centers on the Strip and also online in a $100 for two ticket deal."
0,"A huge disappointment.  A friend who works in the Arizona Center took us to 1130.  I ordered a \""Black and Bleu Burger\"" medium.  Was told there's a choice of fries or slaw... asked if I could get both... told no.  ?? How hard would it be to arrange that?  The burger came... way overcooked... with a tiny smear (about the diameter of a fifty-cent piece) of what might have been blue cheese.  When our server finally appeared, she asked \""How is everything?\""... I told her what the problem was... she smiled and walked away, never having offered any solution to the problem.  I will say the iced tea was good."
0,"Quick background: Asian guy who loves sushi in Phoenix for the Dodgers Spring Training. \n\nI was weary of venturing into Giants' territory (Scottsdale) for sushi of all things. But upon yelping the entire city for a half decent Japanese restaurant... our group was directed to Dozo. Big mistake in trusting the \""star-rating\"" over the actual reviews; will explain.\n\nFirst impression:::::\nWe walk into Dozo which is located a few blocks from the Giants' Spring Training facility and inside of a plaza with a TJ Maxx. The restaurant was dark and about 75% of the tables were occupied. Good so far. We get seated right away. No Giants' fans to be spotted, even better.\n\nMenu::::::\n Nothing out of the ordinary. You got your rolls found in every Japanese restaurant; your California Rolls, your Spider rolls, nigari etc. etc. They also have bento boxes @ $11 and up. \n\n:::::::::We ordered 3 specialty rolls and 3 orders of Nigiri to start off almost as soon as we were handed the menu. You would assume placing your order means that you get your food shortly right? Nope. Begin the clock. With nothing to do besides talk and drink the water we were given. Minutes fly by and before I knew it, it was already 40 minutes after our order and a group of 10 Giants fans walk in. As I curse quietly to myself I log onto my Yelp app to actually read reviews about the place. At this point it is more than 45 minutes after we ordered and I stumble upon Jamie M.'s review where she mentioned that it took the the staff over 35 minutes for them to inform her that something she ordered was unavailable. As I read it to my group we are FINALLY served after 50 minutes. \n\nFood:::::\nSpider roll: Made of 6 average sized pieces of sushi (costed $12.50 btw). The fried soft shell crab was missing a key ingredient... the soft shell crab. Also this roll was poorly rolled... by that I mean just using my chop sticks to even attempt to place it in my mouth was a chore. The rice was not even sticking to the sushi \""filling\"" and was breaking apart before I even got to chew it. I was too hungry to really complain I just ate 2 pieces and onto the next.\n\nSalmon/Albacore Nigiri: Each piece was about 2\""x1\"" inches and the fish was wafer thin. Not worth it.\n\nFour Seasons Roll: Another $12 roll. The roll was so unmemorable I don't even recall what was in it.  Would I again pay $12 for this? You probably already know the answer.\n\nRed Dragon Roll: ..... I would review this if we actually got to eat it. Back to Jamie M's review. It is now 55 minutes after we ordered. And after indiscriminately devouring what we were finally served... the waitress trouts out and says basically, \""Oh hey, remember that Red Dragon Roll? We don't have any more soft shell crab. Would you like to get the Eel instead?\""  I have no ill feelings towards her but we were pretty pissed off. You know when you hear of someone's bad experience that you hope it doesn't happen to you as well? Yup, happened to us.\n\n::: Back to those pesky Giants' fans. I watched them get their drinks about half an hour and their edamame about 40 minutes after ordering. In fact, as they smugly smiled at us walking out they STILL did not get any actual food yet.  It's already been a few days and I bet they're still sitting around.  Now under any normal circumstances, I would not feel bad for a Giants' fan, but this might have been the one time...... NOT. \n\nObservations:::::::::::::::\n\n1) After we ordered I looked around at all the other tables. Of the 5 tables in our area, only ONE table had food. \n\n2) The majority of the positive reviews for Dozo are from a really long time ago and/or are not even relevant to food or the service(re: Jon P's \""review\""). I can only assume that the quality of food and service has taken a steep decline in the past few years.\n\n3) The sushi \""chef\"" could be heard running his mouth throughout the entire restaurant. I guess he forgot that he's supposed to actually do his job and I don't know... feed the customers who walk into the establishment? \n\n4) When you hear that this place is the \""best\"" sushi in all of PHOENIX, you should be wary of the reviews.\n\nConclusion::::::::\nIf you are a Giants' fan, this restaurant is perfect for you and you should definitely give them your business. Just kidding. This place is terrible and the only thing I enjoyed here was the water. No really. It didn't even taste like tap water. If you're from out of town, you would be better suited to get another kind of cuisine. If you're a local, definitely don't come here for sushi. There's got to be somewhere better than this."
1,"Thoroughly enjoyed my night here tonight! Right when we walked in it was super packed. We couldn't find our own seat in the bar area so moved on to the dining area for 8 people. The zipparita is actually very good for the happy hour at only $3. When it says there's a limit on the menu, I knew I would get my money's worth of alcohol.\n\nWhen we ordered food, we got the mild buffalo wings and the chips and guac.... Not a bad wait for both of the items with how busy it was. The buffalo wings in mild were way too bland for me so we had to get a side of medium sauce for the extra kick. For the chips and guac, both very good but had to a season the guac with much more salt and pepper. For the rest of the night it was just more drinks.\n\nFor it being March Madness, I would love to be back here again during this week. A great place to watch games as TVs are absolutely everywhere. Keep up the nice work as a new sports bar on Mill and people will continue to come in! Be back soon!"
1,"FABULOUS CAMBODIAN CUISINE!  \n\nJust like being on an exotic vacation tasting new flavors from top chef pretty platters in almost a Cambodian Museum .\n\nThis small restaurant is easy to miss depending on your direction driving here because the sign is only painted on one side of restaurant . Once you walk in you see a display of Cambodian relics including very old musical instruments , nick nacks  and visitor books on Cambodia on every table .\n\nOur server was very friendly and welcoming and understood we needed a little time to decide . \n\nI decided on the Loc Lak , it was pan fried beef cubes over a salad platter that came with  pickled green papaya and carrot salad , egg roll and steamed white rice . This dish was prettier than I can describe but it was also more tasty than I can describe as well . I tasted unusual flavors I never tasted before that were very good sort of tangy slightly garlic almost a mint flavor but not mint and a lingering honeysuckle note in my throat . The beef was very tender not fatty or oily one bit but it needs to be mentioned that it was a very small portion of beef my guess is two ounces . I also really enjoyed the green papaya carrot salad it was so light and fresh but also spicy , every thing on the platter was very light and fresh and a very nice meal overall .\n\nMy husband had the House Made Beef Sausage platter that also came with steamed rice , egg roll and pickled salad . This platter is a very generous serving of meat you get four sausages that are seasoned in a sweet and sour way and are very good .\n\nWe were EXTREMELY HAPPY with our visit and also spent VERY LITTLE the two meals only cost less than $20 we hope to visit again soon . Also a BYOB"
1,"My review is only based on the appetizers. and drinks during Happy Hour. Having not been here before, my niece recommended the Beef Tenderloin Sliders and the Kettle of Green Chili Pork with hot buttered flour tortillas. Both apps were great but I especially liked the kettle of chili and we ended up ordered a second round of it. Drinks also were great as I had the Citrus Mojito and my niece ordered the Huckleberry Frozen Margarita."
0,"Saw owner opening walmart chocolate chip cookies, and then repackaging them as their cookies, yuck! When they opened their first store it was great, but over the years the flavors have changed and the chicken is bone dry. Any grocery store rotisserre chicken is better. Ordered 1/2 rack ofribs  for $13.49 , they gave me 4 ratty looking ribs. Mashed potatoes are so bland. Gave this new store a chance but, not going back."
1,I love this Pita Jungle better than the one in Tempe for one reason. It's a little more open between tables and it's not so noisy.  Plus only being 5 minutes from my house makes it that much more convenient. Other than that the food is excellent (Stir fried vegetables with noodles and tofu is full of WIN.)  I will definitely eat there as long as it's open there.
1,"Lu Lu's has very affordable and very tasty food that always leaves me stuffed. The service is good, but parking is a pain. A nice bonus is that nearly all entr\u00e9es can be made vegetarian."
1,"What can I say that hasn't been said yet!?!?!!? Came here around 4 with 5 gfs thinking we were coming at an 'off' time... yeah, we were wrong.  Still waiting an hr and 15 mins to get seated.  \n\nFYI- they don't skip people in line if ONE seat opens up and there's a group of 4 next in line.  So don't get upset if you say random seats empty... they're clearing it out for the next GROUP or PERSON in line.   At first we were like... WHYYYY are there open seats.. but then we realized.  \n\nWe told the person that we would take seats of two or three or five-whichever opened up first!  \n\nThe pan roast is AMAZING.  Level 8... I wish I got level 10 but we were sharing.  Ordered the rice on the side so that way all the sauce wouldn't seep into the rice right away- PLUS you can take leftovers to go!  \n\nThe chef and employees are all amazing and super nice!  Can't wait to come back. This definitely will be a must every time I'm in Vegas from here on out.  \n\nActually, my gfs and I are already planning to do a pan roast party at home, SOON!"
0,"From the room comps I had available, I chose Harrahs since they had a superior strip view room. I know it's not the best hotel, but it's central location and having a kickass view seemed awesome.\n\nWell, when I got there they didn't have any ready for another two hours. So I got a mini-suite. It had a partial strip view but mostly of the parking structure. The minibar was empty, there was a very sad and worn couch, sink was runny and shower didn't drain well. That being said, the room was large and laid out well. \n\nThe dealers here are insane. I lost money so fast and it doesn't matter if it's 2 or 5 cards, they will get their 21! Oh well, it was fun I guess? Their drink service at the tables were very prompt, which I loooove!\n\nI will not be back, but I do think it's a decent place for those looking for something central for tourist stuff!"
1,"Hugo's Cellar was the first \""fancy schmancy\"" restaurant that my husband (then boyfriend) tried in Vegas about six years ago. I remember being very impressed by the high class service and the intricately made food. I wondered, was this place good because it was in my pre-Yelp days? Or was it really THAT good? Yes, sir, this place is as good as I remembered.\n\nThis restaurant is in an unlikely location. It's inside Four Queens. Downtown Las Vegas has drastically improved over the last few years but admittedly I still hold my purse close to me when I walk around. I would highly suggest to valet your car because the garage elevator was broken and I had to go down four flights of stairs in heels! Hey, if you're going to a fancy schmancy restaurant, you might as well splurge on valet!\n\nOnce you get to the restaurant, ladies are given a single red rose. The restaurant is dark and has a old school Vegas feel. We were seated in a booth, and I appreciated the romantic ambiance. Waiters were all wearing tuxedos. They even poured water with a certain flair.\n\nMy favorite part about this place is the table side prepared salad. It comes free with your entree and you get an array of toppings to choose from! They give a cute mini raspberry sorbet to cleanse your palette. I ordered the ribeye steak and my husband got the Chilean sea bass. We both savored every single bite and still had leftovers to take home! \n\nI'm not sure if it's because they knew it was our anniversary but we got hooked up with lots of desserts! We got an assortment of chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots to dip in whipped cream. Then we got a chocolate mousse cake that was melt-in-your-mouth amazing! Oh my, my mouth is watering just writing about it.\n\nIf you're looking for romance, good food and great service, you can't go wrong with Hugo's Cellar!"
1,"Fabulous customer service. Awesome vibe. Wonderful staff. Louis, the owner, is fantastic.\n\nGood bartender's and every alcohol manageable. Definitely make this a stop in your Scottsdale vacay"
1,"I've been to Chima's about 10 times now and I always love it! They bring amazing mashed potatoes, fried plantains, yukka fries, beef croquets, mini cheddar biscuits and turkey spread to start with to every table. The salad bar is amazing. If you like blue cheese, get the Gorgonzola mousse and let it melt over a bite of filet or ribeye. YUM! I also enjoy the Gouda, Parmesan and fresh mozzarella cheese from the bar and be sure to get some chimichuri sauce and try it on the flank steak. The vegetable soup is really good and worth a try but save room for the MEAT! When you sit down, turn your \""coin\"" to orange right away. I usually have an extra plate just for meat as I like to keep it separate from my bar items. The first few times I went I tried everything. Now I pass on the chicken and pork and get all the steaks and sausage. If you want a certain meat, just ask for it and they will send it right over! I'm not a big fan of fish, but my friends said the salmon and swordfish were good. If you have room for dessert, the tirimusu is really good. Be sure to tell them if you are celebrating anything, they gave us dessert on the house since it was out anniversary. I give it 4 stars because the service can be too slow or too fast depending on how busy they are. The food is worth it!!"
0,"Avoid this hotel.  The rooms and hallways felt somewhere between cheap dormitory and prison.  Walls are not very soundproof, I heard yelling in the next room until 4 am.  The overall feel is dirty, in spite of the sanitation score listed in the lobby.  Did not feel safe trying the free breakfast, so I have no idea how it was."
1,Service at local was excellent and friendly. The eggs Benedict was amazing and had a nice take with the asparagus and potato pancake addition. Excellent home fries with red peppers and onion. Would definitely recommend and go again.
0,"Outback is better, cheaper, and way less Stuffy.  A restaurant should start to re-examine their quality if they can sit at the last minute on friday or saturday night.  The prices are ridiculous for the quality of the food.  If I pay $50 for a filet minion, I expect for it to knock my socks off.  It was underseasoned and the outer portions were actually dry on a medium cooked steak.  We paid $18 for the mac and cheese, recommended by other yelp reviews, and the mushrooms.  I don't understand how mushrooms could be so bland, and if it was. $25 steak dinner including the mac and cheese that would have been worth it.  The mac and cheese was the most interesting thing we got and it was slightly amusing at best.  Overpriced.... stay far far far far far away from this Stuffy restaurant.  Worst meal in vegas and most expensive."
1,"Very Cool!\n\nDecided to finally stop out at Pgh Winery on a rainy Saturday during one of the wife and I's ritualistic sip and savor tours of the strip.  Decided to drive down as it was a bit of a hike from the main weekend activities around Wholey's.\n\nI'd say the wine itself is average for your typical Western PA buy/import grapes and process establishment, but that's not a bad thing!  (Seemed reasonably priced)\n\nWhere Pgh Winery really shines is down in the basement.  Do yourself a favor, bring some good conversation, but a bottle of wine and go down there when no one else is there.  Sounds odd, but my wife and I had one of the best times taking in the ambiance of the place (walls are lined with wine barrels, tables are wine barrels with lights in them, etc.) and grooving out to whatever Pandora station they had playing at the time (almost positive it was the Beastie Boys).\n\nOn a side note, a coworker had his wedding reception here and had nothing but positive things to say (for those in the market!)."
1,"My annual trip to spoil my taste buds at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon . . . can it get any better? Can this really be better than last year?\n\nOur last night in Vegas, and after dinners at Lotus of Siam, Valentino's, and Nob Hill, we were both looking forward to our dinner here, and getting slightly concerned about potential heart attacks -- which didn't stop us from ordering the foie gras, it just stopped us from ordering their tasting menu . . . \n\nThe amuse bouche was a foie gras parfait with port wine reduction and a Parmigiano-Reggiano foam . . . OMG!\n\nAnd it only got better for there!!!\n\nAgain, with careful scrutiny, bargains CAN be found on the wine list, which is generally stocked with some great wines and your typical \""Vegas Casino markup.\""\n\nBut -- again this year -- L'Atelier was far and away our best meal in Las Vegas . . . stunning."
0,"After trying to get a table at \""The Misson\"" it was suggested we try \""The House,\"" their sister restaurant several blocks away. Wow! What an incredible waste of $200!  The only saving grace was the company of great friends that we hadn't seen in four years.  The atmosphere and service was excellent, which is why I feel it deserves at least one star.  The food? After all the rave reviews I'm thinking maybe the executive chef had the evening off.......\n\nFor starters we shared:\nBerkshire Pork Belly\nDuck Confit Meatballs w/ Foie Gras\nBone Marrow \nWe could have skipped all of these!\n\nDinner:\nLamb Bolognese, ok, but tasted no mint, lemon or marscapone\nSeared Diver Scallops, of which there were three \nRoasted Jidori Chicken, so dry it turned to sawdust in your mouth - yuk!\nBerkshire Pork Ribs, the only thing that was plentiful and tasty (never mind one side of the rib was undercooked!)\n\nAll the fancy buzz words used to describe the dishes on the menu I think were there to impress as almost everything was truly one-dimensional and underwhelming!  The loud overhead, hip-hop music was so inappropriate - you would think in a cozy, romantic, intimate environment the selection would be a little more subdued.\n\nNever again!"
1,"Prices are good, pizza is good, sauce was a bit sweet for my taste but the crust was great, not doughy, high grade cheese...As close as you're going to get to authentic Italian pizza in Las Vegas.  Great customer service, fast, accurate and friendly.  Location is so-so but that goes for most of downtown.  You can park right in front of the place (10 minute parking) or a couple blocks away (parking meters) and walk.  Homeless people may ask you for a slice of pizza on your way back to your car if you choose to walk so if you're not in the giving mood or don't have a sense of humor then you should probably park directly in front just in case."
0,"I'm not even sure where to start.\n\nThe guy at the front desk that checked us in could - seriously - NOT be more apathetic!  I had booked a room in the Pyramid, and without telling me, had \""upgraded\"" us to the West Tower.  Why is \""upgrade\"" in quotes?  Because while the room was definitely a little larger then the Pyramid, it was also 39273287329832872684 miles away from any of the exits to the Strip.  Also - I DIDN'T WANT AN UPGRADE!  I booked the Pyramid room for a reason!!!  ARGH!  But by the time I realized that he already put us in the West Tower, I was too tired (just got off 13hour flight from Taiwan to LAX, and drove 5 hours in LA traffic to get to Vegas at midnight) to argue.\n\nThen when I asked for directions to get to the West Tower, he just pointed at the map on the pad on the counter.  Um, yeah, STILL NO IDEA where the tower was.  UGH.\n\nThen I find out...the Luxor DOES NOT HAVE WIFI!  There are 3 Starbucks in this hotel...and NONE Of them have WiFi.  I'm sorry, is this 2005 or something?!?!?!  The apathetic check-in guy tells me that there are ethernet cables in the room...ummm...doesn't really help me if I have an iPad or an iPhone does it?!?!?!?!\n\nHowever, I will say - the rooms were definitely clean and nice. So I guess that's all that really matters."
0,"Had dinner at the Barrymore this week with my girlfriend and my parents. I had high expectations and also picked the place for the decor, looking v cool on the website. I really wanted to like the place.\nI made a special request for a nicer table as we were celebrating my parents' wedding anniversary - The restaurant called a week before saying they made special arrangements and got us a nice table on the patio. Great! \nWell it turned out that the \""special arrangement\"" was to accomodate a big group that took over the whole room on the night of our reservation. So nothing to do with my request, they just fooled us. \nThe young lady who placed us was obnoxious and unpleasant. On the other hand, our waitress was really nice and helpful. \nI am putting 2 stars as the steaks we got (NY strip and T-bone) were very very good. The 35$ foie gras burger was a total disaster. \nDefinitely not worth the 25$ ride from the strip and freezing on the patio most of the time."
0,"I used to love this place but after my experience last night I'm not sure I'll be returning for awhile. I went to go celebrate my friend's graduation there and ordered a drink and some food. I was excited to see Saffron Jak's pizza there so I ordered the \""Super Greeky\"". After 20 or 30 mins after I ordered I asked the bartender if my pizza was still coming. I saw his eyes get wide and said \""Yes, it's done\"". He brought it over to me and apologized saying the buzzer went off but he didn't hear it and that he wouldn't charge me and to also let him know if I'd like him to make another one. I told him it was ok and that I knew he was busy.\n Well it was super cold but I was so hungry and so were my friends that we ate it anyways.  Plus the pizza was so small it was gone in a matter of seconds; didnt have a chance to speak up and couldn't imagine having to wait another 20+ mins for another! I thought well at least I'm getting that 10 bucks off because it was pretty much cardboard by the time we got it.\nTo my surprise, when I got the bill he had charged me for everything! As he was walking past he saw me analyzing it and asked \""everything look ok?\""  I should have asked about taking the pizza off but he was already at the other end of the bar at that point. I figured since we ate it he assumed nothing was wrong with it. I thought the least he could have done was offer a discount or a comp off of my future orders especially after he forgot about my order and initially insisted that I not pay for it.\nI thought this was very inconsiderate of him and wished I hadn't tipped but then that would have been awkward as I was waiting awhile for my friends to finish their drinks."
1,"Located 215/Gibson - Review from last week in June 2012\nSmall shop in a strip center behind the Speedee mart. \n\nThe shop is plain and very simple. \n\nThey offer about 10 different cupcakes and I've been in a few times and they sure don't overstock. There's some of the same cupcakes each time but sometimes they don't have the ones I'm looking for. The good news is their cupcakes are extremely tasty and moist. Cake batter and cookie dough are fantastic and sweet.\nThey also offer a couple different bars like peanut butter and lemon bars.\nWe got a free cake pop with Yelp check in offer.\nThe need to offer more items for sale and I see they added some bagels but I didn't try and wasn't getting the bagel feel.\n\nGreat cupcakes and they offer 2 for 1 on day old. But don't cheat yourself, get the fresh ones and enjoy! \n\nSuper cupcakes...I definitely recommend and will keep going here."
1,"This was my go-to breakfast / bagel place in Charlotte. The first time one of my friends brought me here, I was pretty skeptical based on the exterior, but once I tried the Grubby Bubby I was hooked. I almost always got the Grubby Bubby with veggie cream cheese and it always hit the spot. I had never had a bagel steamed before Owen's and now I wish I could steam every bagel I eat. Lunch sandwiches are also good here; I always tried to pick a random one from the string of construction-paper sandwiches hung above the counter."
0,"The price is WAY NOT worth it for the type of food we ate. \n\nMind you, this is the second time I ate at Aria and the experience was so dramatically different. My first experience was great and I would have recommended Aria to friends/family despite their lack of variety. However, during my second visit we did NOT experience items that were served during my first dining experience:\n\n-soft-shelled crab (although a bit salty)\n-raw oysters\n-lobster tails (big ones)\n\nThere were at least 4 other people who I heard asking \""Where are the lobsters?\"" including myself. The answer: \""I THINK it is served on Saturday.\"" I mean WTF kind of an answer is that. I don't remember the price we paid but it was probably AT MOST a $4 difference. We paid $36 on Friday.\n\nSummary: To all of you hoping to have lobster tails, go on Saturday. And expect disappointment on any other days....."
0,"Cappuccino Machine was broken, and they lost our order. I went up to the counter where the dude making breakfasts was just standing there looking at tickets and not moving.

0,"Absolutely horrible!!  They were nice when I picked my order up...that's it.  The veggie pizza was soggy as hell...must have used frozen vegetables!  The Caesar's Salad had like a mayonnaise-type dressing...I kid you not, not even CLOSE to what it should taste like.  The dessert, homemade zeppoles, tasted like straight oil.  I mean...how can you F up fried dough?!  This I paid $31 and change...after tip it was $36.00.  Needless to say...I shan't be back!!!"
0,"AVOID THEIR HIGH MEDICATION COSTS AND RELENTLESS UP-SELLING.\n\nAfter a few years of decent experience, my most recent experience is that this \""hospital\"" is focused on up-selling rather than your animals care. My pup is on joint medication and when I found it for much cheaper elsewhere (still expensive!) it was a very painful experience to get a copy of her prescription that I was due. \n\nThey kept stalling for days to provide the prescription, refused to fax or mail it anywhere or speak to the new pharmacy, and continued to try to convince me to \""just buy it from us\"" but failing to match prices. I spoke to the director who sheepishly admitted they are not only in the business for veterinarian service but also for selling medications. I am out-of-state now and had to have someone go pick it up from their office which then took a half-hour for them to figure out how to print it out and once again tried to just sell the medication to my friend! Disgusting.\n\nTrust them? Never again will they see my animal solely for their monetary gain. For shame."
0,"This is my update after giving Jordandal a second try.\n\nThis time round I sampled the nachos with pulled pork which comes with two different salsas and a orange infused sour cream along with the friday night special of pork ribs with bbq beans, slaw, and cornbread. Dessert was a jar of butterscotch pudding.\n\nIt is with great dismay that I can not up-rate my previous scoring of 2 stars.\n\nOnce again I simply did not enjoy the food. I think the chef and I have a very different view on the flavors that jive. I simply thought the sweetness of the pork and flavors of salsa and cream did not compliment each other. The ribs, though fall apart moist, were covered with a dry rub and bbq sauce that I did not care  for and the beans were undercooked and the slaw bland (I could not finish the ribs, beans, or slaw).\n\nI wish Jordandal the very best and encourage folks to give them a try. Perhaps you will like it...? but I can not fairly rate them any higher."
1,"I ate here once while Crudo was still in its Scottsdale location.  And I raved about it and vowed to come back (although the strange location in a salon delayed that return).  Then Crudo disappeared.  And I wondered how a place that fed me one of my best meals in Phoenix could disappear in a town supposedly full of foodies.  Now it has reappeared, and in a better location.  Oh joy."

0,"I would consider myself kind of a frozen yogurt expert, considering I frequented Pinkberry about 3 times a week for a year, and then moved on to Menchies and Yogurtland.  All 3 of which blow Endless Swirls out of the water.\n\nAll of the flavors I tried tasted like they had chemicals in them. I think the staff here needs to re-read the instruction manual or something.  The mix was off for sure.\n\nNot one person in my family, including my 4 & 7 year old finished their yogurt. If two kids won't even finish it because it \""tastes weird\"", then you know something's up.\n\nThe only redeeming factor was that the credit card machine would not swipe my card, and they have no way to take it manually so the nice old lady working there gave it to me for free.  \n\nSo in the end, at least the worst yogurt I've ever tasted was free!"
0,"So I keep reading reviews where people say \""I want to like whatever place, but I just can't.\""  This is how I feel about Harlow's.\n\nThe inside is cool... I like the retro diner feel.  And it's right around the corner from me, so it would be a great convenient spot.  And the prices are decent, except for the fact that the food is just not good.  (In the end I feel like I just wasted $30 on a crappy meal.)  I've given the place two tries, and I just don't get how the rating is so high and why it's always busy.\n\nThe first time I had the eggs benedict.  Not great, but not terrible.  I would never go back for more of that though.  I had read that the eggs Maximilian are the gem on the menu, so when I gave the place another go, I tried it.  Also not good.  My first bite was cold.  Not room temperature cold, but like refrigerator cold.  The flavor is somehow bold and bland at the same time.  I ate about 1/4 of the plate and couldn't do it anymore.  I left the place unsatisfied and kinda hungry.\n\nMy boyfriend likes pretty much everything and is NOT a picky eater, but he didn't like his chorizo breakfast burrito.  I don't know how you can mess  up a breakfast burrito, in AZ nonetheless, to the point that the guy won't eat it, but... well, it happened.\n\nThe OJ tastes like the stuff you get out of a machine at a hotel breakfast.  \n\nYou know you've made a mistake when you know you would have eaten better tasting food at Denny's.  :(\n\nI can't decide between one star or two.  I will never go back there because the food is so bad.  But the service is fine."
0,"Tandoori-Times 2 is a restaurant that has reached a new low among Indian restaurants servicing the Phoenix area. I was there on Friday night last month to pick up lamb biryani that I'd ordered through phone. Having eaten some really good (and bad) biryanis across many states (CA, TX, IL, NC, FL etc.), I didn't expect great things here, especially after seeing the reviews on Yelp. But I still decided to give this place a benefit of doubt. And boy was I in for a rude surprise. The lamb biryani, as this place calls it, consisted of a few boiled lamb pieces thrown into rice that was already mixed with some gravy. It absolutely had no taste, flavor or at least the looks to pass of as biryani; it was simply distasteful.\n\nI was so repulsed with what I got that I felt like going back and asking the cook which fool taught him to make biryani like this. This place rightly deserves all the negative feedback its been getting lately. I've advised all my colleagues and friends never to eat here."
0,"Ugh, stale chips mixed in w/ fresh chips. That's weak. My wife whose gluten intolerant, asked for corn tortillas since it's a taco place and the waitress said all they had was flour tortillas. I ordered the special which had green peppers in the tacos. Since I'm not a fan of green peppers I requested the special w/ out the peppers.  Five mins. later the waitress came back and said the \""chef\"" couldn't take the peppers off my tacos as the special was a \""pre-mix\"". Pre-mix?! It's a damn taco, not French bouillabaisse! Once I heard that I knew I'd never eat here again. The food was decent but I'm not going back again."
1,"First of all, the guacamole made table-side is ridiculous good. I don't even like guac and I LOVED it. The margaritas are also delicious. The service was friendly and fast and the menu has a pretty good selection. I had a really good steak and shrimp and my girlfriend had some tasty fish tacos. I can't wait till we go back and enjoy the nice outside patio!"
0,This was my 4th and last foodie fest. After selling out to take casino sponsorship the new location was a complete nightmare. 45 minutes in traffic to then pay $20 a couple as we witnessed many people sneaking in free. 5 of the advertised trucks to be there were not. Foodie fest started as a local event and turned into a strip location this year. #ThankYouForRuiningThisEvent #RedDragon has to go. #Fuku and #Snowono smart enough to skip this year!
1,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! We drove down from Northern California and had to try this place after seeing all the reviews on Yelp.\n\nWe were obviously not familiar with the menu but the staff were helpful and nice. We were given a shmorgasboard of items to try.. All of their most popular items. WE loved it.. \n\nWe ate in the dining room and had jerk chicken fried rice, pulled pork, some kind of chicken i cant remember the name of and a black beans. \n\nI have never had anything like this before and I am completely amazed by the flavor and spice... wow"
1,"I was not expecting much when I looked for a facial option online on yelp, but figured I'd give Aveda a shot because it was close by and had a good amount of reviews. I called for an appointment for a facial and was able to get booked and in within the hour. \n\nI was definitely impressed when I first walked into the lobby because the environment was open and was filled with students greeting you upon walking in. It was clean and bright. They led me to the spa area right away. \n\nAgain, more students who offered refreshments and smiles. I was taken to a waiting area where I filled out information and was later introduced to Verdy who proceeded with my facial. She exceeded my expectations. She was welcoming and very knowledgeable. She explained what she was doing during the facial without being overbearing or disruptive during my session. Multiple massages were made and scents were offered to make my stay worthwhile. I did not feel rushed at all but was absolutely relaxed. The facial was what was needed and felt they took extreme care in the entire process of it. \n\nVerdy helped me even further by answering make-up questions I've had. I would say besides the professionalism and cleanliness of the facility, Verdy made my first time visit at Aveda memorable and will be returning back."
1,"So far so good. I love the guy that is usually there. I believe he owns it. They just brought in a new girl that I am not to thrilled with. My husband ordered food that was never delivered and in front  of everyone she said he didn't but we all heard him. Even if he didn't, don't argue with your guests they pay to eat your food not the other way around."
0,"Don't rent your car here!  They are not located at the same rental center as all of the other car rental places, an additional shuttle is required.  Their cars are dirty, dinged, and come with no gas.  The line is long, service is slow, and the employees don't know how to do their jobs.  They also tried to charge us for a full talk of gas after we brought the car back with 1/4 tank after getting it on empty.  I witnessed a customer asking questions about a gps unit he rented and they were very rude.  Pay a few extra dollars somewhere else to avoid these hassles, not worth saving a few dollars on vacation."
0,"Whose **** do I need to suck to get a drink around here ?\n\nOh joy. The owner's.\n\nThe tired bartenders are over worked and under staffed. When they aren't being molested by their boss they may have time to service you.\n\nThis is too painful a scene, which could very well lead to more drinking..\n\nFortunately, I have money to purchase a drink, so Ill be at Hideaway West."
1,"I enjoy the limitless selections on the salad bar. Five or Six soups to choose from. 3 types of muffins, baked potato, prepared pastas, fresh fruit, yogurt and toppings. Cold drinks, coffee, tea... I know that fast food restaurants work hard at keeping things clean. However sweeping the carpet with a broom and dustpan was a little disturbing. I know they need to tidy up, however when you begin to raise floaters that I needed to wave away from my plate. \n\nAs you enter the restaurant you make the decision as to which side of the buffet you are going to stroll. Pick up our tray and plate and get a squirt of some hand sanititzer just before you embark on the valley of veggies. It's nice that they have the sanitizer, however everyone does not partake. So it might be a good idea to have more sanitizer at the end of the line by the cashier or give out wipes at the table. Each veggie of course has its own spoon/serving utensil and I try really hard not to let that skeeve me out, know how many hands that have possibly touched each. \n\nWelllllll, that's not going to stop me! I've got my own system to help me enjoy my meal every time. LOL"
1,"I came here with a freebie gyro coupon, and I must say it was way bigger than expected, not dry and the yogurt sauce was tasty, but wish I had a little more, as I ate half and save half for the next day, with no sauce : (   . Yes the average cost for a gyro is $7-8, which is about right... And service was fast and friendly..."
1,"Eclipse is Daylight pool without the sun burn. We had a cabana  the service was on point and  the bottle presentaions were really cool. The LEDs on stage really pop at night, and the new speaker set up by the cabanas sounded really good. If your looking for an alternative from the usual vegas club scene with the same energy and good looking crowd try Eclipse. Next time I'm definitely coming in pool attire."
0,"This place is over rated. The lamb was overcooked, essentially like cardboard. I'm a huge fan of lamb, but this experience will make me second guess ordering lamb everywhere I go. We were having a decent time until the waiter came over to our table and told me to be quiet for the other guests, but there were no other guests... It made no sense so I complained to the manager and the manager said he didn't care... Thanks, I just spent ~$300 for 1 star service."
1,"Yum! I'd give 5 stars if they remembered that we also ordered a water, we had to ask for it twice, but the coffee is tasty to me."
1,I stopped in here for a pedicure as it's near my house and I figured why not try a neighborhood one.  I was glad to find out that they accept walk-ins and I was immediately seated in a comfortable massaging chair to soak for a few minutes until a technician opened up.  What I didn't expect on this Saturday morning was not only did they show the usual array of reality tv options but one tv was exclusively showing college basketball!  \n\nThere was a bit of a language barrier with the technician but this wasn't an issue as when you're seated there is a menu book presented to you with choices from basic to full VIP with a scrub.  I opted for the full one with the scrub and loved the results.  It's not the cheapest place I've ever been to but I found the cost worth it for the results and experience.
0,"It was my husbands 30th birthday! His father was in town with his girlfriend   ... And wanted to take us out to dinner... We were having a hard time coming up with somewhere to eat...and I suggested the Golden Steer..have never been, but a landmark in Vegas I had always wanted to try... I am a upscale hairstylist and take many clients out and suggest many places to clients... Who are also educated and well to do.... \nWe had reservations for 4 people at 7:45...\n    We walked in and over to his father and girlfriend sitting at the bar... they looked a bit frustrated...said they had been sitting there for 10+ mins and had not been offered a drink.. Said that \""It  seemed as if bartender couldnt have been bothered\""... Tried asking the bartender myself for a service when he had a moment... Didn't really aknowlage me and we stood there another 5 mins... I guess that should have been our sign... Decided to just go to dinner and order wine at the table... Stood at the front podium where I noticed an older lady who was our hostess? No greeting .. Just 4? And turns....we follow hoping that we should be .... Sit at the table and young man offers us water.., yes please and can we order some wine?\n             Then our waiter appears...      Fabian, I'm told later, he states  \""So we are in dire need of drinks!??\"" with a condescending undertone, but doesn't even have the wine menu with him!.. Walks back and practically drops it in my husbands lap.  Another 15 mins later ! Comes back and we eagerly order wine and an appetizer. Fabian \""our waiter\"" doesnt ask if there is a special occasion? nor does he introduce himself..or anything of that nature a waiter should do...  we are now all picking up his rude attitude around the table.. My father in laws girlfriend leans into me and says ... Did we do something wrong to our waiter? I has just wondered that myself I replied... With a shrug..;(\nWhen the wine and appetizer comes its been another length of time... Fabian drops it off and my husband has to call to him, quickly as he is already 10 feet from our table  ... \""Excuse me... But may we order please ??\"" \nThen he hastily takes our order in a way as if he is too busy to be doing so, doesn't write it down.. ...doesn't take our enormous menus from the table.\nMy husband asks him to \""Please be more diligent with us and  would you mind checking on us more often, we also need...........\"" ( I kid you not as he asking him this he is literally shaking his head yes while walking away before he can actually finish his sentence! \nA few more minutes later a NEW waiter comes, I guess Fabian just handed us off?, with our wine and is much nicer but pours my Cabernet into my father in laws Zinfandel glass with wine actually still in it (cab is red and zin is pink)  I'm sure everyone knows and hate to say it but its absolutely a fau pas to do that..... .. Wow ! That's never actually happened before ) gives me my husbands merlot and  2 down and 2 to go... Father in laws girlfriend gets her Chardonnay (yay!) and no Zinfandel for for him;(.   Ah yes okay 3 wrong 1 right... Hahaha its almost comical how bad this is going\nThe rest if the dinner is satisfactory.. ALL IN ALL... the food was very decent,  service sucked so  horribly bad that the overpriced (decent food ) was NOT worth it!! \nWill be telling my family friends and  clients not to go.."

0,"Went in today to get lunch at this place. I walked in and stood there waiting to be acknowledged...not happening. There were several employees that saw me and didn't even acknowledge me. I stood there for approximately two minutes waiting and I turned around and left. No smile, no welcome to Philly's Famous just a blank stare and a conscious avoidance. I won't be back."
1,"I flew in from Los Angeles to this dealership to buy a Certified Preowned Vehicle. I was dealing with Zachary Hoffman who is with Internet Sales. He was very helpful from the beginning and answered all of my questions promptly through e-mail. We agreed on a decent price That I was comfortable with.\n\nMy only concern was the condition of the vehicle, pictures don't do much, I didn't want to fly to Arizona and arrive to a beat up car. Zach assured me the car was in excellent condition and that I had nothing to worry about. I was worried the paint might have some scratches or swirls that were visible. I was also worried that the interior would have blemishes or tears that were not obvious in the pictures.\n\nNeedless to say when I landed at the airport Zach picked me up at the airport and took me to the dealership, when I arrived I saw the car instantly in the showroom. It was in excellent condition as he promised. The paint was top notch for a 2010 car. The car had brand new tires as he mentioned, they were really brand new. The interior pretty much looked new, no flaws at all. \n\nWe went on a test drive and Zach showed me all the cool features the car had. I had previously already driven this model and thought I knew everything about, Zach showed me a couple of cool features I wasn't even aware of. He really knew a lot about the car as well, which was very cool. Most people just know the key features or whatever is in the window sticker, Zach just knew it all.\n\nFinancing went pretty smooth, Zach made sure I was in and out of financing pretty quick since he knew I would be driving back all the way to Los Angeles.\n\nI would recommend this dealer to anyone in the area, the whole staff was very nice and eager to help. Big thanks to Zach though for making this whole experience smooth and hassle free. Oh yeah the dealership also filled up the gas tank all the way, I didn't have to fill up the whole way home, that was great!"
1,"Never had traditional Venezuelan food before but this hit the spot!  Can't go wrong with any of the arepas offered here!  If you're near the strip, make a stop here!"
1,"Michael our waiter was a gent and knows his stuff. I had the prime rib and while it was a bit fatty it was absolutely amazing. Seasoned to perfection. \n\nI also had the pork belly mac and cheese bites which are very tasty and filling thus I left a few behind so I could eat my prime rib! The Caesar salad was pretty good too.  \n\nI was surprised at how quiet it was for peak season, hence I guess why they are resigned to excellent groupon deal which I availed of. The Jameson ginger weather cocktail was amazing too and really strong which I like as an Irishman! Beautiful white linen cloth tables and immaculately clean floor makes this restaurant look as well as taste the part."
0,"THIS GYM IS HORRIBLE!! DO NOT EVER GO THERE!! They are CROOKS! They say it's $10/month, but they don't mention all the hidden fees. AND unless you cancel on the first day of the month, they'll charge you for the next month! So, I just tried to cancel my account, it is only June 10th, and I'm getting charged for the month of July!\n\nThe employees are rude. The managers are assholes. The trainers are rude. A lot of their equipment have broken parts. The drinking fountain water is warm. They do not offer any classes. \n\nI was lied to by omission the day I signed up. When I told this to a manager the day I tried to cancel, she basically called me a liar and refused to waive the extra fees.\n\nSeriously, DO NOT USE this gym!! After all the hidden fees, it's closer to $20 a month than $10 a month, and at that rate, just spend a little extra and join a GOOD gym instead."
0,I should have eaten my money instead. It would have had more flavor and been more satisfying.
1,"Don't believe I have ever had a bad visit to this place.  They know the family (because they frequent here often) and so we are usually greeted by first name.  It is a nice place to relax, get a fw drinks, and eat while visiting the Family.  The steak was very good, prices were not as crazy as I was expecting - but then again it is always nice when Dad picks up the tab."
1,We went with Chris at Buddy's plumbing after reading reviews to fix a clogged kitchen sink (the sink was filling up with water: strange).  Our problem was urgent and he was able to change his schedule to fit us in immediately. He was very pleasant and easy to talk to.  He explained in detail what the problem was and what he was doing. I felt absolutely comfortable watching what he was doing (normally I don't like watching) but Chris answered all my questions along the way. I'm curious how this stuff works so that maybe the next time I could do it myself. He used a hose that I had lying around the garage and took $20 off the final bill (nice surprise).
0,"So my boyfriend and I decided to visit this location after being thrilled with the recent facelift and menu upgrades to the Salty's in Scottsdale. Unfortunately and fortunately, our mediocre at best experience here has also reminded me to leave the Scottsdale location a stellar review (sorry Peoria!). \n\nWe went on a Sunday and this place was ghost town dead. At first impression, this place seems like a cool hangout for weekend get togethers, but upon further look, you can definitely tell this place is in serious need of a facelift. The columns are missing chunks of tile, the tables and barstools have seen better days and are falling apart, and one of the tvs we couldn't tell if it was just old or if there was some dried substance running down it. Overall the place just looks dark and dirty. On to the food....\n\nThe menu at this location is not the same updated menu from the Scottsdale location but still has similar dishes. We opted for \""tableside\"" guac (our favorite), and the fundido. The appetizers came out lightening fast, which you would think is a good thing, but it was almost too fast. The guac was brought out to us rather than made tableside  and had brown oxidation and oil separated from the dip like it had been sitting out all day. You could tell from the taste as well it was not fresh. The fundido was similar, like congealed velveeta that had been sitting out too long. We also had to separate some chips out from our basket because they were soggy with oil. For entree we shared a 6 taco basket with chicken tinga, grilled steak, the mahi taco, and the breaded fish taco. My boyfriend described the tinga as \""alright\"" and while the flavor of the steak was good, the pieces were minced so small that the texture was unappealing, almost like dog food. The chipotle crema saved the mahi taco but I think the taco was missing avocado slices, I couldnt remember from the menu if that was supposed to be included or not. The breaded fish taco was okay but was missing both avocado and sauce as described which was disappointing. Unfortunately, we're now both at home with upset stomachs, headaches, and nausea :(\n\nOn the brightside, our server was nice and checked in on us often. No complaints there. Unfortunately this wasn't enough to convince us to return though; next time we'll probably go back to the Scottsdale location. It's sad, this place has so much potential I feel like they are just not taking advantage of."
1,"Zoom in... Zoom out...  If you need the pressure checked in your tires this is the best and fastest way to do it.  They have a lane dedicated to just checking your air and filling you up:)  Only problem, I forgot to have them check my spare.  Wish they would automatically do it since it is just hanging on the back door!!!"
1,"This is a great place for group lunch over the weekend. The lunch price is great, but dinner is a little expensive. The decoration and environment is great. The backroom is quieter and roomier. \n\nThe best part of the restaurant is that you can order sashimi, as long as they have the same fish available in their sushi. They also have some special sea weeds that no other buffet restaurants have in the valley."
1,"Okay, the Golden Gate is over 100 years old and I suppose they had a weird way of mapping out buildings back then. I step into the already cramped and crowded place and walk smack dab into what turns out to be Du-Par's Deli/Cafeteria (why would they have the same name?). I pick up a tray but then I notice that the pies and pancakes on display that I was told to look for aren't there and I had to walk through about 10 different people to get out of line. Awkward. Turns out there's a somewhat hidden hallway on the other side of the main \""casino\"" (if you can even call it that, more like a larger than average tavern with blackjack tables) which leads to the diner. What an odd little building. \n\nOkay so on to the point of this review. Coffee Shops/Cafes have gotten so flashy and hip nowadays (at least in Las Vegas), sometimes all I want is a basic sandwich and fries with no truffles or Parmesan crusts or the quintessential breakfast (bacon, eggs, sausage, hash browns and pancakes) with a price tag significantly less than $20. This place is indeed no frills (I wouldn't be surprised if the place hasn't changed that much since the 50's appearance wise, which is a good thing in my humble out of the ordinary opinion) but unfortunately the prices are a tad steep (nowhere near as bad as cafes in a lot of the newer places on The Strip but a bit off-putting given that this is the ancient and notoriously dinky Golden Gate on Fremont St.). That being said, the food is good.\nI hadn't eaten all day at the time I came here so I just went on ahead and got a burger (ironic, since I was looking for somewhere non fast food to eat in the first place), the patty was a bit too small for the bun, but it did hit the spot. Then I had a piece of the pie everyone raves about. A slice of Pecan pie to be exact, that hit the spot even further. Very attentive and prompt service as well, which is what I expected given that the space is already so small and there weren't many patrons. \n\nI didn't care for the prices, but I would come here again. Growing up in a city so hell-bent on reinventing and/or swanking up everything, I'm a sucker for old fashioned, down to earth gems like this."
0,"Service was mediocre.  Asked for the dishes to come out as they're ready, because we were starving...but the dishes came out together and a few were lukewarm.  Since the temperature was off, they didn't taste that great. \n\nThe interior is super-dark, in the afternoon, this was just annoying.  \n\nThe only plus is that they offer mini-pastries."
0,"It is open on sunday.  It has stuff in it.  The fruitcups were good.  I got a premade \""Italian\"" sandwich.  Which I regreted buying almost as soon as I walked out the store.  I dobnt know what else to say about this place."
1,"Looking for a night cap after a really nice dinner nearby, we were attracted to the space by the amble bottles of back bar visible from the street. Glad we stumbled in as this has to be the coolest bar/restaurant/deli/store/etc/etc in town. We were amazed by how much is really going on here, and that is a good thing!  As other reviewers have stated, the bartenders (and that is an insult to label these talented professionals as that) are fantastic. Super knowledgeable but also attentive and social. These guys treat the cocktail as a work of Art. So nice to see the passion from staff. Next time we will eat for sure.....or maybe just enjoy the drinks again. Can't wait to go back. 4 stars only because we didn't eat but bar is 5 star for sure."

Auch bei seiner R\u00fcckkehr kein Wort der Entschuldigung, dass er uns einfach hatte stehen und warten lassen.

1,"The food here is pretty authentic Chinese.  Not what you'd get in Chinatown obviously, but pretty good for a casino restaurant.  The Mongolian beef was very good, but the portion was tiny.  Very tiny.\n\nIt is a bit pricy, but the service is very good.  Our waitress was very attentive.  She even brought over a box of tissue when she noticed a person at our table sneezing.\n\nThe only thing that was kind of disappointing was that since we has ordered dessert, we didn't get the fortune cookies and shooters.  And from all the other reviews on yelp, it seemed like that was the best part of the meal.  :("
1,"If you don't have time to make it from Phoenix up to the Grand Canyon, then the Tonto National Forest is the next best thing. Seriously! My friends told me that this is where they take people who want to see the natural beauty of the area and they aren't kidding!\n\nThe washboard road is a 20+ mile ride along route 88 and the Apache Lake. The scenic views are constant and some of them are even well marked with paved parking lots and National Park Service bathrooms along the way.\n\nTips:\nI wouldn't recommend taking the whole ride if you're someone who gets carsick.\nYou want a car with really good brakes and shocks. It is NOT a smooth ride.\nMake sure you have plenty of gas.\nPlan ahead. The ride took us three hours. You don't want to be doing this in the afternoon with the sun setting. This is not the type of road you want to drive at night!\n\nNotes:\nMost of the park does not have cellular coverage. I'm not kidding about this!\nBe careful when walking around. It's Arizona and while the snakes and other creatures are afraid of you, they will attack you if they feel threatened."
0,"Just visited the HOTEL soon to be renamed Delano...we actually stayed in their all new Delano room, the hotel room itself is well designed, but the customer experience was horrible, and deserved 0 star!\n\nThe check-in took 45 minute when there were only 3-4 parties in front of me, although they are going through with their renovation, this is no excuse for the long wait.  We had specifically booked for a suite with 2 beds, but they weren't able to give us a regular room, so we ended up with a room that was designed for handicapped visitors (restrooms with handle bars).\n\nUpon entering the room, there trash left over from the previous visitor (unfinished drinks left on the table), and then the rest room there were half-washed glass cups (cuts with foams and not yet rinsed)....obviously someone was rushing to clean the rooms and forgot everything.\n\nFollowing morning, we requested for housekeeping by pushing the housekeeping button, but NO-SHOW, no housekeeping, we had to call again only to get a disgruntled cleaning lady who was very unwilling to come in and clean. After cleaning the room, and leaving, they left their cleaning detergents in the room.\n\nOverall, a very very poor customer service/experience for a very expensive room."
0,"not a fan of this place, espoecially when from where I was sitting I had to obseve them scrubbing the kitchen floor (at 5PM) and then get up and make food while walking on the soapy floor...not sure if they washed their hands...kinda grossed me out.  Food was overpriced and not that good."

Very sad and I hate to be \""one of those d*cks\"" yelping about it.\n\n :("
1,"I find myself gravitating towards the pork reigns specialty pizza.  Sometimes dough can be undone but nothing a little oven time can't fix at home.  The owner/manager is awesome, he REALLY cares about his customers and product he's putting out. The garlic knots I do find myself unable to share with anyone else but myself.  Plan on going back as long as I live in the area."
0,I wish I could give no stars. The food was good but wait staff was serving dirty dishes next to new food. When telling the manager he said they clean then wash there hands then serve food. But how could that be when the only sink is in the bathroom. This is just gross!
1,"Love this place, Deion is awesome.\nGreat willingness to help before, during & after sale. I would recommend this store and this customer service superstar to everyone. He has shown me he's about building relationships with his customers."

0,"Went into the branch with my mom so she could collect an IRA distribution. It's not the first time we've done this, and we had already called to have the distribution center release the funds, which they said would be available today. We had gone to the branch at Stephanie and Sunset first, as it is closer to where we were, but the banker kept telling my mom that she had to call someone first. He had decided to not listen to my mom, that he knew better about the situation, and sent us away. So we left and went to another branch 10 minutes down the road, where they were able to get us in and out in 15 minutes, WITHOUT HAVING TO CALL ANYONE ON THE PHONE. Had the first branch had better customer service and actually listened to the customer, rather than assume that they knew better than the customer (perhaps because she speaks English with an accent?), we might have saved an hour of hour time. They at least owe us the gas money to go to the branch who would actually listen."

0,"Seriously this store looks like it got robbed.  Everywhere I went to get something all I found was an empty shelf or a lonely peg board staring me in the face.  I looked down the half isle of computer software they carry and could not find my product.  So I asked someone, he made the same walk I did.  Really???  Check your inventory or stock area dumbass, I didn't come here to see your shoulder shrug.  The back room was probably as sad as the shelves here.  My husband found a cable he needed, and maybe I'm naive about computer crap but, they wanted almost fourty bucks for a six foot cord.  I said we'd shop around.  We walked out with a DVD and frown.  I will never bother with this store again.  Well, maybe a going-out-of-buisness sale."
1,Hidden gem in vegas. Not overpriced. Good selection and its tasty. The only issue is that this is in the stratosphere and that side of vegas is dead. If anyone could clarify if they make their dough fresh everyday than this could maybe be a 5 in my book.
0,Very disappointed. Service was too slow due to being short staffed. I had to send my pizza back twice because there was so much corn meal on the bottom it was gritty and not worth eating. Had to ask for refills more then once and also ketchup for the fries. No wonder they are giving Groupons for this place.
0,Normal makeup application with an appointment is $50 and you get a free mascara. If you do not have an appointment there is a $50 product fee. I called to get an appointment on October 27 and because this is the weekend before Halloween they want to charge $70 and you have to purchase a gift card. I thought that was petty. I will not be booking at MAC.

Anyway we finally got our food and it had been sitting under heat lamps for a while as everything was dry and cold. Thanks to our garbage waiter our experience was atrocious. \n\nI understand this place is aimed at children, but if you are charging the same price as a five star restaurant you're shit better be in a row. Don't eat here go anywhere else."
1,"Great Sushi!  Very fresh but a little pricey.  The place has an excellent ambiance...great for celebrations!  Location at the Epicenter is great, especially if you are planning to go out for drinks afterwards."
1,Great environment and fun place to go out on a date. Las vegas and caterpillar rolls are my favorite from here. Sake bombers are also tasty. Guys don't get caught looking at the ultra fine greeters when you enter the restaurant. Specially when you are with your girl like I was lol.
0,"In November of 2012 I had a pea sized spot on my underarm that didn't look right, so my PCP referred me to Woodson Dermotology.  \n\nI saw the PA, John.  I made a 7:15am appointment and was seen immediately, literally no wait.  He was VERY nice and examined the spot and informed me that it was ringworm.  I was surprised, as I had ringworm a number of years ago.  But I trusted him and took the pills and cream I was prescribed.  I had a follow-up appoint the next month, and explained to him that it's only getting bigger (MUCH bigger) and didn't look or feel like ringworm.  It was not itchy, did not spread, not scaly, and didn't seem to be contagious.  He reassured me that it \""just presents differently in the armpit\"" I was frustrated but took the new pills and creams I was given.  Again, nothing happened except it was getting BIGGER.  I again had a follow up the next month and expressed my concerns AGAIN.  Nothing, just more creams and pills. This went on and on every month until JULY!!!  For 8 freaking months this man told me I had ringworm... ringworm that was not contagious, not itchy, and didn't even resemble ringworm, and NO drugs he gave me had ANY EFFECT WHATS SO EVER.  To me, that would be a red flag that maybe, just maybe I got this diagnosis wrong, but he refused that he could be wrong.  Upon googling it, I read that even UNTREATED ringworm lasts a maximum of 4 months.  \n\nI would much rather hear \""I'm not really sure what this is! Let's do a biopsy, or call in Dr. whoever to get another opinion\""  rather than swear you're right when you know you're wrong.  But he is too proud to do that.  \n\n In July I went in and there was a PA fresh out of school that John was training.  This PA took ONE look at my \""ringworm\"" and said there's no way that's ringworm!!!  He said it looked like Granuloma Annulare.  He said he would talk to John and come back in.  All of a sudden John thinks it's this now.  But just to be sure, he gives me yet another cream.  I recognized the name of the cream, so I told him, \""I think you have given me this before\"" he said \""hmmm, let me look.... No, we haven't given you any creams before\""  I was flabbergasted!  I have had a minimum of 5 creams prescribed to me.  I bit my tongue just wanting this appointment to be over.  He said if this cream didn't fix it they would do a biopsy (why he didn't do that 8 freaking MONTHS ago is beyond me!) so I get home and find the exact same cream that did nothing 3 months before when he prescribed it to me the first time!  I was furious!  I just kept telling myself, \""just get the biopsy and you will never have to go here again!\""  So of course nothing changed except it got bigger (about the size of a half dollar now, very visible as it is growing beyond my armpit and onto my arm and looks like a huge human bite mark) and another one growing next to it.  So he decided to do the punch biopsy. \n\n At this appointment as well as all the other appointments they asked what I am allergic to.  I read off the list, among them is polysporin.  The assistant was very nice and when she was done she grabbed a Q-tip with a cream on it.  She got about an inch away and I said \""what is that?\""  she said \""polysporin\""  I quickly yell \""I'm allergic to that!\"" before she can get any on me.  Why do you even ask what I am allergic to?  Seriously!  I was supposed to come back 2 weeks later to get the results and get my stitches out. \n\n So 2 weeks later I come back to get my Biopsy results and stitches removed. She took out my stitches and started to leave.  I said \""Excuse me, do you have my biopsy results?\"" she said \""No\"" and started to walk again.  I said \""Are you sure, it's been 2 weeks\"" She sighed and actually opened my file this time (imagine that!) and said \""oh yeah, here it is, it's benign\""  I said \""ok, but is it the granuloma annulare?\"" she said \""yes, that was positive\""  I said \""ok, can you tell me what that is or anything about it?\""  She said she wasn't familiar with it.  OK...... \""can I talk to John or anyone else that does know?\""  She said \""no, they're all busy, but you can make another appointment in a few weeks to talk to him if you have questions\"" I was done, didn't give an answer just stormed out, said goodbye and thank you to the only person worth a crap there (the front office) and went home. \n\n Why would you have someone give you biopsy results and not tell you anything about it?!?  I have wasted almost a YEAR of my life and missing work to go to these appointments every month, because John was too proud to admit he was wrong.  I would love to thank the new guy that diagnosed me at first sight, but never saw him again.  Please don't waste your time here!  If you get a super early appointment there is no wait, John is VERY nice, however none of that matters if you can't get treated for what it actually wrong."
0,"I will say this first. Our waiter Joey was amazing. Best thing about this place. \n\nNow the food . . . Oh, the food. Appetizers did the opposite. Crackling calamari was disgusting. The squid was bland and overly oily. The spicy aioli was pretty much just mayo. The lollipop chicken wings were the best thing taste wise, but the chef needs to learn how to properly prepare these. Requires more than just scraping the top part of the flesh from the bone.\n\nGiven we ordered a salad for dinner here, so I wasn't expecting much. The chopped chicken salad was a joke. The ingredients didn't taste fresh, pretty sure the mushrooms and olives were from a can. The chicken was massacred and thrown at the bottom so you could see the poor knife skills. The Caeser Salad was sheer ridiculousness. Frankly if you can count the individual amount of Parmesan cheese in your salad on one hand, there is an issue. The dressing only tasted of mayo. \n\nWish we did not come here to eat. I would avoid any of these items if you come here. I say again however, service was great."
0,"After two recent visits here, I can honestly say I am torn on my review, but overall I know I have had better. Most recently, we arrived shortly after 12 and were seated indoors, because the patio was full, and it took our server over 15 minutes to take our drink order. We started off with the spinach artichoke dip and chips, which arrived 5 minutes before our food. Before I get to the food, the appetizer was cold and came with about 10 chips. Being there were four of us we asked for some extra chips and some salsa. The chips were warm, however the salsa, stay away, unless you like Pace's from the grocery store. Really, are they kidding serving store bought salsa???\nOn to the food.  We ordered a good variety, stuffed peppers, chicken enchiladas, burger and chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn! The enchiladas and peppers were so spicy we had to ask for more water. Only positive, the fries, great seasoning!\nAs for the service, I wish I took her name, but our waitress could have given two sh...about being there and you could tell. No refills, never saw her, except our order and bill, and very blah! \nNot sure we would return anytime soon."
0,"On my most recent Vegas trip, I went for a bachelor's party, and Hooters is where they guys wanted to stay. Though I prefer to lodge elsewhere, I didn't want to separate myself from the group, so I took a deep breath, and dived into the place that I was so happy to check OUT of a couple of days later. \n\nMy feeling of dejection began the moment we pulled into the garage. Everything is tightly packed in the garage, so each time we turned a corner to ascend to the next level, I had to close my eyes out of fear of that we'd scrape the car against a pillar, or another vehicle. In the garage, there's an elevator, which takes you to the casino level of the main building. The elevator is as dirty and raggedy as something you'd see in a rundown portion of an old NYC subway station. Unlike many other hotel/casinos, which have adequate ventilation systems, to counter the smoke, this casino floor smelled like a tobacco factory. I will give credit to the check-in staff, however, they were very friendly, and a pleasure to interact with! The rooms were ok, nothing special, but it was clean, no bad smells, and I did have a decent view of the strip (8th floor). It's an older no-frills place, so I wasn't expecting marble floors and stone counter tops, so I was ok with what was there. The only issue that I had inside of the room was the shower. The shower heads have only one pressure setting, and it feels like needles pricking your skin. Otherwise, the accommodations where aligned with the pricing of the facility. \n\nI'd say there's a very low likelihood that I'll ever lodge at Hooters again. For me, it's definitely more worthwhile to spend the extra money and stay someplace directly on the strip, with a higher star rating. For the drunken Las Vegas visitor, who just needs a place to sleep, then this is the place for you. Again, despite my dislike for the place overall, I give kudos to the check-in staff for maintaining customer service competence, regardless of the surroundings."
1,"Not really a secret...its clearly marked on the hotel property map - 3rd Floor, unmarked hallway with vinyl's on the wall.  Maybe if you're not a guest of the hotel its more of a secret ;)   Depending on what time you go, the line can be lengthy but it seems to move quickly.  Counter style ordering; very few seats inside, several pies to choose from (either full pie or slice).  Even PBR on draft!  Once you pick your flavor, the slice gets sent back in the oven for a few minutes... comes to you warm, crunchy and just delicious!  Pay the man and then either find a seat inside (unlikely) or take your slice outside into the main hotel area.   Along the back wall you can find hot pepper flakes and Parmesan to top your slice off - yum!\n\nThe pizza was thin crunchy crust just how I like it and had good flavor!   I was happy to try this spot, even if it was a late night snack!"
1,Boris was great and fixed my refrigerator defroster problem.  He was very professional.   The parts came in very fast within 4 days.  I am very pleased with the company.
0,Horrible food. Horrible. Weak service. A disgrace to the South Side Works.
1,"Hands down best Mexican food.  Nice folk behind the counter, even when it's slammed.  Drink bar is a wreck, salsa is excellent.  Sometimes there isn't a table. We still go, it's an institution around here.  I have yet to manage to have menudo there.  Holiday tortillas are to die for.  Everyone is pleasant, including the customers. And it's not a zillion dollars plus tip."
0,"I was looking forward to a show in Vegas. We were staying at the Stratosphere so we did receive discount tickets (if I had paid full price I would have been fully ripped off). The headliner Clair SinClair....has a nice speaking voice perhaps her next gig will be to replace Vanna White on Wheel of Fortune, she is pretty but her part in the show is minimal at best. Her speaking parts left the audience wondering why she was speaking. The dancers are good and the singer is good for most of the numbers but some were hard on the ears. The band is very good, we would have rather listened to them.\n\nOne of the people in our party even fell asleep that is how good the show was. We stayed thinking it would get better, it really didn't. The first half is definitely better...so if you want to leave do so by June it is pretty much down hill from there.  \n\n The show is a run through Claire's pin up calendar.... longest year of our lives! We were eagerly awaiting Christmas but it never came. \n\nIf you want entertainment at the Stratosphere go see Frankie Moreno.... that show EVERYONE ENJOYED!"
0,Two people working returns on the day after Christmas crazy had to wait 20 minutes for an exchange with only two people in front if me!! Will not return unless forced to return a gift!
1,"$10.99 AYCE Breakfast. $15.99 AYCE Lunch. One of the better deals in and around Vegas.  They have so much variety! Plus, you can get alcoholic drinks included with your meal! The servers are pretty friendly, too, compared to other places I go to, and the open space makes it feel so relaxing.\n\nThe food is typical buffet food.  What makes it go above and beyond the other buffets is the price, service, and variety.  The flan was delicious.  And if there was something I'd have to choose here to eat over and over again, I'd probably go with the mussel.  Oh yes, lunch will include some breakfast items (bacon, eggs, sausages).  No omelette, though."
0,the service was so slow we discussed stiffing the waiter (would never).  the food (hot wings and chicken and waffles) was very good! so were our mind bender drinks.
1,"I have passed by this location for years however I had never stopped to have an actual service done until today. I have gotten plenty of air checks done here but that was about it.  I do still go to the one in North Scottsdale but they will now have serious some competition since they are kinda close to me house (N.Scottsdale is close to work). I must say that every time I have stopped ( yes I know I have only one check-in but I was never here for longer than 5 mins. I mean why check in for an air check?) it has always been after right a mad rush which is AWESOME for me because that means in and out quick. Even the oil changed I received on a Sunday no less, they had me in and out in what 30 mins tops? Crystal, whom I remember from my favorite Scottsdale location works here and she is one bad (as in very good) mechanic/service tech! I so adore her as well as Tim who was a manager.  Any who, If you are ever in the area, stop by get your services done, and keep it moving. They are friendly, fast, fair and they let you know what needs to be done either right then and there or sometime soon."
1,Hanging in Charlotte for the weekend and this was the first place we ate.  Well...ain't we lucky?!  We ordered a BBQ chicken burrito and a steak burrito.  Both were great.  Fun atmosphere and quirky hipster crowd.  We ate there on a warm spring night when the food trucks were across the way and had smiles all around.\n\nPre-conceived ideal burrito folk:  This place is not Chipotle.  Not worse or better...just a totally different meal and (especially) experience.  Enjoy a phatty burrito and spend your money locally.
0,"I will preface this review by saying that I usually go to Bond. Nail Lounge, but I was in a bind and this place is close to my house, so I thought I'd give it a shot based on their good reviews. I'm not sure how this place has such high ratings, as my experience was definitely not on par with their 4.5 star rating. This place is just a dressed up chop shop. Customer service was lacking, and I had to move to a different tech to polish my nails after they were filled. The girl that did my fill seemed like she was in a crazy hurry and was super rough, although I will say that I was super pleased with the shape and thickness of my nails. The polish is where it all went wrong. The guy was also in a rush and was shakey and could not get my rhinestone embellishments into a straight line to save his life. I figured that, being a chop shop, my crappy nails would at least be cheap...wrong! $70 for an acrylic fill with gel polish and a few rhinestones. Needless to say I will not be back, which sucks since it would be super convenient. I am sure each tech is different, and you might get lucky and get a decent one, but for what they charge everything should be on point!"
1,"I visited Tina's Nails from a recommendation and just gotta say, that the staff was wonderful! Everyone was so nice and gave me suggestions on what to do w/ my nails since i'm a manicure-virgin! i had to tell myself to go and get pampered and i chose the right place to go! they went thru the services they offered and suggested colors for me and were so friendly! The salon is VERY clean and spa chairs are so comfy! Looks like i'll have to get in to the habit of pampering myself more- with a great place that is happy to have my business, and treat me like family, why not?!"
0,"Went to dinner tonight and it was different  from every other experience I have ever had at Pig & Pickle. This was just upsetting. The server didn't have much time for our table and actually let us know that. The food was good as usual, but the service ruined my night. I'm disappointed. Worst birthday dinner ever."
1,"The Bar at Times Square is an awesome place to get drunk at. Plus, I love that you don't have to get dressed up. Usually, the crowd is friendly and loud. Everyone has the same agenda and that is to get trashed and have a good time. I also love that they have dueling pianos here. They know every song and they know them well. They really get the crowd involved. I swear everyone sings along. If you are looking for a fun night, you will definitely find it here."
1,"We live in the burbs.. it's Friday at 11 PM.. we're hungry.. and lazy.. what's one to do? Luckily Angelina's exists! They deliver until Midnight - one of the few places in the Henderson burbs that delivers past 11. \n\nIt's a pizza place but we weren't feeling pizza. So we tried the stromboli and a philly cheese steak with fries (yup pretty weird combination!). \n\nWe made the mistake of ordering the medium stromboli - oops - that thing was monster sized. Tasty but doesn't compare to Four Kegs!\n\nI was pretty worried about ordering a philly cheesesteak and fries for delivery but I was blown away by how tasty it was. No, it's not as good as the philly steaks in Philadelphia (no surprise there!), but incredible nonetheless. The fries somehow survived the delivery without getting soggy, either !\n\nOverall for \""junk food\"" delivery that's open late, I was really happy with the quality."
0,"Meal was great, waiter was fantastic.  That being said, the front desk staff and the bar staff leave alot to be desired.  We had reservations for 7:45 for 3 people which we arrived promptly for only to be informed they had us down for 7:30 and that they were running at least  1/2 hour behind.  When you have tickets to a show in Vegas, having your restaurant running 1/2 behind is no bueno.  Little could be done, you can't just walk into another restaurant and be seating so we waited. They had no empathy and frankly had an uppity attitude about the whole thing.   I decided to get a glass of wine while we waited.  The girls behind the bar completely ignore female patrons.  I actually had to get the wine list from the gentlemen beside me.  Finally, a male bartender surfaced and I got my glass of wine. \n\nOnce seated, the entire experience changed and turned into what we were expecting.  Great vibe, great food, great wait staff, ready with info about Gluten free options.  Now if they could just get the front of their house and the bar in order, they'd be a premier restaurant in Vegas."
1,"I can't believe it's taken me 2 years of living in Madison to find this place. Staff is super nice and helpful, prices are reasonable. Great selection of different cooking utensils and tools (the rack of spoons, spatulas, turners and tongs sent my heart aflutter). It took all of my willpower to not load up on fifty different cooking spoons. Great place for gifts. Decent selection of harder to find ingredients (hawaiian sea salt, mexican chocolate, etc). \n\nI haven't tried the cooking school though because I am just too slow at signing up for the classes I want to take. They're always full WEEKS in advance!"

1,"Dear Yelp, it's official: I AM 21. :D\n\nFor my 21st birthday, I spent the night at a room here. I must say, quite a fun place to spend a 21st birthday at!\n\nRoom: HUGE. To begin with, it was already in the older tower and yet it was still quite impressive. Two comfortable beds, a couch, a chair, a table/mini-office space and a fridge....it was almost like a miniature apartment. The view was also quite amazing, looking right over the pool and straight at the Strip. Oh, and it had a fridge, a plus seeing I needed to have refreshments for the get-together I was having.\nService: Can't really say, we were just partying it up in there. \nLocation: Not on The Strip, but close enough, with free shuttle service to Harrahs and Ballys. \nPool: It was amazing with a bold, capital A. Crowded, but not overwhelmingly so. Beautiful people all around, and not overrun with the douchebags you see so much of at somewhere like, say, the Palms or Mandalay Bay pool areas. One cheesy, but cool touch was the waterfall that came out of a clam. \nMiscellaneous: As great as the room was, I was charged a security deposit of $50 that I had no way of knowing about beforehand. At least it wasn't a blasted resort fee, but still.\n\nThe Final Verdict:\n\nPros:\nMore than enough space.\nFridge in the room.\nLovely view.\nEpic pool.\nFree shuttle to the Strip.\nNice enough bathroom. \nOffered two free passes to the Voodoo Lounge.\nLots of things to do on the property.\nGot the room for a pretty sweet price as well ($53.00).\n\nCons:\nSneaky security deposit. It's refunded when you check out but still. \n\nSuggestions: Please let people know about the security deposit in advance. So next time someone wants to have their birthday there they won't be $50 short on drinking and partying funds. \n\nWould I stay here again? I'd stay here again just for that pool."
0,"So in my last review I wrote that it probably didn't taste any different than any other place, and I'd like to correct that. It DOESN'T taste any different than any other place. At the time of my first review, I hadn't been there in over 1 year. I went in to give it another chance, had a smoked meat sandwich, looked at the place, got disgusted, and left. How they can let it get so dirty is beyond me. I've tried better. And the place is MUCH cleaner. What place you ask? well I don't know if it's fair to the owner's of this place if I post it in the review, but it's right next door to H&M (downtown) on Saint Catherines street O (West). Place starts with an R"
1,"I've been trying to try this place out for so long! Something always came up and I wasn't able to go!\n\nI ordered the American Kobe with pepper jack cheese, spinach, jalapeno and aioli!  It was sooo good!!  The meat was tender and juicy! mmmm yummmy! \n\nMy boyfriend got the buffalo burger and I think I like it more than the american kobe!  It was more tasty.  \n\nFor sides we got the jalapeno friend pickles - yummmmy\nThe sweet potato fries - a must get!\nThe fried zucchini - for some reason, theirs were so good!\nAnd some onion rings - I can skip these next time\n\nI love how they have burgers for the people who don't like to build their burgers and of course having the option of building your own burgers.\n\nWhat else is cool is that you can even build your own milkshakes!! =)\n\nI think this place is pretty awesome!  Both in the menu and the food!"
1,"If you're looking for great sushi at a reasonable price, this place is as good as you will find in Vegas. It's a little bit of a haul (15-20 minutes from the strip) so you really have to be in the mood for sushi.\n\nAs far as other dishes, I would recommend you not expend the cab fare. While the black cod soy and hamachi kama were good,  I'm just not that big a fan of cod or hamachi. The asparagus and avocado tempura were relatively flavorless and the beef, chicken and shrimp skewers were either overcooked or poor cuts of meat. Avoid the skewers!\n\nThe service was acceptable but we had a little bit of a language barrier. They were nice and got the food out quick without overlap in dishes. The atmosphere was cool.\n\nThe verdict - outstanding sushi - meh everything else - you have to really be in the mood for sushi given the drive.\n\nSmiley face"

0,"Not a great start - 7pm and took 12 minutes for a hostess to appear. \n\nFood took over an hour to arrive, and and took almost 45 minutes for them to explain that the kitchen was behind. \n\nDrinks were very slow, so, they are still. OT doing to great.\n\nI've been here before, and never had it that bad.\n\nPatio doors were opened up, and the restaurant was pretty warm and stuffy inside.\n\nFood was fresh and warm, but, couple of issues and mistakes on the order itself."
0,"I have been here a total of 6 times and because I want them to succeed  I keep going back.  They get one more chance, then I am done!!   The good news is this place has great food.   I could not  help but compare Pancheros to Chipotle.  Both are equal distances from my house.  Both places have comparable food.   The challenge for Pancheros is Chipotle customer service is far superior.  This staff at this location lacks passion, commitment and enthusiasm toward their food and their customers.    Wait times are excruciating even when there is a very short line.  This is despite being fully staffed.  Today, they ran out of meat and did not ask for more until they were scraping the bottom of the pan.  This caused additional wait times for me and 3 people behind me.  This is a bottleneck that could easily be avoided by anticipating your needs in advance!!  \n\nThe owners of this establishment need to turn this around quickly. They need to role model what great looks like in terms of driving a positive customer experience.  Word of mouth has to be killing them!!  Lets hope they fix this  before its to late!!   My rating is for consistently receiving bad service and their complete lack of awareness to do anything about it."
1,Definitely going back. Want to try it for dinner with cocktails ;). Took my Indian friend there and was a little worried. He likes food spicy. But he loved it! Ate my hummus too. The food was very flavorful and the portions were generous.\nI had the Souvlaki and my friend had the Beef & Lamb Gyro. Prices were good. I do want to go back and try the Moussaka and Baklava.
1,Great food I love the coconut shrimp. The menu has a huge selection which you can enjoy for a month without eating the same thing.
1,I love their pizza.\n\nThe crust is delish and the sauce rules.
1,We were looking for a new Asian restaurant and found it here. I had the Pad Thai and it was wonderful. Great chicken soup and service
0,"I reviewed these idiots back in July and filed a Better Business Bureau complaint against them.  \n\nThe empty platitudes from Heather at Danny's corporate that they do a great job for a good price ... Really?  20+ dollars for a VIP wash and the back is not vacuumed, the windows are streaky, there are still bugs all over the grill and hood?  \n\nOffering me a \""free\"" crappy carwash  or try and intimidate me when I point out the car is not clean is no offer at all.  I do not feel safe patronising this business at this location.  Maybe someone has had good service from another location but stay away from this one.\n\nI actually never expected to get a refund as these folks have over and over demonstrated they DO NOT CARE when you attempt to bring something to their attention. They have the worst customer service I think I have ever experienced anywhere and getting your car washed there is a complete waste of time and money.  They do a crappy job, and you may get items stolen from your car or something broken on your vehicle and they will say it's not their fault.\n\nLos Olivos Car Wash charges 20 dollars for a hand washed car that is immaculate and the staff is pleasant, friendly and honest. Go to Los Olivos and see for yourself.  You will never settle for the inferior work and service at Danny's ever again.\n\nI will post my most scathing review of this horrible business everywhere I can.  Someone will see it and Danny's will NOT get the business of another unsuspecting fool like me.\n\nRead the other reviews on this place.  It's stay away or you are throwing your money away plus you'll get intimidated or insulted for your trouble."
0,"The food and waiter service was good and at a good price.\nThe bad thing was the busser. Half of us were still eating when he descended on our table and started removing dishes. When my husband asked him not to, he ignored him then he muttered that was his job and even took my husband's bread plate as he was still eating.\nThe manager was no where to be found."
0,"From the managers mouth, he stated \""40 to 45 minutes is the typical wait time for food.\"" We got out appetizers after 45 minutes in and were then told that they they ran out of mozzarella, \""so I guess you guys have to to order something else.\"" I have to say we were all young professionals and the manager was not sympathetic to our concerns at all. Apparently, the customer is always right doesn't apply to this establishment. We've been here over an hour and still haven't gotten our food. If you like waiting over an hour for tomatoes, cheese and lettuce, this place is for you!"
1,Pay the extra for the VIP seats. We sat in the fourth row and had that up close experience. You also get the programs for free with the VIP. The drinks are expensive but good and they come in a P&T cup. The show is not for those wanting cheap and cheesy Las Vegas magic. The show is intelligent with a touch of politics and social commentary added in. Getting photos and autographs after is amazing.
0,"When they first opened, the food was good, but then it went downhill.\nTheir food is not fresh and every dish is socking with bad oil. \nNot authentic at all since I am from Szechuan, I know how my hometown food taste like. I can cook much better Szechuan dish at home  . Disappointed...."

I had to take the unbolted pieces  home myself and reinstall them.\nThey moved slower than slow and  between 6 of them.....they were all on breaks at one time. I actually had to rescue my vehicle from them!\nAs an ex- mechanic of twenty years, i have a keen sense of  clueless repair people and this was a graduating class. Stocking shelves....fine but trusting them with your vehicle is a no go. I have dealt with knowledgeable techs at other locations but this location really needs an overhaul. Steer clear and hopefully someone who cares in the management dept there will see this!!\nRuined my whole day !"
0,"Do not use this place! Without repeating the story of 49 bucks on top of te deal price, I just had a bad feeling about ye guys. It's one of those guys \"" you pay me 49 bucks I take care o'you no problems lifetime warranty\"" fast talking scammer. I let him and decided to slow him down and repeat that 5 windows of my choice will be tinted according to the deal no need for 49 bucks no BS. He started talking fast again and made no sense. ( can't express how much I hate that). Listen Dude pretending to look busy while you are not has only one outcome - out of business. This town runs on providing service and its mind boggling how some morons forget that!"
1,"Some mighty fine pastries and croissants with the combination of good italian coffee while located at the heart of old Montreal, makes this place a true gem!"
0,"I recently went here for their lunch special which includes your choice of white or fried rice and an egg roll or satay stick. I got their General Tsao's chicken and was very disappointed. The side of fried rice I got did not contain any vegetables and only had one piece of chicken in it. On top of that, the fried rice was over seasoned with soy sauce. They also over-sauced the General Tsao's chicken and I had to pour out the sauce so the chicken would not be saturated with it. I prefer Taiwan Cafe to this place which unfortunately is closed for the time being."
1,First Bar is a great place to grab a Stella and munch on some gourmet bar food. The music is loud and the girls are hot. Really fun atmosphere and the cool lounge seating.\n\nAll the food I ordered was very good. The BLT with avocado to the Philly cheese steak dumplings all were unique and super tasty.\n\nI recommend First Bar anytime of the day to grab a bite to eat or enjoy a glass of beer.
0,"I live in the apartments across from here so I can't help but come here when I am craving wings, it's so convenient! \nBut I'm not going to sugar coat it...the service is horrible.\nOn more than one occasion I see servers standing around talking or huddling in a corner, not checking on customers, or looking like they would rather not be there (and I'm sure they don't) but that attitude reads all over your face and body language and really turns customers off...killing the entire experience. \nNow when I crave wings I just order to-go and skip the drama."
0,"The BurGR is a beautifully set out restaurant and full of lots of sharp-looking waitstaff, and despite a lengthy line for group-dining, as a single I was able to sit right down at the bar.  I ordered one of the special burger offereings, the uber cheeseburger medium well.  I think of burger-medium well as \""no pink in the middle,\"" or passably the tiniest bit of pink in the middle as ground beef should be cooked much more thoroughly than, say, a beef steak.  Many restaurants will not even have a medium-rare burger as an option owing to the chance of food poisoning from undercooked hamburgers.  When the burger arrived 25 minutes later, it looked gorgeous on its puffy roll, with the cheese nicely melted and the beef sporting a glazed, glistening look.  But the first bite into the burger crushed my enthusiasm.  If the burger was 1/2 inch thick, then the middle 1/4 inch all the way through the burger was pink.  2 days later I am comfortable stating that the burger did not make me sick, but for a guy's whose reputation is built on quality control, how he let this burger come out of his kitchen so underdone is a mystery.  I'll be curious to see what other reports come out of this restaurant."
0,Horrible service! But  Jalapeno popper roll is amazing.
1,"A friend recommended this little neighborhood bar down the street from where we live. Russ was our server and he was excellent, recommended customer and personal favorites and provided excellent customer service. Their menu is quite extensive so lots to choose from. I got the steak kabobs and a salad and my boyfriend got the Philly Cheese Steak, both were tasty and hot. They also serve coke products which is always a thumbs up! The was another gal there also assisting Russ and she was really friendly and filled drinks, etc. The place was clean and laid back and at 9pm at night had quite a few people there which was nice to see. Zipps is probably the closest bar similar to this place without the obnoxious staff or loud crowd...needless to say we don't frequent there but we  I will absolutely be going back to LUCKY LOU's... and would recommend this place."
0,All of the excitement of eating at a cafeteria deli counter mixed with all the ambiance of visiting your great aunt at a Florida retirement home. \n\nGet ready to enjoy cold cuts or chicken salad on cold bread with as little condiments or additions as possible for three times the price you would pay if you just went to Fry's and made it yourself.\n\nThen plop yourself down and enjoy the louder then necessary ramblings of vintage Phoenicians at your choice of either the inside dining area that is somewhere between a Laughlin casino buffet dining area and a senior citizens hospital cafeteria; or the outside patio where you can soak in more lime green then is safely recomended by the FDA.\n\nAn Arizona tradition. For some reason.
1,"I love their iced lattes. The only thing I ask is that they add more \""ICE\"" to the lattes. Just a few cubes won't cut it, taste like a room temperature drink rather than something refreshing. Then again, it's only one person who makes the drinks terrible there. Everyone else is FANTASTIC!"
1,"We happened to be going by here and on an impulse decided to stop.\n\nIt's a tiny place right on the road.  They have a drive through and a walk-up window.  When we visited there were two young, very enthusiastic people inside.  They had several coffees available, as well as some Italian soda.  My wife had the coffee, I tried the soda.  We were both very happy with our choices.  I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if I could, but I can't.  And the enthusiastic service has to count for something, so we'll go with four stars.\n\nThey also have a stamp card so you can get a free beverage when you fill it."

The juiciest part of the last minute get-away, I think, had to have been the burger from DJT - the restaurant located in the new Trump International Hotel.  I'm saying, on the one hand, that the mar-a-lago turkey burger, crunchy pickle and curried (\""Donald Trump special seasoning\"") and seasoned steak fries were no joke, standout.  I wanted to write home and cry.  \n\nOn the other hand, it's also an implication of a rather tame weekend.  Hey, don't call me a liar!  It can happen.  Sure, it's Vegas, the City of Sodom and Gomorrah, where vagrants and degenerates battling clinical addictions with last weekend's poker chips still buried in their pockets fly solo to fade into the background.

We are classy (old) ladies -- the few found that weekend without teeny weeny tank tops obscenely stretched thin just barely over our buns*.  You were there with us in spirit though, especially when we spotted a softer Clive Owen-type displaying his package in speedos.  You would have had him for lunch.  For sure.\n\nNext time!

1,"My husband's family took us to a concert at the Jobing.com arena. We needed somewhere close to eat. All restaurants were swamped from concert goers, but when we walked up to the packed Yard House, they were very accommodating and we took their last table outside. Thankfully on a hot summer day, the misters and prompt service of water made everything okay.\n\nWhile the restaurant was totally full, our waiter never seemed stressed and checked in on us often. He was very knowledgeable about all the beers and even provided our table with a sample.  I tried a happy hour martini. I would never not pay happy hour prices for their drinks. It was okay, but I think if I am ever there again, I would just get a glass of wine (since I don't drink beer)\n\nAs for the food, I chose their 4 cheese pizza which was on happy hour pricing. It was 11 inches and only 6 dollars and change! What a deal and a yummy pizza to boot! I decided to add pepperoni onto it. Each topping is 1.00. My husband and his sister had burgers which were some of the best I have tried. Be warned that their BBQ sauce is on the sweeter end, but all sauces for your burgers are on the side. Their fries are those yummy thin fries that make it easy for you to eat a lot of them. Members of our table also ordered a Cobb Salad which was good and Jambalaya. If you can't make it to New Orleans, this will do the trick!\n\nI would have given this place a three if it wasn't for the pizza (especially with the amazing happy hour price) and the burgers. So I say come during happy hour."
0,"Service started out okay, but after we were served it went down hill. No water refills and after asking twice for a fork and napkins we still never got them. I wanted to like this place because of the good reviews but the service ruined it for us. We were never asked if we needed anything, we just sat there waiting for them to come to our table and towards the end we got what we needed by waving at them. Will not be back."

I called the hotel to see what was going on, after holding for 5 minutes I was td security will be up in a couple minutes. I have now been waiting for 10 minutes. I wanted to give this place a chance but it is back to Wynn for me next time."
0,I suffer from leg pain in my calf where Michael herion lasered my veins. The vein I went in for help with ( one visible large varicose vein) was left open and one of my healthy functioning vein valve got sealed shut. So needless to say the bad functioning vein is Worse. I have to live in pain in that calf area. I have to live with fear of one of the blood clots I get will be a bad one. Thanks for disrupting my life Michael Herion. Thanks for lying to me telling me vein is closed when every other ultrasound tech says it's open. Thanks for painful procedure . I should have sued.(Back in 2008)
1,"I really, really, really, like their food.  The spring rolls and Pad Thai are amazing.  I used to get delivery to my house regularly because they are only 1 mile away and delivery was free.\n\nNow though disappointingly, they are not offering delivery though they still have a big sign on their front window that says \""We deliver\"" which I think they should remove.  I called on New Year's Eve wanting delivery and when they said they did not have delivery @ the moment I asked if it was because it was New Year's Eve.  They replied, \""No, delivery driver quit.\""  I just ordered from them again last Sunday, but when I called in, apparently they haven't gotten a new one yet because they said they still couldn't deliver.  Yet, when I arrived @ the restaurant to pick up my order, the \""We deliver,\"" sign was still up. ????\n\nI have never eaten in at this place.  I've only gotten take out.  I will continue to order from them because it's the best Thai food and closest Thai food nearby.  YuM!!  Would definitely recommend though I obviously miss the handy delivery option.  It was just SO EASY."
1,"Ate here after another mediocre \nmovie choice and it was so good, it saved the day. \nThe croation (owner?) was amazingly helpful and gracious. He talked with us and treated us like family. \nHe pulled a table outside so my dad and I could sit in the sun. Even gave us sweet dates at the end of our meal to \""finish with something sweet.\""\nSanwiched in between two chain resturants, it's easy to miss, but don't be swayed. Support the small business owner and check it out. The lentil soup is delicious and my father said the same for his sausage sandwich."
1,"My favorite buffet! I came here for lunch on a Wednesday and waited 30 plus minutes (not too bad). My favorites: Kobe beef sirloin, cheese sliders, pesto mashed potatoes, spicy tuna hand roll (oookay), bbq ribs and a few salads. \n\nI was already pretty full from trying a little of everything but I had to try the desserts too. I got one of each dessert. My favorites were: tiramisu, cheesecake (semi-light and not too sweet), chocolate mousse w/ a vanilla center and eclair!\n\nSeriously try the Bellagio, I also really enjoyed the good coffee w/ my desserts. The server was nice and service was fast. Lunch is cheaper than dinner, but I think I'll definitely come back and try the gourmet dinners here."
1,ADOBO FRIED RICE. \n\nCame here with folks on the way out of vegas. price is right and food is on point. tastes just like i came from a family party (filipino style family party) and decided to get creative with the leftovers. thats how the adobo fried rice omelet  came about. soooo good. shared a adobo and katsu with lumpia and it was enough for 3 people!!! (have it be we each ordered the adobo fried rice omelet to our selves not know the size of the portion.)\n\nbetter than L&L but ranks up there with Homesyle Hawaiian out here in san diego. (MO dont worry i still prefer you over these guys)
0,My experience was terrible!!! \n\nI have to buy a bridesmaid dress for a wedding back east.\nThe style was carried at this store. I went there and 4 girls were standing behind the cash register. No one wanted to help. Then I asked where I could find the dress the girl told me a department # and told me to find it. The dept # ended up wrong and I had to ask someone else for help! She told me it would take 4 months to get it in and I needed to buy now. She didn't even know the wedding date! I was so annoyed bc I didn't end up finding any dress and  had terrible help. Id rather order online and take a chance before I went back there to search for a dept # on each tag!
1,The food was amazing! Service was great!  The chicken Marsala was everything that I was looking for. Eating there felt like eating at your Italian grandma's house. We will be going back often.
0,I'm giving this place one star and that's being nice!! I've been coming to Cesar's for so many years and this is the worst!!! I can't believe that Cesar's is allowing this place in their hotel.  It's expensive and terrible!!! There were four of us and we all agreed.  I'm writing this sitting at the Bellagio coffee shop. We are eating breakfast here because we won't go back to Central! The breakfast at Bellagio is better and cheaper. Cesar's please help and get rid of this terrible place.

0,"Same thing. Poor customer service. They don't keep schedule. Simple oil change takes 5 hours and that happens with me twice. I dropped off my car on 10 am and was promises to have it back in couple hours. As I work in same shopping center And I told that I will come after my car at 3 pm when i finish my shift and I will need it by that time to get home. But I didn't receive any call at 3. That was my luck that the other employee got sick that day and I was have to take over her. I called them at 6 pm right before they close and asked about car. \""Oh, I was gonna call you. Your car is almost ready\"". I complained on such behavior and they did not even apologize."
0,"Worst Chipotle I've ever been to. They skimp on everything to the point you think it's a joke. We kept going back thinking it was just a fluke, continues to happen. Also whether there's a line or not, the service is really slow. \n\nThey literally sprinkle everything, to the point they make a normal scoop and then pour most of it back. \n\nWill be going to the 92nd/Shea location from now on."
0,"While I must recognize that when I buy produce in a discount store, I must be extra vigilant, I have been bitten twice even after rooting through each choice in the bin.\n\nWhen I come to this store, I am looking for 3 things...garlic, onions and spices.\n\nI have yet to be disappointed by any spices I have purchased in this store, but I have been burned buying garlic and onions on the last occasion.  \n\nThe garlic bulbs in their 5 for 99 cents sleeve are generally good.  They are more expensive than the same offering at any respectable oriental grocery, but the location is closer.  The last occasion, I found that all 5 bulbs had begun to rot, to turn from the nice cream color to an opaque tan that tells me these apparently reached a temperature of over 90 degrees while in storage.\n\nThe onions I purchased on the same trip appeared to suffer the same fate.  The outer skin looked good, but on cutting in, I found translucent layers.  Peeling through the layers, the heat apparently permeated more than half-way through the onions.  \n\nI get that shopping for discount produce is a risk.  I do not respect the company that promises low prices and respectable items.  The company needs to regard minimum standards for their products.\n\nYou have lost my business.  I can only wonder about other items that came in on the same shipment, be they produce, candy or other consumables."
1,"Very clean and comfortable rooms.  It was the most modern hotel I've ever stayed at.  The bathroom was really nice with frosted and clear glass \""rooms\"" for the toilet and shower/whirlpools.  The curtains were remote controlled...simple, but still pretty darn impressive.  As with everything in Vegas, they make you walk forever.  We self parked, which was easy, but the hike with luggage to the rooms was pretty epic.  Also, the directions were not clearly marked initially.  Once we were there and checked in, it all made sense."

0,"We stayed here 11 years ago for our daughters 21st.  It was great.  What happened?  Now, it is dirty,drab and depressing.  We were promised a suite at a high level and got a room with a view of a wall on the 3rd floor.  As far as we are concerned, they went from 5 stars to 0.  No amenities, towels you do not want to use, and don't sit on the furniture-- it is scary."
0,"They're open until 8 PM for summer, so I showed up around 7:20 and it took an hour. I understand showing up right before a place closes to expect that, but it was 40 minutes before closing! One guy started cleaning the floors instead of working on my car and the guy who was at the beginning of the car wash finally came and cleaned my car at 7:56 PM... four minutes before they were suppose to close. Don't really see the point in staying open late when you care more about going home than finishing cleaning my car. The wash was fine but I always feel like I'm waiting on the workers at Freddies, rather than just waiting for my car to be clean in a timely manner. Maybe you need managers on site or something?"
1,"I loved this bar. It was beautifully laid out, could accommodate a large group of 8. It had only 2 kinds of Japanese scotch, but really how many do you need?

0,"I concur with everyone else...\n\nI understand that this is the first year of this event so I wasn't expecting things to run 100% perfect. But it was pretty bad start to finish.\n\nParking, indeed was a nightmare. After \nwaiting in line forever to get into the lot, we finally bailed and turned around and parked at the lot by Tempe Town Lake about 1/2 mile away, and just walked to the arts center.\n\nWe finally get to the arts center and see a huge line.  My sister still needed to buy a ticket but we didn't know where to go. Random people passing out wristbands, people just standing around not knowing where to go. It was total chaos.\n\nOnce we get into the event, you have to wait in line after line forever. In the 3 hours we were there, I only got to try a fish taco from Rubios, a small square of pizza from Mellow mushroom, which took extra long because they had run out of pizza. Tomato soup from Lodge but they ran out of the grilled cheese that was supposed to accompany it. \n\nDrinks I only had a sample of (not so great) wine and a beer (they were pretty stingy with the beer pour and my husband made a comment about that). There were a lot of options at the event, but the length of the lines combined with the short event time, made it virtually impossible to try even a fraction of what was there. I didn't even get to see any of the demonstrations or entertainment because 99% of my time was spent in line. No way in hell you are getting your money's worth.\n\nIt was particularly hot today and there was no water to be found anywhere. It's not really foreseeable that it would be close to 80 degrees in Feb, but you do have people drinking alcohol  in the sun all afternoon. Water should have been readily available.\n\nI don't get how this event was so poorly executed? It's a ticketed event so they knew exactly how many people would be in attendance."
1,"The reason I LOVED this mall is because when you wear a size 11 shoe, your shopping choices are limited.  Now I have hundreds of shoes but it took a lot of work to build a collection like I have.  Most size 8's can go to a shoe store any time and buy what they want.\n\nSo my point was that almost every shoe store at this mall had my size!  And not just ugly granny shoes, but really cute shoes!  On top of that they have a Burberry and a Michael Kors along with a good selection of other stores."
0,"One who knows me would think this would be my favorite place ever. Student discount, huge portions, the ability to make that huge portion even larger, a bonanza of ingredients you can pick from, tons of sauces. All of the above to me is like Mecca. \n\nSo you fill yee bowl and then they grill grill grill. Yeah, the bread is nice but I've never found the food particularly good. It just kind of tastes empty. First off when they give you your bowl its so hot you seriously cannot eat it and taste it for 15 minutes. This might seem like a good thing to be getting the food immediately but it's more frustrating than beneficial. The other ingredients again just taste kind of bland--possibly from sitting on ice all day. \n\nThe sauces, which is usually my favorite part of any meal, have never done anything for me. I have had them mixed, separate, added before, added after. They simply aren't very good. I imagine they come in huge packages which contributes to their mundane flavor. \n\nIf anyone has ever been to the restaurant Fire & Ice Grill in Boston or California it's very similar but better food there albeit more expensive because it's unlimited. I find it funny that the servers here tend to get very confused when they really don't have to do much. Never approach a table with your hands in your pockets, that's just weird in any situation. \n\nSomehow the concept of you putting together your own dish together seems to be a much better idea in concept than in reality. I guess if I was starving and it was lunch time, I could take this. \n\nI was just reminded me of one good thing though, making up ridic names on the name place-mat sticks they give you. That actually probably is the best part."
0,Not the greatest place. The barbecue sauces taste bland and the meat tastes like it's package meats.
0,"I went here for the first time, and was definitely way too overdressed. I made reservations ahead of time, but when I arrived at the restaurant, I realized that I probably didn't even need one as there were many empty seats (this was on a Thursday evening). The interior is a bit outdated and dim, and I was sitted next to a large group of women who were LOUD. I could hardly hear my waitress tell me the specials.  I ordered the trout and it was WAAAY tooo salty...and I like salty foods. I could hardly eat it. The only saving grace was the complimentary valet and our very very nice waitress. I don't think I will come here again."
0,"No leg room But cheap ticket so I shouldn't complain about that.  The amount that we paid for the bags was rediculos... so the amount I paid for my bads I could have gone with a  lot expensive air line and been more comfortable. They charge 125 to change your flight... other airlines have charge me the difference in price. The staff was really rude, not to me but to other people.  Overall not happy."
0,Beautifully laid out store but the staff is very uptight. The prices are very high and in many cases as high as a new item. To be the only consignment store in Scottsdale to not allow pictures is strange. What are they hiding?
0,"I was at MGM Grand for a conference and brought my family with me.  My conference included lunch but my family wanted to meet me here for lunch.  When I arrived they were already seated.  It was probably 20 minutes before the waiter came to the table.  He took our order and disappeared again for another 30 minutes and another 10 minutes after that there was still no food. My tea had been empty for most of the duration of my \""meal\"".  I looked at my watch and realized it had already been an hour and the conference session was starting back up.  So I left after nearly an hour having had no food and only 1 glass of tea.\n\nThe manager came by after I left and said it was our fault for not letting them know we were in a hurry.  But, honestly, does it really take 30-45 minutes to make food?  The food orders were burgers and fried items.  They don't take long to make.  According to the manager, over 30 minutes is a \""normal\"" waiting time.\n\nThe bad part is when I walked in I heard the host talking to someone else mentioning how slow business was that day.  If the service is THIS bad on a \""slow\"" day I can't imagine how terrible it must be on a \""busy\"" day.\n\nSince I didn't eat I can't evaluate the food however my family told me when food finally arrived it was cold and bland.  Some of it apparently had been sitting under a heat lamp because the plates were warm and the food wasn't.\n\nDo yourself a favor and pass on Rainforest Cafe."
1,"As MCD's go, this one is deluxe!  For families, the indoor play area is 3 times the size you normally find, and appears quite clean.  Also, plenty of seating, even booths right inside the play area.\nThe food is what you would expect, but the decor is quite nice -- even a stone gas log fireplace.\nLastly, an employee went out of her way to find the Puss in Boots toy my daughter really wanted even though it wasn't the toy of the week.  Nice customer service!"
0,"This place is terrible, i love the concept its a fun place to visit but they couldn't make the food taste good,  after all those calories. The burgers tasted so plan it was not juicy at all, i mean come on i was hoping it tasted much better than that after the advertised fat content seriously wtf, maybe i had a bad order. The the shake was disgusting it had way to much unwanted flavor after a few scoops u get tired of it , i think they could make like 20 regular shakes from that one shake. And the fries it was the most disgusting fires i ever eaten, i thought it would taste good because it was fried with lard but it don't taste good at all and smells bad . Tell me what is the point of eating so much calories if the food don't taste good why do they have to put these unwanted calorie load when the food don't even taste good. Just make the food taste good not the calorie content higher that's all they gotta do. But still i do recommend visiting this place because of the theme of the whole restaurant."
0,"Total dump.  We came to Vegas for a friend's wedding and we stayed here.  My girl and I are pretty conservative but we enjoy having a good time.  We slipped them an extra 20$ tip and for some reason they stuck us down a \""quiet hall\"" next to two rooms of college students partying and getting piss drunk.  Doors were slamming at 6am etc..people yelling, one retard got mad at his phone and broke it and it ended up right outside of my door with the alarm going off non stop.  I went out and threw the phone down the stair case.  I went to the front to ask for a room change and they did which I appreciate but this next part I can't make up.  We get dressed to go to a show and we take the elevator down.  I step out side of the elevator and almost have to spear my gf to prevent her from stepping in a huge pile of shit, yes shit, a huge pile of shit, about the size of a flat foot ball right out side of the elevator, and yes we are still in the hotel.  All of these asian tourists were staring at it all confused like it was chocolate or something, I said hey! It's shit, like from your butt, don't step in it.  We come back from the show and shit's still there, they put a cone next to it.  The next morning it was gone but there was this big crusty brown ring where the shit once sat peacefully.  You can tell the janitor had had it.  Stay classy."
1,"Really? I could've sworn I had reviewed Snapdragon already. Shame on me. I wasn't looking too much for a new salon when I moved, but after hearing about Snapdragon and passing it several times, I had to give it a try. I clearly remember the day I walked in to discuss an appointment and conveying that I needed someone that was not only good with color, but was okay with non-conventional color. One of the stylists there was actually sad she wasn't available when I was.\n\nWhen I came in and met Janelle for the first time I knew I was home. She's hilarious and so good at what she does. She's given me the courage and encouragement to add bangs to my look for the first time since I was 8 and to grow my hair longer than I thought would look okay. She's given me recommendations for tattoo artists and we can talk local hangouts and even video games. Not only that but she understands I'm low maintenance/tomboy when it comes to styling my hair in the morning and shows me maintenance that is low-key and fits with the reality of what I will do when I leave the salon.\n\nThe vibe is great, the prices are reasonable and it's now the place I call home. Bonus points because the coffee is also pretty amazing. Nothing is done half-assed at Snapdragon."
1,One of my favorite places for a long time. You would never guess this is a national franchise. Don't let the name fool you as the pickle isn't that spicy. They also have Cholula sauce and a great pasta salad.
0,"I'm a big tiki culture fan. Walking in side I got stoked the place looks like a tiki bar. I approached the bar asked for my favorite tiki drink the \""painkiller\"" the bar keep didn't know what it was. I asked for a drink menu.  No drink menu. I asked if he could make a tiki drink. His reply was baffling \""we're a dive bar bro\"" ok. So basically it's a tiki bar that serves beer. Weird right.  If you have the theme why not make the drinks? Just saying."
1,"Joy for Joyride! I'm obsessed with the food, especially the \""standard\"" taco, which is really sort of a misnomer because there is nothing basic about it.  It's flavorful and divine! Nothing here is greasy or overdone-- the food is fresh and light but very, very tasty.  I also love the carnitas taco, and the cheese dip appetizer is to die for.  It's topped with fresh jalapenos, other peppers, and tomatoes/ onions.  Soooooo yummy.  \n\nThe atmosphere is casual, fun, and very social.  I also love that it's a Mexican joint but they play great indie tunes.  No mariachi! My only complaint about the layout is the seating in the lounge patio where you wait for your table.  There are these little poof seats that put your arse right at the same height as the table and they're uncomfortable.  Yes, this is a very picky little thing but I'm trying to keep myself honest and not just give an all-glowing review.\n\nIf you love fresh and light Mexican food, give Joyride a try!"
1,"The antithesis of Starbucks...independent coffee shop at its finest.  Bungalow with slacker types on Macs, board games, and dudes with dreadlocks on their fourth quadruple espresso latte for the day (and it is only 1:30 p.m.).  Americano was unbelievably smooth, made me swear off corporate coffee for almost a week (until I had no choice)."
0,"I will not use this \""service\""  again. I won't go into a diatribe but the last insult to my sences was i reserved a ride back to the airport 24 hours in advance as they request. When my ride didn't show up and I called and asked where my shuttle was, I was told a pathetic \""I don't know\"".\nYou ask if i will use Cls again? I say  an enthusiastic \""NO\""."
1,"Wanted a brunch place that wasn't a buffet.  This place hit the spot.  \n\nI started with some coffee, which I desperately needed to keep warm.  We were seated outside under heat lamps but with the winter wind, it was still quite chilly.  I got the turkey and egg white omelet and added Jarlsberg.  It wouldn't have been as awesome without the cheese.  Glad I remembered to add it.  Didn't even miss the yolks, but probably negated any of the health benefits of getting an egg white omelet by adding cheese...oh well.  It was yummy.  And, I had to indulge in the build your own Bloody Mary bar.  That was delish!"
1,"When it comes to the dim sum: Har gow, shiu mai, sesame balls, chicken feet, pai guat, mango puddng, and all that other stuff of deliciousness, this is probably one of the cleaner, more efficient places I've been to. It's small so it's not chaotic. Plenty of food to go around and order. \n\nFor a chinese restaurant, the service is pretty decent. People are attentive enough to notice that a cart moving around isn't enough to meet all your needs... If you want to order off the menu, they got some pretty decent choices too.\n\nFor food, convenience, service, cleanliness, 4-stars."
0,"I haven't been to a Red Robin since living in Anchorage. That was over twenty years ago; I was rather young. While I didn't remember the flavors, I did remember my experience fondly. This goes to show that memories as a child can be skewed somewhat. The interior decor is an over-the-top tchotchky reminiscent of a restaurant one might find at a theme park, i.e. Disney World.  On the meal for this visit:\n\nClam chowder\nPrime Rib Sandwich\nFrench Onion Soup\nChicken Pesto Pasta\n\nI am a very big fan of foods that are layered, but in RR's case I must make an exception. When that layering includes being overseasoned and lacking flavor something is wrong. The people people cooking the meals must not like the flavor of the base ingredients with as much seasoning salt as they use. I was dehydrated for quite some time after having finished my meal. \n\nI really don't understand how I could have liked this restaurant as a child, especially considering I can get better tasting items out of a can or the freezer. Stouffers makes a better chicken pesto pasta at a much lower price. There are just too many other better restaurants in the area to consider returning."
1,Good food ordered the flame broiled cheese burger with fries and the guacamole BLT. Delicious!
0,"So your probably wondering, why would anyone bother to yelp a McDonald's.  I'll tell you why! I love Mickey D chicken nuggets, and as often as I eat them, I have never been to a McDonald's before that told me they are out of Sweet & Sour sauce!!!  Seriously it's like WTF! How do you run out of Sweet & Sour sauce!!!  With the amount of preservatives in it, I don't think the stuff ever expires, so you should have a crate of it in back just in case!"
0,Took this firm four tries to fix my air conditioner last July.  Wouldn't have cared except for the 115 degree temperatures at that time.  Would recommend avoiding this firm at all costs.
0,"Bland and slitely overpriced. This is what I would expect Mexican food to taste like in Canada. Also, with your meal you get a tiny helping of chips, seriously there may be 10 whole chips in the basket. If your in a pinch I would go across the street to Taco Bell!"
1,"This has got to be one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. I can't even count the number of times that I've been here (or the original Arcadia location) and it's consistently great! \n\nThe bruschetta is flavorful and fresh (make sure to sign up for their emails, you get a coupon for free bruschetta and they don't bombard you with spam), their salads are delicious and inventive, and I always love their \""soups of the moment.\"" \n\nThe wines are a bit on the pricey side, so definitely check out their $5 glasses of wine before 5 pm. I love to go on a Saturday afternoon and get a glass (or two) of their regularly $13 sparkling Sauv. Blanc Emeri. So light and refreshing.\n\nThe service is good; it's definitely a trendy, hipster vibe but the servers are not pretentious or annoying. And their patio is dog friendly! I came in one afternoon with 3 people and 3 dogs, thinking that they would look at me like I was a crazy person and turn us away, but instead they sat us on the patio with a smile and even brought a water bowl for the pups. That's definitely the way to get a dog lover to return! \n\nThe only downside is how crowded this place is - but you can't fault it for being so awesome that everyone wants to eat there - so I try to only go at off times. If you haven't been to either Postino location yet, it's a must!"
0,"A co-worker I was with summed up our lunch crowd succinctly with, \""This feels like the Chinese equivalent of Waffle House.\""  The food is bland, the d\u00e9cor is generic with smooth jazz playing over the speakers, and the food is served with a knife and fork - you have to ask for chopsticks.  There are much better Chinese food places within walking distance of this place.\n\nI only recommend Jade Palace if you like your Chinese experience without any hint of ethnicity."
1,"LOVE GIANT HAMBURGERS!!! You get a giant hamburger, diner style...you can get it without the bun (they call it the diet plate) if you are trying to limit your simple carbs.  The staff is friendly and fast.  And you can get your burger rare if you like!!  Can't wait to go back!"
1,"Oh Bobby Flay, you truly deserve to be an iron chef.  Had the NY steak and it was so so delicious.  Hubby had the rib eye and just the look of it made me want to eat it all.  The corn thingy side was so good, as was the mashed potatoes.  The fundito was really good too, as were the chicken skewers.  Not really crazy for the tamales though.  But regardless, the service and the food were so good, and the price wasn't as bad as I thought it might be so go Bobby!!!"
0,"Came in here for lunch as we were hungry and in between the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. This place is closer to Luxor.\n\nOrdered soup, pizza and 2 drinks. The soup was okay, but sadly had a beef stock when it didn't need one. Ordered the veggie pizza. It was very soggy and laden with cheese even when we asked for light cheese.\n\nThe server was nice, but for the price and quality of pizza at a pizza place, I'd rather go somewhere else."
0,"Absolutely terrible, do not order from this place. Worst pizza and longest wait time ever"
0,"No longer my favorite as they limit their wifi on weekends! The two stars are for the wifi, not for the coffee. While everything else stays the same, their service for providing a cozy study spot is no longer excellent! Two stars for the wifi, as they still provides wifi started at 2 PM."
0,"Went solo for seafood night. There has been a change over time at the M and Studio B. Less tables, tables sit dirty for Long periods of time. You stand in line worse than any Disney line. Only 3 items seem to be added for seafood night. Oysters, crab legs and not King crab and shrimp. Everything else is their regular buffet. So for these items you pay a great deal more. My family refuses to stand in line which is a long time. Last night there were only 14 couples ahead of me. It took over an hour before I got a table. Do not think I will be back until something improves."
0,"Can you say, LAME!!! LOL. So there was a semi long line waiting for Surrender to open. Look in the line, NO good-looking people! I'm not mean or anything, don't mean to sound like a bitch but it was like the rejects that couldn't get into XS. We came in and it was completely DEAD! Drinks are super overpriced here, especially for being Vegas. I would come back to the Encore beachclub but I will definitely NOT be coming back to Surrender. Oh and another thing, tons of old ladies trying to dress and act young here and i'm not talking about the hot cougars either! If you're into that, then this is your place!"
0,"The worst, NON Mexican food I have ever had. The worst food I have ever had. The restaurant is nice enough, the staff nice, too, but the food, BAD!!!!! Tasted more like Indian, but did not look like Indian!!!!!! AVOID!"
1,"I have never loved going to dinner with my mother in law so much. She treated us to Hecho's and everything about the night was perfect. Excellent and attentive service. Spectacular food made exactly how asked for, and delicious appetizers! Any tourists that go through the MGM MUST stop and try it. The rolling guacamole cart (made directly in front of you) is to die for! Just a wonderful night with a full thanks to the Hecho's staff! Can't wait to eat it again!"
1,"Absolutely LOVED this place. Great beer, great atmosphere, great bartenders who are knowledgable and actually CARE if you like the beer and what you think of it!!! All of them do. Kiltlifter is awesome!!\nWe were looking for good beer and not necessarily good food but this place has both. We tried the chicken wings and the pita and spicy hummus. Both were very good. The bartender had asked my husband if he was afraid of spice and my husband told him he likes to hurt when he eats spicy. So the bartender brought us out a habanero sauce that's made in house... you have to ask for it. My husband was delighted. \nWe will definitely come back! Loved this place on so many levels."
0,"Went to have some brunch at MTO it is a neat space, with minimal decorations that kept our attention. Being from restaurants we always watch the operations of the kitchen and the wait staff. The first red flag we saw the expediter eating French fries in front of the line, in front of all the customers, gross. You have an open kitchen yes but duck in the back and feed your face. From the waiter he said his name was Jose or something like that. We asked if the chef was on duty and the waiter also said no, probably why the whole kitchen was a free for all and slow. First we ordered the pancake dippers. It was a plain over mixed pancake with bacon in it sliced into strips. Nothing fancy. Then we watched the expediter \""Jose\"" walk over to a table and shake someone's hand with his gloves on.  We then ordered our sandwiches. I had the tree hugger. I think if I ate a tree it would have had more flavor than this. It was a good concept and that's all the good I can say about that. It was a quinoa bun two patties. That had absolutely no flavor at all. It had some kind of sauce in the middle and a few leaves of spinach and a few small tomatoes. It had the potential to be good if they used a little seasoning salt or some herbs or anything that could flavor the cardboard patties. The coffee was good. The hangover burger we ordered was cooked perfect and was juicy. If we were going to come back I would order the burger. It  The fries are bag fries nothing special. We ended up paying fifty dollars which seems very expensive for a mediocre brunch. It is Comparable price to EAT, with less flavor in the food."
1,"Great course, Fair to all abilities and in great condition. Only bad thing is the kitchen closes at 4"
1,"Really good coffee. I stopped in for the first time on a Monday afternoon and ordered a hot caramel latte with almond milk and a ham and cheese croissant. Everything  except the service was great. Let's just say the place didn't put off a very welcoming vibe.  Perhaps I came in on an off day? However, the coffee was so good, I will give it another try...there is always something to be said for quality :)"
1,"I was looking fr a good Indian in Montreal; after living in the UK for 6 years I was looking for something authentic, familiar dishes well executed; and the good service you can find in your local Indian restaurant back in London. I think I found it - the lamb saag was great (and had the consistency I was expecting as opposed to some other Indians restaurants I've tried in Montreal) , the rice was perfect, the veggie curry was also delicious. Our only complaint was that the meat could have stewed a bit longer in the curries, but really it was still delicious. I ordered over the phone and 10 minutes later it was ready. Will definitely go back and eat in. Can't wait to try more foods!"
1,"Wow. Love this place. We had the soul food plate with chicken fried chicken, collared greens, and beans on rice. We could have drank the white gravy from a cup it was so good. The service was fantastic and she answered all our questions. (We're as pasty white as it gets and this one of the first soul food experiences for the family.) One tip: the portions are huge so you can share. Highly recommend."
0,Honestly my fav place for buffet at Vegas is the Wynn....similar in price but the food served here somehow for me missed it's mark.....and I am more into main meal as opposed to dessert but If I had an amazing meal I will be tempted to go further and try something sweet......well after having a few things here including their crab legs which were too salty...... I just couldn't continue on with dessert...... I was done.\n\nThe happiest place for me in Vegas is the Wynn......
1,"My van broke down and I needed a tow real fast because I had my kids with me in the heat. I looked up towing on my phone and just happened to pick Leyva's. I am so glad I did. I spoke with Chris and he was very nice and helpful. The driver was there within 20 minutes and was also so, so nice to me and my kids. He was very clean and professional and courteous.  The whole experience was better than I have every had with a towing company. I keep their card in my wallet now and gladly refer them."
0,"I just got my membership here and will be canceling it today. The customer service is absolutely horrible. The sales guy is demeaning and would not help us out at all with the guest pass, and then passively decided to send us what we were asking for AFTER we had walked out. Like many people reviews said, all they want is the money and unwilling to work with their customers in a respectable way."
0,"As the story goes, in 1999 (or thereabouts), three guys from New York wanted a slice of pizza and couldn't find one.  So they stopped at an old gas station on Central Avenue in the Plaza Midwood area and created a \""hand crafted\"" slice, with real mozzarella, rich tomato sauce and fresh ingredients.\n\nSome seven years later, they have opened five other locations, including this spot on South Boulevard, and are still selling pizza by the slice (you can get whole pies, but the pizza \""buy\"" the slice is a major draw).  Sure, you can find a slice of pepperoni, but let's face it - why would you bother?  You can get pepperoni anywhere.\n\nIf you're at Fuel Pizza, get something different, such as the Fuel Extreme (basically a meat lover's dream) or the Barbecue Chicken pizza. Both are good and have the aforementioned fresh ingredients - but I would probably argue that they are representative of New York style pizza.  That's not to say that it's bad pizza.  It's quite decent.  but there is better pizza to be had in the city, and there is even better New York style to be found if you look for it."
1,"First, I love Yelp for leading me to this place!!\n\nI felt like I walked into this little hole in the wall restaurant and someone's Thai grandma made me lunch. It was superb. We had the summer rolls, Tom Kha soup and yellow curry fried rice. If we end up on this side of town again, this place will be high on the list!!"
0,"We went on a Sunday when they had some specials going on. $6 wings and $6 chilli fries. They also had all taps for $2. The place was not to busy and we were greeted promptly and sat at the bar. \n\nI ordered wings and a Diego Burrito. The wings were good. They were large and crispy but not a lot of flavor. I had the garlic chorizo sauce, I guess I was just expecting more of a kick from either of those two ingredients,. The burrito fell apart as soon as my fork dug into it. Again, not a lot of flavor. Actually, the burrito was just bland. The special price on the wings was worth it but the burrito was not sadly. I will go back to try some different things and update this when I do. \n\nThe saving grace of this establishment was the bartender. Very friendly and super upbeat. That being said check out their daily specials. They have some good drink ones and it would be worth it to go. Also a large selection of tequila and margaritas."
1,"Our one \""must stop\"" place in Vegas. No matter where we stay, we have to have a Grimaldi's pizza. This branch is right between our two favorite hotels, so...score!\n\nPerfect thin crust New York pizza. The wait staff has always been friendly and fun, and the food is worth a 3.5 hour drive. Get a basic pizza and stop with all the California crap. Ranch dressing for a pizza? Please. Good beer, good salad, excellent pie. What more do you need?"
1,Super good food and staff it's extremely friendly. Love coming here every time I'm in the area.
0,"Really bad service, waited an hour for my food, water barely got refilled. I don't know why we had bad service while the restaurant is half empty. All entrees didn't get to the table at once and one order was messed up."
0,"\""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" \nFrom the Cathay House of about 2 or 3 years ago, no less. I wonder what happened? Cathay House used to be a go-to for my friends and family, but somehow the overall quality has been declining, and this last visit made us realize that. \n\nThe dishes now have simple, fundamental issues with them, like very thick dumpling skin that sticks to the dish, and vegetables that are not very fresh and crisp. The tea was clearly oversteeped. The highlight of the meal was actually the tripe, which was very clean and had great texture. Have prices creeped up over the years? We racked up a $70 bill for what didn't seem like very much food, especially in between all the limp veggies and half-filled dishes.\n\nThe service and cleanliness have also gone downhill; where I feel like Cathay House used to clearly be the nicest dim sum place in Chinatown, I can no longer say the same. While the servers are fairly patient and accommodating as usual, one of our party observed that some of kitchen staff don't perform the required hand wash after a bathroom visit, and that they were talking on their cellphones in the kitchen! I'm not sure what to think, between being disappointed, and being hopeful that Cathay would return to its former glory, but I do know that for the first time we'll be looking for a new dim sum place."
1,Newly minted McDonald's. Double drive thru which they actually utilize. You definitely get through the line faster.
1,"Driving through from the Grand Canyon back to San Diego and found this place thanks to Yelp. It was delish! We had the Bosnian Soup, Stuffed Cabbage, some kind of pickled salad and the large sausage plate. The bread was amazing too! If you are in the area, you should definitely venture to this spot."
0,The staff doesn't listen. I have been to this location twice and my order was messed up both times. I don't know what it is but they don't listen. They are always very disorganized. Quick serve usually means you should get your food within a 3-8 minutes. In my most recent trip I waited 25 minutes for my food and it wasn't even busy! They need a better staff. Their staff shows no care for the customer. There's a 5 guys across the street and an In-N-Out 1 miles away. Your service would be better AND FASTER at one of those burger joints.
0,One word.\n\n\n\nRisky.
1,"If you were to base 7 Cees as a restaurant it definitely will get one star.   However this place is known as a grease spoon dive.  That is exactly what it is and by far the very best dive diner that I have ever been too.        \n\n Jeanie is great.  She will be your greeter, your hostess, your waitresses, your personal cook, your bus person, and your cashier.  whew!!!!  Jeanie is not a jeannie in a bottle. She cannot snap her fingers so that your meal magically will appear in front of you.  She is the only person that I have ever seen working in there and you will definitely need time to wait and wait for your food.\n\n Her cooking area is quite small.  Trust me you do not want to question her about where your meal is or how much longer it will take for you to get it.   Jeanie does swear like a sailor, but in a quiet mild manner and NOT like a raging lunatic.  When you come here you will have to except every swear word constantly flowing from her mouth.    Trust me I  hate it with a passion when people swear, but with Jeanie, it is okay.\n\n But with Jeanie, you have to know it is coming and it will be coming in full force.  However while Jeanie will swear like a sailor she greets everybody with a kind and sweet heart.  She will make your order the way you want it.  Beware!!!!!  The portions are huge!!!!!   The coffee is endless. The prices are very reasonable. \n\n So why only four stars when it should really be a five.  Well as I mention Jeanie's swearing like a sailor is part of the 7 Cees experience.  I can deal with hearing damn, mf, shit,  etc.  I cannot stand hearing my best friends name being used in vain or as curse words.  When people say Jesus Christ name or God followed by the d word.... I get upset."
0,"My husband and I love ice cream, who doesn't? And Cold Stone is our go-to place. It's conveniently placed right next to Chipotle and Jimmy John's. \n\nThe ice cream is great, as usual. Lots of goodies within the ice cream.\n\nOur biggest problem was the customer service. The last time we went it took SO LONG for them to ask what we wanted. There was only one person in front of us in line. \n\nThe place was also dirty as can be. There was stuff all over the floor and we couldn't find one clean table to sit at. It was disgusting. We almost decided to go sit in the car in the parking lot and enjoy it! \n\nNot the best Cold Stone I've ever been to. It's a shame - we love their ice cream."
0,"Food and salsa were all let downs.\n\nThe place echos with loud noise \n\nIt's a tiny place with harsh lighting.\n\nGo to Taco Bell and be happier\n\nWe brought our own tequila and bought their sour mixer . We didn't care for it, too much sugar and not enough limes ..then after bringing our own liquor and paying for mediocre sours mix, they were charging us $6 for a glass fee for 2 of us.\n\nThis is not a swanky place, they don't even have a liquor license ! After a bad and loud meal, this $6 was ridiculous.\n\nThe waitress stands over you to finalize the bill with an iPad . They have the tip percentages spelled out for you . A bit awkward."
0,"Decent sushi, OK food overall. But it is Expensive. \n\nVast overuse of a sweet miso sauce. \n\nFor the price, tho, skip it. There is way better food at the Bellagio."
1,"The environment is fancy and service holds some oldworld ways, but it's a place you can feel relaxed in. Maybe too relaxed- everyone got to witness me be break all decorum and go at it like a pig face. Hours after dining here I am still sitting food comatose, yet I'm thinking about food- Mimmo's food that is. \n\n We were greeted by Gino himself and promptly taken to our table. The maitre d' starts off the old world hospitality I appreciate and sadly don't see much anymore. He pulled out grandmas chair, helped her out of her coat and hung in on her chair neatly, helped hang her bag and pushed her chair in. \n\nStarted off with:\n\nSalsiccia Calabrese $8 (1 House made spicy sausage grilled, served withpeppers and tomato sauce) -  I love calabrese and it's not like I can buy it at the supermarket and love when it's made fresh. Lovely, a bit spicy and had a nice grill crispy char. Very simple, but sometimes that can be bad when you don't know what you're doing. This is definitely for sausage lovers. \n\nArancini al Tartufo $14 (Fried rice balls with the essence of truffles with truffled cream sauce)- we had these at a Yelp Elite event and were trying to hock so many so fast I had ball burns....on my tongue...errr.... the truffle is definitely present so if you love that flavor profile, it's the star. \n\nI had their \""House Specialty\""- Osso Buco $41 (Veal shank braised in red wine reduction served with farro)- pretty yummy. Definitely didn't disappoint...it's a different variation than how I make it at home or the one I order at my favorite Italian place in LA, but a good version. I like farro, but I think I prefer risotto milanese still with my buco. \n\nThe BF had Risotto Aragosta e Tartufo $36 (Italian vialone nano rice, lobster meat, seasonal truffles, mascarpone, truffle oil) Very nice. It was a large enough portion that he couldn't finish. Had a good amount of truffle (so not for someone who doesnt like that flavor since the are not shy about truffles here) and plenty of lobster chunks. It's rather rich of a dish that I definitely want to order this again, but I think the BF and I should half this and another more delicate dish to balance it. It's decadent and one of the best risottos I've had. \n\nMom and grandma in law shared Costata di Manzo $42 (18 oz. porcini rubbed bone-in prime ribeye) We love Austins steakhouse and they think this was actually better in flavor. I think lies the difference in that it's natural grass fed beef and not conventionally raised. I took a bite and it was butterknife cutting soft. They also got two sides ($9 each): Mac N Cheese was lovely and I don't even like mac n cheese much and green beans was perfectly cooked and lightly flavored. \n\nNotice- in everyones food I'm putting MY input....I did say I was pigging out. It backfired in that I couldn't eat dessert later, but the food was lovely that it's worth sitting here having \""the itis\"". It's my birthday so I can do what I want- Haarmmppfff. It's not like my family was gonna finish their food on their own. \n\nOur server is a professional, in a personal way. Attentive throughout, friendly in a sincere manner, informative on the dishes, good suggestions. Kudos to Edward (I'm starting to make a point to find out names of those who do their work well because a little kudos is deserved) - thank you for a lovely service and giving us a experience.\n\nOn a random note that highly impressed me- they didn't forget the beer! Sure, they're known for their wine collection, they have cocktails and spirits covered, but their beer bottles are impressive. They have imports that are definitely a direct import because no distributor has these beers. I wish I didn't see that after when I was looking at the dessert menu (which is attached to the cocktails,spirits,  wine by the glass menu....bottle wine list comes out in the beginning of the meal so make sure to ask for this drink menu too) or else I might have debated to try to go for full comatose with a Nuova Saison. \n\nWe went during the locals appreciation night and it was an AMAZING deal for that experience. We are already talking of coming back (BF wants to get the rabbit, I would love to have the tripe. Yes, it's a guilty comfort for me) possibly taking in their wine pairing experience and doing a Wednesday antipastini late night UYE in the future. This place reminds me very much of my dear Il Buco in Beverly Hills (my favorite place outside of Italy) and has the quality of homey yet indulgent recipes I've had the privilege of trying (and learning) in authentic Italian homes. My Nonna would approve of this place and she knew her food. \n\n.I can see this being a favorite Vegas establishment where we can take our visitors and come when we want to indulge. 25 years in Vegas and I sure hope there is 25 more."
0,"I am definitely not a fan of Prive but I think it's because it brings out all the worst things about going out in Vegas. Yes, I am a newbie to Vegas clubbing but I'm not a newbie to going out to giant clubs and amazing parties and this one just sucks. All they try to do is get tons of money from you. I came with a group of 20 and we all had wristbands to get in for free but they insisted that they would not let us in unless we bought a table. This was at 10:30 at night, right when the club opened up and there was barely a line! All they wanted to do was sell us tables at $375 a bottle with a 2 bottle minimum! Finally, we worked out a \""deal\"" and they let us in but the guys each had to pay $30. Once we got in, the place wasn't bad. It's huge and we didn't have to wait long for drinks but the drinks are again, extremely expensive. I paid $14 for each cocktail I bought. The music isn't anything special and it gets ear-killingly loud by the end of the night. I actually had to leave because I couldn't handle it any longer at around 2am. Then I spent the whole next day trying to coax my ears to feel normal again. I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon."
0,"You get what you pay for. It's cheap and it looks cheap. \n\nMy friends and I headed to Vegas on a whim and nothing was planned, so we needed a room and fast. We called multiple places that were either booked or too expensive, so we finally checked in here.\n\nThe beds aren't comfortable and there really isn't anything special about this place, but it's a good choice if you are in Vegas to party and aren't planning on being in the room much.\n\nIt's not directly on The Strip but it's not far from it. We walked and it took us maybe 15-20 min."
0,"worst customer service experience ever. \nwanted green curry chicken $10.25 but it only came with 3 types of veggies, two which i wanted to replace with two other types. with his strange logic, waiter said $2 extra to replace the veggies??? i was already like uhhhhh\n\nso i took another minute to overlook the menu and saw veggie green curry for $8.50. i asked how much to add chicken to that, he said $1-$2. so i did that instead. \n\nmenus need to be updated! my friend ordered panang and menu said it had 4 types of veggies so she got it. dish came out and it only had zuchinni! really? she told the waiter to take it back. \n\nwill not be coming back! krung siam across the street is way better!"
0,"The staff is welcoming and knowledgeable at this decent-sized whisky shop north of the main drag from the Castle.  As you'd expect, they have a large selection of whiskies in bottles of various sizes.  The reason I'm only giving this two stars is that I discovered they are also the most expensive whisky shop in the area by far -- at least of the five I wandered into, including four that are actually on the Royal Mile (where I expected prices to be highest).  A full-size bottle averaged 7-10 pounds higher here than elsewhere; it was just disappointing to discover."
0,"One of Wolfgang Puck's Express sandwich and pizza chain spots, located in the LV airport. \n\nWe shared the chicken aioli sandwich ($10). Average ingredients; it's all about the sauce. It would have been much tastier if the bread bun was crispy and well-toasted properly, but then again it is a fast food service. Don't think Puck would have been satisfied."
1,"Amazing place. Service and food was off the chain!! A  MUST HAVE IS THE FISH BURGER....& THE LAVA CHOCOLATE CAKE...I'll take a picture of it before it's all gone lol. Love this place even with the long wait\n\nI had the Emily (the waitress, loveedd her earrings, and she was really courteous, informational & just a complete pleasure) & Ryoji (who periodically filled for water, who btw is complete eye candy)"
1,"Stayed here a couple times, loved the pool, loved the SELF CHECK IN.  Try finding that in Vegas, people stand in line in for over 30 minutes, but you can easily walk over to the self check in and get your room with no fees.  Did I mention no hotel fees $15 per night... Not at Flamingo.  Ohh and its located right next to the monorail, so if you don't want to walk the long strip or are a great and got heels, stay here.  You are also in the middle of the strip."
1,"I found this dentist office through Yelp and the awesome reviews were spot on! :) Dr Amy and Kristen were great! \n\nDr Amy was so attentive and didn't try to \""sell\"" me on anything like other dentists in the past have. She has a genuine interest in your smile, health and helping you save money. Most \""new patient appointments\"" are simply the x-rays, poking and prodding but they did all of the exam PLUS the cleaning all at the same appointment. To me, this was awesome and made the most sense instead of just scheduling to come back yet again just for the cleaning which is what most other dentists have done in the past in my experience. \n\nIn addition, I was able to watch \""Friends\"" while getting my cleaning done with headphones on so I could zone out and not try to not make eye contact/have an awkward drooly conversation while they are in your mouth. Side note,  why is it that dentists want to ask you questions when they are all in your mouth? Ha!  :) That really helped take the ease off and made it a much more pleasant experience. \""Friends\"" makes everything better after all ;) I would highly recommend Dr Amy to everyone- super nice, professional and helpful.\n\nPS- See Dr Amy, told you I would write and happy to do so! Keep up the good work!"
0,"I was all ready to post a detailed - and fairly good - review of the Rio that I had written on the plane home from Las Vegas last week.  Then I got home and looked at the room charge;  Rio over-charged me more than $100, and this was after I caught an incorrect $135 spa charge on my bill during check-out!\n\nAttempts to fix the situation have failed- even after their marketing company replied to a tweet I posted saying the wanted to help/fix the issue.  I've had to file a case with my credit card to have it reversed- that's not good service Rio.  (I'm also going to file a claim with the Better Business Bureau.)"
0,"Do you valet more often than not? Do people ever call you \""narcissistic\"" or \""pretentious\""? Do you go at lengths to be sure people know that you are the wealthier than they are? If you answered yes to any of those questions, Capital Grill is where you should eat lunch tomorrow. \n\nThe wait staff is friendly and they all have exotic accents, but you can tell their jobs aren't easy. \""I said pink in the middle! Not charred, not red. Pink, you imbecile! I knew we should've brunched at the country club, dear.\"" \n\nFood is good for those who can flip the bill but not nearly good enough to charge what they do."

0,"I read a few mixed reviews on this Restaurant but overall I got the impression that it would be a nice meal with good service.... \n\nI left the place extremely disappointed the food was ok, although the combo of fish and sausage was just a little odd and the service I just found to be strange. Our waiter was attentive but he had strange mannerisms that really made me just want to finish my food and leave as soon as i could.... which i did! \n\nWould i go again.... nope never!"
0,"Service was terrible and the food was mediocre.  The wait was long (despite beating the bro-crowd on the weekend) and the waitress seemed confused and overwhelmed.  I think she was schizophrenic.  After 30 minutes she tells us that the cook had messed up one of our orders so we had to wait another 15 minutes.  I ordered a veggie omelette and it was cold and stale (including the toast).  Nothing spectacular for my taste buds.  My friend's Egg's Benedict was cooked horribly wrong, i.e., the eggs were hard-boiled.  And it wasn't covered with any hollandaise sauce but instead what appeared to be a streak of brown gravy.  I hope it was gravy. This place is in the heart of old-town and I was expecting great food by talented chefs.  I'd choose Randy's over Morning Squeeze, unless they improve soon."

0,"Saturday 9/21 a group of 14 people had reservation for dinner at 7:30 P.M. \nWe were seated in a few minutes.  We had very poor waiter service he did not come over to us for at least 15 minutes. Dinner was served one hour later for most guest but ours was served 15 minutes after the other people  We placed our orders two of us wrap with chipotle\nIT was so hot our mouth burned, lips were on fire.  We had shared one piece of the wrap with our friend and he could not stand the fire in it.\nSo we final got our waiter and he looked at us like we were crazy than finally the owner came over to us and scold us like a school child [didn't we know what we were ordering].  We did not order anything else as he qualify as the rudest guy in town.\nYou will see this restaurant on restaurant rescue.\nP.S. he charges us sir charge on the meal that we didn't eat\nSTAY AWAY"
0,"Made a reservation for a party of 8 and on our way to the restaurant, I received a call from the location on scottsdale road confirming our reservation.  I explained that i was certain that i called the Biltmore location.  Once i arrived the Biltmore, they did not have a reservation and did nothing to accomodate our frustrated party of 8.  Won't be going back anytime soon."
1,"BEST FROZEN YOGURT EVER!  I should have known that a warm tempered climate would know how to freeze the stuff properly.  Yogurt Jungle had a fabulous flavor offering with cake batter, ny cheesecake, eurotart, pomegranate, mango, dulche de leche, and the list goes on.\n\nThe topping offering was also way above average.  I went to fresh fruit heaven and went HEAVY on the kiwi, pineapple, blackberries, and strawberries; that makes the outing a healthy one, right?  \n\nI can safely say there will be no need for Vitamin C or Calcium supplements for the remainder of my visit, a daily dose of Yogurt Jungle will do!"
0,I will first off state I will never be returning to any Bevmo. \n\nI decided to place an on-line order on the bevmo website to make things more convient. After deciding what I wanted it gave me two options either pick it up in the store or have it delivered. I chose to pick it up. I was then prompted to enter my credit card information. This was going to work perfectly as my girlfriend needed my debit card. \n\nI drove down to the store after work to pick up my order. When I arrived the first gentleman asked for my credit card first thing( not even my ID). I let him know that I already paid on line and I showed him the printed confirmation page I had with me. He said let me get the manager and walked off. I was left standing there wondering why he even needed the manager as he did not explain to me. The next gentleman came up who introduced himself as the manager. He told me he needed the credit card. I explained to him why I did not have it. \n\nI asked why they had the ability to order on line and pay using a credit card if I needed to bring it in with me. He told me so I didn't have to stand in line. Well this makes sense except with one huge flaw! Why not have the website setup to place the order and then require the payment to be made once you arrive at the store. \n\nI work in the credit card processing industry and from a business standpoint there there should be no reason to charge the card on line if you require the card to be presented once they arrive. \n\nYou pay twice as much for a keyed transaction on line than if you were to swipe the card in person(which makes the most sense since your required to bring it with anyways). I was refunded the money but guess what now I cannot use that money for 24-48 hours until it has been released back to my card which completely screwed me out of leaving and purchasing beer later. \n\nThis is a completely unacceptable way to  operate an on line service that is put in place for convience when it does the complete opposite and does nothing to speed up the process.
1,"I loved it!  Totally raunchy and hilarious.  The stunts and acrobats were pretty amazing, but watching them done 10 ft from your face gave it an incredible perspective.  The humor will have you rolling on the floor.  Don't sit in the front row unless you want to be a part of the show and made fun of.  Hurry and see it, I heard it is gone at the end of the month!"
0,Ordered the roast pork menehune. Looked like TV dinner.  Not coming back. The Siamin was horrible.
0,"For someone who straddles the line between sometimes craft-er, this store can seem vast and confusing.  There's rows and rows of baskets and bedazzling jewels and paper and...oh my...scrap booking!  When I want to find boring old felt....it's like...where do I start?  \n\nI'm in a hurry, as always, and I rush in and the first thing I look for is an employee.  No one to be found.  I could call out and my voice would come echoing back.  I run between rows of paper, wood and gosh darn scrap booking....no felt!  Where do I find felt!  Where do I find an employee!?\n\nFINALLY, I find one after 15 minutes of wondering around.  She's incredibly nice and leads me to the felt.  This is not the first time I've been hard up to find help.  I tell her she was hard to find, and she tells me that they're \""low on payroll\"" and can't have any one the floor BUT HER!  In that WHOLE store, JUST HER!  That's ridic!\n\nNot a month ago I was, again, in a slight hurry and stood in line for about 15 minutes to check out, with 2 employees at the register and 6 people per line, I gave up and walked out.  \n\nHey Michael, do you pick up what I'm putting down?  You're not making any money because your costumer service SUCKS....in fact, there's no service to be found!"

1,"Mojito pitchers and yummy tapas!!!!  One of the best bday dinners EVER!!!!  I recommend the bacon-wrapped dates- I was VERY skeptical, but damn... So good!  Don't forget the grilled potatoes!"
0,I wouldn't recommend this place. The bar hasn't been cleaned in who knows how long. The coolers are disgusting. This was a terrible experience! If I was an owner I'd be appalled at the condition this place is in.  Absolutely disgusting. I should submit the photos I took to the health board. Filthy establishment.
0,"I saw the good reviews on yelp and thought I'd give it a try. I will never go back. I had a slice of pizza, topped with meatball and mushrooms and a half order BBQ wings. The meatball looked like it was frozen meatballs and you can tell the mushrooms weren't fresh like they were from a can! The BBQ wings were unevenly warmed up. There were spots that were hot, some spots that were lukewarm, and some spots that were cold. I ended up not even eating all of it AND I got sick! I can't believe I paid as much as I did for that food."
0,Hotel was okay. Not the best or nicest Westin I've been too. The room was loud even though I was elevated from the street on floor 16. They've got a big problem with the fire alarm (flashed green light all night through) and I can't stand the dripping over head shower....\n\nAnd I will never understand why hotels charge for wifi. That's basic wherever you are these days. Get with the times!
1,Great beds! Good prices. Ok service .. Huh? Duh? Wha? I work at a tanning salon and last year at band camp.....
0,"Do not go here for a check up.  They made me wait in the room for an hour before the doctor came to see me.  And she just walks in like nothing is wrong.   The doctor sat down and just asked me a few basic questions about my health history and squeezes my legs and arms and says \""you seem healthy\"".  I ask for a blood test and they send the lab work OUTSIDE of my insurance network.  A month later, I get a bill for 1500 bucks for a blood test -____-.   Save yourself the money and the headache.  Go elsewhere"
1,"I LOVE Dunkin Donuts. Do I think they have the best doughnuts? No! Every time I come to Vegas, I always make a stop at Dunkin because there aren't really any locations near where I live. \n\nService, the service is fairly friendly and efficient. You get what you want, you pay, and you're out. I like that. \n\nI always come for their Keurig K-cups, they have a more robust taste than their regular packaged coffee.\n\nBack to the donuts. I like that they have seasonal flavors like pumpkin. Their donuts aren't overwhelmingly sweet. The donuts are a pretty good size, so you don't feel too guilty for having 2 or 3 with your cup of coffee."
1,"I really liked it and it's become a new place on my list of places to go around campus.\n\nThe owner and staff is friendly and helpful.\nThe food, price and specials are good.\nNice, personal vibe, I love the atmosphere, great hole in the wall place that makes you feel like you're not in Vegas anymore (or in a cookie cutter corporate chain- yay for variety).\n\nTried the steak, fish and potato tacos, all good. Rice and beans are quite good too (for just being rice and beans).\n\nYum :)"
0,"We visited this location on a Saturday afternoon and we didn't have to wait to be seated. Our waitress was pretty nice at first. My husband and I each ordered one of their sandwiches with a side of fries. The fries were very greasy and mushy. They were not appetizing at all. I left most of them on my plate. The sandwich honestly looked like something I could have made at home and it didn't taste any better. As we were eating, we noticed the place began to get a little more crowded. That was when the service from our waitress got bad. She never came back to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything. She simply came by to give us our bill. It was like she was rushing us out. Very rude. I will not be going back, the food really sucked and the service really sucked."
1,"I got to Vegas super early and was craving their Queso Fundido so I went hoping they'd be open. I had to wait long enough to lose a few hundred dollars as they don't open until 11:30. \n\nI had the Queso and street tacos as normal. I also thought I'd be a tough guy and order the salsa Diablo. They were nice enough to replace it with the house salsa after I swallowed my pride. I think they may have noticed I was sucking down ice water like it was keeping me alive. \n\nAnyway, you won't believe this. I still don't believe it myself...\n\nTowards the end of my meal, the manager came by and recognized me from my past yelp review!  I was kinda freaked out!  But how awesome is that!  She had messaged me previously asking how they could improve their service so there was correspondence, but wow!  I was impressed. She walked by and did a double take and was like are you, did you, are you the guy I talked to who left a yelp review?  \n\nShe was really pretty. Lol. So I may have gotten a bit nervous after that!\n\nRegardless, great food as always, and the Queso Fundido with chorizo is simply fantastic. The service was great. I had multiple people take care of me.\n\nI will go back for sure, maybe even again on this trip!  \n\nYou don't find sincere personal service like that at very many places and it is appreciated. That's how you gain loyal customers. They gained one today!"
0,"I tried this place because it is close to my house, but I was very disappointed in the Pho Ga (chicken pho). The broth was suuuper weak, no flavor at all. I guess I'll have to trek my way to China Town to get some decent pho because I wouldn't waste my money on this place again."
0,"RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!!!!!\n\nThe good stuff:\nBrilliant art installation in the lobby, even though it stopped working a few days after I arrived \n\nBeautiful room and a secluded pool called the Bamboo. \n\nOn with the bad stuff:\nMy room and those of others in my party had bathtub poltergeists that would cause a single jet or two to go off in the night. Not making this up. And it was LOUD. \n\nThe nitwit that checked me in never bothered to activate my key cards. So I sat in a sweaty puddle of exhausted traveler in the hallway for 30 mins before someone let us in and then it was still somehow our responsibility to go down stairs and get it all sorted. The only person who was actually helpful during this whole ordeal was the housekeeper who rang down for someone to come let us in. It was truly miserable.\n\nLet's see...it was overpriced--I'm sorry, but you can't charge that much for a hotel just because you're next to the Bellagio!!! And at least the Bellagio understand that there are certain times of day when you lower your table minimums. The Cosmo had $25 blackjack at 11 AM on a Sunday. \n\nAnd many of the other guests strongly resembled the cast of the Jersey Shore. Just FYI."
0,"Went here for drinks and dancing, after dinner service hours. Only in town for a week so might as well hit this \""dance club\"" up.\n\nThe bar downstairs was nice, not packed, regardless of the line to get in outside. Not worth the 5$ cover to get the shortest, and weakest drink I've had in a long time.\n\nGo upstairs, sweaty smelly wanna be club. All I could smell was the dudes puke on the floor next to me at the bar. Head down. Literally unresponsive. Pointed him out to the bartender. Not sure if she handled it, cause I drank my drink, and left.\n\nMaybe come earlier, for food. Only because I haven't had it yet.... Lol"
0,"They changed the menu!  My server tried to explain the items they no longer had.  When I complained and said I would come less often (i usually come twice a month) my server, Christopher R, decided to just walk away after chirping \""It was changed well over a month ago\"".\n\nThe pizza I decided to order was horrible.  Needless to say based on the change in the menu and the horrible service that I won't be going back anytime soon."
1,Food and service was outstanding. Very flavorful and presentation was exceptional. Unfortunately the front end folks had an attitude because of our appearance (dress). If you can get pass that every thing else is worth the trip.  Thumbs up to the food and service. Thumbs down to the arrogant stiffs  up front.
1,"Went to Lazy Jane's for brunch this morning (around 1pm). \n\nGet there as early as you can! They ran out of a number of dishes and the scone selection was sparse. Also, they needed to restock the water glasses, and they ran out of forks, apparently due to a dishwasher malfunction. Eating the seitan hash with plastic cutlery is a little challenging =) \n\nBUT The food and atmosphere are still amazing. And I had the vanilla almond coffee. OMG! Yum!"
0,"THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!!! all the portions are crazy but everything is amazing. I had the Komomo, which is a meatloaf sandwhich, and it was amazing! and I can't stand meatloaf. BUT the service is HORRIBLE!!! the host is really slow but the server is even slower!! I understand it vegas and its busy but we went when it wasn't busy and she still didn't have a clue how to do her job. She had like 3 tables and messed up everything. The prices are ok and the FOOD gets an A++ but the service gets a ZERO."
0,"Overall I rate Starbucks very highly so for me to write a below 5 or 4 star review there must be a problem.   I spend lots of money for coffee as this is my only \""bad habit\"" as I like to say.  I know my coffee and I know my americanos.\nFirst, I ordered my standard grande americano.  I lifted the lid and it looked like drip coffee.  Americanos if done right need to have to what appears like a thin layer of coffee froth called crema. Its not only about the looks the crema shows that it was brewed right and the full flavor is in the cup.  I indicated very politely to the barista that it wasn't done right and it needed crema and that I wanted another made.  She had no clue what crema was and asked another barista/employee.  This time while she was not very rude but rude enough she said that\"" if I make another one it will come out just like that\""!  I asked her if she knew what crema was and she looked at me as if I was some kind of a demanding crazy man.  She got back and got somebody else because supposedly I had created a BIG problem.  Now I am feeling uncomfortable.  I asked for my money back since I see an unwillingness to make another one.  The now even newer person perhaps a young on duty manager said that I was yelling while I was not.  I might have spoken louder than normal but it was warranted and I was by no means yelling.  I told her I am not yelling and she said yes you are! She is now making everything worse! At this point I had it.\nIt seems that the cocky attitude that some people in the medical field have like doctors carry over to these employees of since  this Starbucks is located near UMC! WOW!\nI frequent Starbucks hundreds of time a year and like I said I know my americanos. The one near my home ALWAYS makes them right!  \nI called Starbucks 800# to complain and their store will hear it from their district manager.\nI even called back the store itself to let them know whom I had just called.  Granted the person that picked up the phone which might have been the manager was very apologetic and knowledgeable of crema but he didn't seem knowing what they do wrong while brewing these drinks either. No issue with him.  \nThey need to figure out how to make americanos right and be more accomondating  to their costumers and not making one feel bad if all their asking is for a better drink!"
1,"We did not stay here, only gambled and hung out. We decided to check it out because we heard they had $5 minimum black jack tables all night. Well they do, but they only have two so good luck trying to actually play at one of them. We ended up at a $10 minimum roulette table and had a great time. My husband played and I watched, we were there for maybe 30 minutes and were offered one drink, the service seemed slow. We then headed to the little pizza place right by Coyote Ugly, I can't remember the name but it was delicious! It was actually better then pizza I had in New York City! We then headed into Coyote Ugly, we got a \""special pass\"" so in before 9 you get free admission all night and 2 for 1 drinks till 9. We then headed back out to the casino for another hour or so, and then got to cut the line to head back into Coyote Ugly. Overall we had a great time here, the casino and bars are a really good time!"

1,"I've used this hotel for years through work and have always had a positive experience.  Free WiFi, great front desk staff, big rooms and easy access to the great city of Madison. \n  I tend to be very hard on hotels but this one always leaves me satisfied."
1,Best Club Ever! Very Impressive. Beautiful people everywhere. My only complaint was the lines were way too long (over an hour wait). Even if you had bottle service you were having to wait. We managed to get right in. Great music and dancing. Blows PURE away.
1,Big Delicious portions!
1,"The El Diablo drink was great, also enjoyed the 3 little pigs sandwich"
0,"Weak Mexican food. Along the lines of Chevy's. I may be a bit biased when it comes to mexican food having grown up in SoCal, went to school in SD and now have access to the Mission in SF. \n\n\nI didn't necessarily need/expect a great meal here, but this stuff was just flat out bad. I was STARVING when when I got there, ordered fish tacos and couldn't even finish them...not because I was full, they were just that bad.\n\nThe service was decent and the ambience is about what you would expect with a name like \""Loco Patron\"". \n\nGo here for beers/shots only."
0,"Had the eggplant parmigiana sub tonight, one of my favorite fat splurges. Very disappointing, dry cheap bread, out of the box eggplant, and not enough sauce, although the sauce did have a fair flavor.\nService started promising, garlic knots almost as soon as we sat down, but went downhill from there. Had to ask for utensils after food arrived. Server asked how things were then walked away without waiting for an answer, leaving my dirty dishes and empty water glass behind. Waited for check that never came, finally walked up to counter to pay. And I still have a bad taste in my mouth from the not so fresh parsley sprig."
1,"So I work in the air park and get pretty tired of the selection and the prices. \n\nSo I see a place opened up called Jimmy John's. I had no idea what it was, with a name like that I was expecting BBQ or a hot dog place, but this wasn't the case. \n\nIt was sub sandwiches. TASTY and cheap sandwiches at that. \n\nSo I strolled in there today at lunch rush, I placed my order, I had 2 sammies and a pickle to go. I ask them if they are going to call my name or a order number, the guy at the register says they will call out my sandwich. Ok. \n\nI go over to the pick up area. They call out my first sandwich, and just toss it on the counter, I ask for a bag, a girl behind the counter barks at me to just grab a bag (there is a pile of bags behind the counter with in customers reach) So I grab a bag and bag up my first sandwich. A few other people have now gathered around the pick up area....My next sandwich is called out w/ a pickle. As I go to reach for it another guy reaches for it as well....I almost had to play rock, paper, scissors for my lunch as he had ordered the same exact thing....they REALLLLLLY need to have a better system, like say, call out the order numbers that the register generates right there on the receipt vs. calling out what sandwich is up, just on the slight chance that two people ordered the same exact thing. Lucky for him he was a gentleman and let me take the sandwich and pickle and wait for the next one to come up. \n\nI would have given them 5 stars, but the whole sandwich pick up system is such a cluster f*ck."
0,"This place has a hefty grey haired man with quite the crappy attitude.With his Horrible customer service skills, it's no wonder he's stuck working in this tiny gun shop crammed in the corner of the tiniest strip mall. Just went in on a whim, to ask a question about a particular rifle, and he acted like a complete DICK. I felt very uninvited in the store, and wouldn't spend a dime in this place nor 10 seconds of my time."
1,"I've always wanted to go to the basketball, football, and baseball hall of fames, but I doubt the curators of those fine establishments would let me shoot free throws into the original peach baskets, kick the football from the first Super bowl, or play catch using Ty Cobb's mitt.\n\nAt the Pinball Hall of Fame, however, the game's history is alive and well in Las Vegas, near UNLV. Pinball machines from the earliest days of gaming are not only on display, but available to play. It's an incredible and impressive sight: rows and rows of games, some nearly a century old and still in perfect playing condition. The curators of this museum take pride in their work and it shows. \n\nMy inner teenager was giddy with joy at being able to play 8 Ball Deluxe and Pinbot again. I pumped a few quarters into the Playboy machine before I changed another dollar for the KISS machine. I tried my hand at games I've never seen before and I played pinballs that were released before I was born ... and even a few that were released before my parents were born. Absolutely amazing.\n\nThere was a good selection of video games too: Joust, Galaga, Miss Pac Man, Vs Excitebike, Paperboy, etc. I even saw a Pong machine tucked away in the back as well as a hockey foosball game where you can relive recreate the Miracle on Ice. Being able to see a Tron machine in excellent condition is an extremely rare thing these days, but being able to play it AND post the high score? Yes, my day was made. What an awesome experience reliving my youth, one quarter at a time. I cannot recommend this place highly enough."
1,"I finally got a chance to taste what everyone has been talking about! Really fresh food, really good food and lots of it. \n\nI had the veggie quesadilla, a side of beans and a roasted jalapeno. The veggie quesadilla was simple - cheese, avocado, lettuce and peppers - but it was still tasty. I'm a sucker for beans, and although these weren't the best I'd ever had, they were still really good. I chopped up the jalapeno and added it to the beans. \n\nThe 3.5 star rating that America's Taco Shop currently has (as of the beginning of January 2011) is not at all representative of the food and service that you'll get at the Shop. Go anyway, eat and be happy!"
1,"I'd fly back to Vegas just for the Truffle pasta. It was a pasta of the day, and what a glorious, glorious day that was. Er, two days (it was THAT good). I cant even remember anything else we ate (it was all delish) because we were in a heavenly like, orgasmic state. We might not have even talked the entire meal, other than about how great the pasta was. It's very likely at the top of my last meal on earth list. I love you, truffle pasta. You are the pasta of my life."
0,"This hotel was really only one step up from Imperial Palace... which isn't saying a whole lot. I admit, I was apprehensive from the start as I wasn't the one choosing the hotel. I mean, who really wants to stay in a giant pyramid? But whatever. The pictures of the rooms online were grossly exaggerated. Talk about photo shop!! The bed was painful to sleep in. The door looked like it had been all but kicked in. The bathroom door was pretty beat up too. It looked like there was water damage on the curtains. It also smelled dank and musty when we first walked into the room. The elevator is very strange too (it slopes with the shape of the hotel) which is not so fun after a few cocktails and 6 inch heels. \nAnd can we talk about the buffet here?! YUCK. I don't understand why they wouldn't want to be competitive with surrounding hotels offering incredible buffet selections. It was almost inedible. \nI wouldn't stay here again... \n\nAlso- the dealers at the tables are SLOW. Snooze-fest."
0,"How did we end up eating at a 3.5 star pizza place? We have an Entertainment book, opened it to a random page and a Round Table Pizza coupon was there. Being not too far from the house, we made the trip.\n\nWe had to wait for almost 10 minutes for the guy working the register, and two of the kitchen staff to finish flirting with the girls in front of us that came in to pick up an order that was called in. The staff could not deduce which order was theirs, out of what looked like a very limited number of options. An offhand comment was made that they should sell the girls \""a big bag of 'oregano'\"" - this will become more relevant in a moment.\n\nFINALLY, they finished the debacle that was handing off three pizzas and collecting funds for said food.\n\nWe ordered, had to repeat ourselves multiple times as to what we wanted, the guy behind the counter had the toughest time listening/comprehending/pressing buttons.\n\nWhen our food finally came out, we were wondering about the logic behind their pizza. The wife ordered a specialty pizza that had all sorts of vegetables and some meats in melted cheese. For whatever reason, some of the vegetables were just thrown on *after* the pizza was cooked.\n\nMy BBQ chicken pizza was ok, messy as all could be, but tasted alright. \n\nWhen it came time to rinse my hands of BBQ sauce, I made my way back to the restrooms. Remember when I said the staff's comment earlier would be relevant? There was this very distinct, strong and pungent smoky smell coming from the kitchen area. Wonder what that could be. Not really, I know what it was, I've been to high school and college.\n\nOnce that hit our nostrils, it became clear why the staff could not concentrate or use basic logic to figure out which order to give the customers.\n\nHere we are three days later and my wife is still trying to get to where she feels better. Amazing how eating at a place can have an immediate and long lasting effect on a person. \n\nNeedless to say, we won't be going back to Round Table Pizza, this one or any others. For that much money per pizza, there are many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, better options."
0,I ask for a soda water with a lemon and got  it with a lime. Ask to have my steak medium and it was under cooked...medium rare. I expected better service and better food for the money. They recooked my sirloin....didn't give me a new one. I ordered sirloin oscar so the bernaise  sauce was not replace thus the dish was ruined. I will not be back and wish I would have gone to Longhorn Steakhouse.
0,"Although Jennifer was cordial and a pleasure to do pre-planning arrangements with (ie: how many of this/that, what we need, etc.) I was not very impressed with how she conducted business on our wedding date. Our wedding was 150 people, in Beaver Dam, and in my parents back yard. I supplied everything for them (aside from mixing utensils). \nMy father expressed concern regarding underage drinking and over-intoxication. I understand he had requested that IDs be checked for those appearing to be underage. This is not an unusual request and was part of the reason we'd hired a bartender to handle alcohol rather than have a liqueur buffet. However, requesting the ID of my grown, adult guests repeatedly throughout the night became an issue. By \""became an issue\"", I mean that myself, the groom and our parents were receiving countless complaints from our obviously-adult guests that they were being refused service at the bar or they felt as though they were treated rudely. A specific situation would be she requests to see the IDs of my grandparents (they're 70+ years old) or our aunts and uncles who are well into their 40s. In fact, looking back at my guest list, there were 16 underage children (not teens) at the wedding. The issue persisted throughout the evening, concluding in my father and the groom having to tell her to ease-up 3 different times. \nI understand that we hired her and her colleague for the better part of the day. I understand that we hired them both over 2 mealtimes. I made it a point to pass-the-word along that vendors were welcome to help themselves to a plate of food before the caterer left. However, I did not expect that she would serve herself food prior to all of the guests eating and seat herself amongst them. That was not professional in the least. I didn't notice it, but my guests did and they've brought it up to me numerous times. \nBiggest issue that baffled me was her telling guests (my bridesmaids, groomsmen, and our parents included) that we were all out of various sodas and other alcohol by the end of the night; however, when cleaning up the next day, we carried 20+ 2-liters and 10+ bottles of alcohol out of the ice trailer.  We did not run out of a single thing other than cups. I do not understand why she would tell people we were out of those items. A specific example, we bought a ton of diet soda because there were 3+ guests that are diabetic. One of those guests approached the groom at around 10p stating he was told there was no more diet soda. We had some; we're still finishing 2-liters that were left over today. \nShe refused service to one of my dearest friends while the groom was ordering her a shot. We bought a special $50 bottle of gluten-free vodka exclusively for her that went to waste because she over-asserted herself. She then proceeded to give the groom himself a mini-sobriety test when he was ordering (ie: asking rapid-fire, unrelated questions, paying close attention to his answer/response time). Guests complained to me about her rudely refusing service unless they brought their original cups back. I understand we ran out a few times, but we had enough (and continuously brought her more) that she didn't need to be turning people down. \nOn the other hand, we received nothing but compliments regarding her colleague's composure and professionalism throughout the night. In conclusion, hearing the feedback we've received from our guests since the wedding I was unsatisfied with the quality of service she provided. I will not be recommending her business to others."
0,"We stayed at the Rumor for my bffs bday and it was a fine stay but we accidentally left some things behind in our hurry to get things tidied up .... and upon going back to ask if the stuff had been found (which should most likely be immediately after cleanup since they were the next people in the room) we were told it hadnt shown up as yet. We checked out yesterday. So why wasnt it turned in immediately after clean up? and I know that we left it because I didnt unplug my brookstone charger to put in my bag and no one checked the closet for the clothes that were there before we left. So this bums me out. I hate forgetting things when staying away from home but its even more sad that when you leave it at a hotel, then its just gone forever because the staff gets to keep it (or whatever the arrangement is for lost and found). So I had to post this comment here because I believe that the lost and found is as much of the experience as anything else we were catered to and if someone drops the ball like this, maybe something will be done to better serve from this aspect.\nThank you,\nTonya"
0,"Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \""Are you working?\"" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \n\nIt's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it."
0,"I really wanted to give this place a better review...I mean its my people...I'm from an island culture, this is supposed to be an island inspired spot, but is was the service that stood out to me...\n\nThe food is good but not great...Loco Moco, good, but its not that hard to make and for 8.25, thats a little pricey for that dish. The Adobo Fried rice is good, but similar to a lot of Filipino Adobo at any other Filipino Restaurant and again is pricey. Also, the portions are very average. Its a ten to 12 dollar meal that doesn't really fill you up like island food can, so bring a bag of chips or get ice cream on  the way home  Eggs benedict are good and there are a lot of different styles of it so that cool to try. Red Velvet pancakes are good if you really have a sweet tooth. $4 dollars for three strips of o-k tasting bacon....oh no.....\n\nThe service, its a little slow...its gets really crowded, and the servers can be pretty smug...Half of the servers are really hospitable and the other half seem annoyed. We were a big group and we waited about an hour...\nMy friends Waffles came out so late, that he asked to cancel them...for Waffles....there explanation was that the waffle machine wasn't working correctly and they wanted to make them just right...He cancelled but they still gave it him when our meal was basically done, and they still charged him...really...and they were just O-K.....\n\nI love the ideas in this restaurant, but I expected way more and have had way better food, at a better price with better service.  It was Island style Las Vegas food...."

0,"This Walgreens has the busiest parking lot ever no matter what time of day it is packed! Kind of weird as the store seems empty. It is a standard Walgreens but this one sells liquor. The store is old and run down, the staff seems a bit distant. \nI would never go out of my way to shop here, but it does get a pass for convenience."
0,"Nothing here really blew me away..  Yeah, it's pretty cool that they brew their own beers and they are located on Tryon but... eh.  This spot is one step above an Applebees.  Dont get me wrong, I kinda like Applebees.  Just dont expect anything amazing.  I would suggest sitting outside and enjoying a nice day.  That might make it a little better.  I would also suggest you try the artichoke/crab dip.  That was rather delicious.  I would say, give it a try but know.. There are much better places in the city.  Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M."

0,"I came here on a Sunday night, nobody was there and I was actually his first customer. Hookah was overpriced for what it was and we paid before we even got the hookah. It was 30 dollars and you have to order at least one drink. He did tell us that we had to wait 10 minutes for the coals to warm up even though it took around 20 minutes. We smoked hookah for about 3 minutes before it got harsh and we had to practically hunt down the employee to fix it. Overall, it was a \""whatever\"" experience. Decor was beautiful and they do have a full bar. However, I won't be back. If you want good hookah and easy prices, you're better off going to Tempe."
0,"If I could give a lower rating then one star I would. I just ate at the Coco's in Scotsdale Az. It was one of the worst ideas I ever had. I went with family we had 2 kids with us a baby, and an 8 year old.\nMy brother and his girlfriend ordered stake, I ordered a chicken sandwhich and sweet patato fries, the kids had mac and cheese, and a pizza and fries.\n\nEverything was COLD, all the sides cold, the kids food was cold, and the stakes were undercooked! I would never advise anyone I know to eat here, we told the manager, and all he took off the bill was the stakes, not my sandwhich, not the kids food, and I'm pretty sure we were over charged. The staff wasn't mean about it but I know they could have done better then just taking 2 things off the bill, since everything was cold."
0,The price of the rental was more than our airline ticket.  This location is where all of the rental cars are held.  It was hard to find and I will not rent from them again.  At least not in Vegas.
0,"I brought my dog in who was very sick and not doing well.  They ran a few tests and charged me about a thousand dollars to tell me my dog was old and was going into kidney failure.  I am a medical professional, I asked if this could possibly be an infection and they said no the dog was just old and had about a month to live.  I took the dog to my vet first thing monday morning and the first thing she said was the dog had a good chance of having a serious kidney infection and may respond to treatment.  Isn't that what I asked!  After 5 days of antibiotic treatment the dog is brand new and back to normal.  I can't say enough about my vet, she is awesome and thorough.  As for Animal Emergency clinic, they are boobery and nothing more.  A monkey can start and IV and give fluids, I paid HUGE money for medical management of my dog.  I do anesthesia for a living and if I performed this incompetently I would get my ass sued off for sure and I would deserve it.  I guess vets have the luxury of never having to live under that ax, and they also have the luxury of making a whole lot more money than I do evidently by what they charged.  Humans don't even get charged this much for simple IV therapy!  Totally ridiculous, take your dog, cat, parrot whatever to the U of I, they are expensive but your pet will be alive when you leave.  This place is a joke to the highest magnitude!"
1,One of my favorite spots in Charlotte for sushi! Their sushi lunch buffet is delicious and garlic noodles are a must. Try out their mixed drinks as they always have something new and fresh! The sushi is very fresh and the atmosphere is unique in Charlotte. Their new lounge and jellyfish tank are must-see while enjoying Pisces' food.
1,"Best chicken fingers I've had.  Other options in the Valley can get close (i.e. Raising Cane's) but this place is unparalleled.\n\nThis is a really small place, about as local as it gets - so feel good about spending your money here!  Talk up the owner and bring your friends - he'll hook you up with extra sauce or an extra finger."
0,"Good location, good for a cheap breakfast (to compensate for all you spend on dinner around here!). But super slow service."
0,"I can't even believe I'm reviewing a Buffalo Wild Wings. You are all witnessing what can only be described as a low point in my Yelping. Ugh, ok, let's just get this over with.\n\nFirst of all, why did I even come here? Because it was Friday night and my family wanted to go out and my dad hates any place with live music, crowds, noise, and \""lots of energy.\"" So Buffalo Wild Wings is the perfect place to go if you hate people and fun, basically. And my brother wanted to go here because they have trivia, which by the way is also not fun because if I am one thing I am fucking competitive and I hate losing and will go out of my way to try to ruin the fun for everyone else if I do. Also the game itself is full of either esoteric questions or totally obvious ones and if you wait long enough they give you the answer. Total bullshit. \n\nOh so the restaurant itself I'm pretty sure is segregated. The hostess insisted that we sit at the bar even though the front dining area had plenty of tables open because she said there were only two waitresses for that area and they were already busy. So we walked through there and pretty much everybody was black. The bar had some people in it and (you should expect this if you've been reading carefully) they were all white. Probably a total coincidence. I'm not really sure but I'd guess Yelp might frown upon such a nonchalant accusation of segregation.\n\nThe only other time I've been to a Buffalo Wild Wings was in high school when I went with my friend Katie and these twins, Greg and whatever the gay one's name was. All I remember from that was the twins were really hot and I had a thing for Greg and didn't find out until January when I visited Katie in Brooklyn that a) Greg is her roommate now and b) he totally had a thing for me, too. So when we reunited we hella made out and I know my ex-boyfriend doesn't read this but if he does I might as well come clean about also making out with 3 other guys early on in our relationship because that's what you get when you date me for 5 months and refuse to acknowledge me as your girlfriend, asshole! This entire paragraph has nothing to do with this restaurant but whatever if I want to use Yelp as my diary I DAMN WILL. \n\nSo anyway we ordered like 25 wings for the table and I'll just cut to the chase, they sucked. I asked the waitress if they had anything that they didn't deep fry and she replied, \""Everything is fried.\"" So I ate all this fried greasy food and felt horrible and my old college/post-college/occasionally current bulimia habit kicked in because I just didn't want that shit in my body. That is how bad Buffalo Wild Wings is. Fuck now I wish I would not have told my mom about Yelp because she reads my reviews now I guess. She said some of them are funny. SOME OF THEM?? She also says I'm \""too sarcastic so that I can sound edgy\"" and to that I say you may be right but Yelp reviews are the only things keeping me from pulling the trigger on the Beretta I put to my forehead every night before bed, so just let me do this the way I want. Man, that was really dark. Now THAT'S edgy!\n\nWow what the hell was I even talking about? Oh yeah, I didn't like the wings here."
0,"It's pretty hard to screw up Mexican food, right?  This place manages to do it quite well.  I recently went there with a large group (8 of us) to celebrate a birthday, and I was embarassed that I was the one who recommended it.  I had never been to the one in DC Ranch, but had walked past it at night and it looked like a lively joint, so I chose this one because of the central location.  \n\nWhere do I begin?  The club soda in both my cocktails was flat, I ordered lemons and got a lime,  and the chips were the absolute worst I have ever tried...like tasteless pieces of cardboard-no lie.  It was the first time I can remember not gorging on chips and salsa before the main meal.  The salsa might have been OK if I'd been able to get one of the nasty chips in the thimble-size bowl.  I just gave up!  My chicken quesadilla looked like they had warmed it up in a oven, the tortilla wasn't browned, the edges were dry, and it was just plain boring.  We all ordered different dishes and not one of us was happy with our meal.\n\nOn the positive side, the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere is kind of fun if you're into rusty signs and plastic fish hanging from the ceiling,  They also have a large patio that was well-misted and at some point they had a singer/guitar player performing.    It was a relief from the horrendous  soundtrack of classic rock from the 70's that was annoying me all through dinner.   I was a teenager when those songs were current, but seriously,  who wants to listen to The Who sing \""5:15\"" in a bar in 2008?\n\nUnless you just want to hang out on the patio and drink a cerveza, I wouldn't bother with this place.  There are too many other great Mexican restaurants in town."
1,"The decor is older and minimal and the place is small but they make up for that in taste and great price. I love the lunch special chicken pad thai. It is delicious and fresh. It comes with soup of the day, fried or steamed rice (I like the fried), an eggroll and little salad."
0,"I have been meaning to write this review for a long time. My husband and i got married at the Venetian resort, which is an amazing hotel, and we continue going there every year. The night before our wedding we and our four friends decided to go to this cozy looking Italian restaurant mainly the atmosphere seemed very nice and we love Italian food. \n\nHowever, I ordered a pasta dish not sure which one, with chicken and it came without, which I instantly noted to the waiter. Of course the waiter was apologetic, went to the kitchen to ask for the chicken, which I found very strange, perhaps even more strange when the chicken came out in a bowl, they had cooked the already frozen cooked chicken in cream in the microwave, so basically I was meant to add that to my pasta, It was hilariously disappointing, and our friends weren't very impressed about their pizzas either, and barely touched them."
1,"I had a really good experience there today....  I'd never gotten a crown before and was nervous, but the staff and doctor were very understanding and actually it wasn't that bad.  I don't get the feeling I'm being upsold like so many other dentists I've been to in the past, just doing what's needed.   Plus, they have massaging chairs in the waiting room.  Lol."
1,"I really enjoyed my visit to Edinburgh Castle. It's definitely a must-see in Edinburgh! The price was totally worth it. The architecture is majestic in itself but the fact that the castle is atop a hill makes it even more magnificent. The prison is probably the most interesting part despite the unpleasant smell. Also, the walk along the beautiful Royal Mile right outside the castle is a treat in itself."
1,"A Friend of mine really wanted to come here for dinner so a group of us (guys and girls) decided what the heck.  This place is an awesome sports bar/restaurant as big flat screen TVs were everywhere.  The girls here were no Hawaiian Tropic models, but they weren't bad looking either.  One of them had stuck up attitude and that is a big minus in my book.\n\nNow to the food.  The prices were not too bad, but we didn't know what to expect. I had the Crackling Pork Shank.  It was effin HUGE! I don't care what others may have said, but it was good.  If your Asian, Filipino, Pacific Islander..whatever, you'll like this.  We ordered other dishes which were all good, but this one stood out for me."
0,"I will always remember this place as the sight of the worst meal I ever had. I tipped 25% just so I wouldn't feel bad as I'm writing this. \n\nService was unsatisfactory. We were not offered a hello, a place to sit or even acknowledged for that matter.  When we finished our meal I was craving mochi but was instead brought the check by the other waitress. \n\nThe meal was a shitty bowl of seafood udon with overlooked, sparse muscles and inedible mixes of shrimp and octopus (both were overcooked and rubbery as well). I also had the worst spider roll to date. \n\nDo not eat here if you are seeking good, fresh and clean eating environment. \n\nEat here if you want to punish yourself."
1,Love this place. Used to be called Casa Bianca (along with 2 other Casa B locations in Madison which are now closed). Pizza hasn't changed since the Casa Bianca days. Big and Floppy slices. So good.
1,"Ate here for the first time this morning at 11:15 a.m.  As A.B. guessed, they are primarily a catering gig.  There were only two other parties there. The family ordered off of the menu--eggs Benedict, patty melt, and 2 your way.  I ordered the skillet, as advertised on the window.\n\nI've eaten at most of the breakfast joints around town. Add this place to the list of good ones. Potatoes and eggs were perfect, the portions are huge, and everything came out about the same time. Service is attentive, and friendly.  Check out the pics of the Benedict and skillet--we'll be eating this for tomorrow's breakfast!"
0,"Everytime I've gone to this location, the smoothies were absolutely HORRIBLE. They were always too sweet. I tried to like the smoothies, i gave it so many chances, but each time I was disappointed. I think it's just the location because I've tried a Tropical Smoothie on Las Vegas Blvd and another in Summerlin and they were excellent. It's just very inconvenient to go to those locations because this one is the closest to where I stay.\n\nThe only good thing here I would say is the food. I've gotten a couple of wraps and some salads here and they were pretty good."

0,"I decided to try somewhere new for lunch today and my girlfriend suggested we head to this place. Checked Yelp and was excited to see a few good reviews. We arrived and were seated quickly by a very nice hostess.  Our server came over and while he was friendly and attentive he smelled terrible.  Every time he walked by our table he trailed a tear inducing odor. We still weren't ready to completely give up on the place despite the server's poor hygiene and decided to order:\n\nChicken Bruschetta\nA small Pepperoni Pizza\nand some Fettuccine Alfredo\n\nThe Chicken Bruschetta came out first and looked fantastic. The presentation was excellent but upon biting into it we learned it was made entirely from salt. The sliced chicken on top of it looked as if it had been bought frozen and just thawed and tossed on top.\n\nWhen the Pizza and the Alfredo came, again both looked amazing, we were setup for even more disappointment.  How you screw up Alfredo is beyond me but it seemed like they forgot to add cheese and just gave us some noodles in a pool of condensed milk.  I never thought of pouring milk over noodles for breakfast but now I know that it wouldn't substitute for cereal.\n\nNow onto the pizza, I'll be honest it I liked it. A little bit heavy on the cheese but if we had just gotten this take out and not sat in to enjoy the scents I probably would have given the place a 4.  However even pizza is extremely hard to choke that down with a scent that can best be described as urine soaked hobo. We paid, left, and probably still tipped better than we should have.  I wouldn't recommend this place, if the servers can't be bothered to shower and wash their clothes once in a while who knows what goes on in the back."
1,"Expensive.  But worth it.  Beautiful fabrics, totes, clothes, throws, etc. Friendly staff.  Definitely worth a trip inside for a look!"
0,"Great service!  Carolina brisket tender but flavorless, coleslaw lacks any flavor at all. Onion rings downright bad, buffalo shrimp very decent. Sweet tea is good and always kept full. Buffalo dip not so good. Turkey platter bout as dry as you can get it, be sure to smother that baby in as much sauce as you can!  Mac 'n cheese is acceptable, add a little sauce to it while you're at it. Fried Milky Way on the way, but can't see how that can be anything but delicious. Great atmosphere, substandard food.\nUPDATE:....it's been 25 minutes waiting for dessert, although with just us and 4 patrons at the bar I can see that they may be slightly overwhelmed. Oh wait! Here it is, let's jump in and see how it is.....as expected, hard to mess up deep frying a candy bar. Not bad dessert."

1,"If you haven't stopped into this joint yet, you have to give it a shot. It used to be Screwballs, which was a ratty dive, but the new owner has completely renovated the property. It now has a small restaurant seating area, large open bar area with table seating as well and TV's everywhere. The menu is very nice and while I haven't tried a lot of their items, they have a good selection of food, they have awesome burgers! Their Sausage over Penne Pasta was also great.  The staff there is also very friendly and they're open 24 hrs. ."
1,"This adorable bakery focuses on desserts on a stick like cookies, pies, whoopie pies, but primarily cake pops that bring on the goodness!  They had a pretty nice assortment of sweet treats to choose from when we went there.  Snickerdoodle, Chocolate Mint, Gingerbread, Egg Nog, and Banana were some of the unique cake flavors along with Vanilla, Red Velvet. I cant remember all what was in the display cases.  However I sure do know they have alcohol infused ones. Guinness and the Wine Moscato ones I tried when Dip Sticks was at Las Vegas Distillery during the Yelp Spectacular Spirit Spree.  That one was my favorite so I was happy to see they still had a few Moscato ones left on a late afternoon. They also have cupcakes but just a small selection and they had some cute cakes on display used for special orders. \n\nThe cake pops sweetness wasn't too overpowering at all. They were moist and the flavors were spot on both Moscato, Guinness and also the Chocolate Mint ones I tried.  The crisp outer candy coated like shells on all of them were real colorful and had swirly designs. It melted in your mouth when I took a bite.  I learned at their demo they are hand dipped and made from scratch..no store bought stuff here. The cakes are made from scratch as well.  Oh and they had some novelty ones on display ..cake pops inspired by Hello Kitty!!! They were super cute!! (they are special order only so call to inquire)\n \nLocation is in the shopping center by Barley Casino.  I came here after I had my plate lunch at Ross J's...The area looks real lonely right now, but come March the Galaxy Theater is moving in there! \n\nThe shop itself is pretty nice size, bright and airy feel.  Looks like they have an area set up to have parties.  Their signs and light fixtures are all their handiwork. It's  just so cute with charming touches of a sweet shop.  There are also gift boxes for your treats, aprons, cupcake gift items, handcrafted accessories (I got a very cute crocheted hat and scarf)  The lady who help us was friendly. I was told you can do special orders on cake pops, along with other baked goods and cakes they have displayed.  Check out their store it's all around delightful!"
1,"Jason Durant gave some incredible recommendations for the specialty rolls that really hit the spot! Good sushi, good service and great location!!!"
1,"Terrific shop!  Clean and neat as could be, friendly owner, and good prices.  All smoke shops should be this good."
0,i feel like this one is so much different from others i have been to.  i am always confused about where to find things and it is hard to maneuver around because of disorganization and the long lines that run in to the aisles.  i do not really like this location but it is convenient for when i am on my lunch break.  i just have to allow myself plenty of line to wait in line...
0,"Let me start by saying that the food is absolutely delicious and the price is great. My only issue with this location is that my orders are always wrong. My roommate and I go to this place about once or twice a week and we have yet to get our order 100% correct. We do not order anything complicated - all our food is straight from the menu as is. Sometimes, they will forget to add things such as the ranch dressing or sides of guacamole, and other times they forget parts of the orders. When I go back in, they fulfill the rest of the order with no hassle, but it's frustrating to always have to triple check the bags and then waste the time going back in to fix their mistakes. The receipts will have all parts of the order acknowledged, but the bags do not correspond. Safe to say that after yet ANOTHER incorrect order, I will be going to other locations."

0,"Hoo boy... if you're looking for the tool section Crowbar is for you.  Somewhere between a gas station and tattoo shop in a strip mall in northwest las vegas is where you'll find this magnet for fauxhawks and lower back tattoos.  I haven't been here in years and don't plan on changing that anytime soon.  Parking is not a problem, the venue is large enough and has the same selection of booze you'll find at any neighborhood bar.  However, it's the clientele that earns this place a lonely star."
1,"This was a stop during our downtown graduation bar crawl and I will definitely be back.  The place is a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but it is squished in the small downtown area. It has an outdoor patio area, and inside bar, and the lounge itself is in the shape of a long and narrow rectangle.\n\nI really like the minimalist decor and atmosphere.  During their happy hour, 4-7PM, the inside of the bar is really well lit and it's actually quite refreshing.  Happy hour consisted of 1/2 of well drinks and $1 off beers (according to our bartender although it states 1/2 of well drinks, beer, and wine everywhere online), not the best I've had but I'll take it.\n\nI must say, I was a huge fan of the music they were playing.  Their playlist certainly touched my hipster heartstrings. \n\nAlso, they have a portion of a wire fence hanging on a wall in the lounge.  This mimics the lover's bridge in Paris where you can buy/bring a lock, sign yours and your lover's name on it, lock it onto the fence, throw away the key, and forever symbolize your eternal love for one another (that is, until they cut the locks off or take down the fence).  But it was romantic nonetheless.  Two friends actually bought a lock (I don't know from where but it had to have been nearby on Fremont) and locked their love on the fence. Cute."
0,"For the price, it should have been much better.\n\nThe serice was really good.   The staff gets 5 stars.\n\nThe steak wasn't the greatest.  I mean, it wasn't too bad.But, for the price I thought it should have been better.    For a commercial thing in Vegas, I mean it's a touristy thing, let the tourists have fun, they will like it.   I live in San Francisco and have a lot of really nice steak places to go to and I've eaten at many others which have had better cuts of meat and were cooked better.\n\nWe sent one back because it was well done and we asked for a medium.  It came out right away, no waiting an hour for them to cook another, I'm sure they 'borrowed' someone elses to get ours out quickly, which is nice.  But, that wasn't cooked much less than the first one. :(\n\nThe steak was pretty tough.   The lobster tail was a little over cooked.\n\nIf you're not used to going to really nice places, (My Mom ate with us and she isn't used to going out to places like this) and she had a great time and didn't know the difference.   If you know the difference, you'll probably want to go elsewhere.\n\nWe spent in the neighborhood of $500 for 4 people.  It should have been the best quality for that price.    Now, we didn't eat the cheap stuff either.  2 of us had the surf & turf with the lobster tail.  and a couple of glasses of wine.\n\nWe skipped dessert and they brought us one small one on the house, that was nice.  Like I said, the staff was perfect from start to finish.  The quality of the meal was the only problem."
1,"I've never been disappointed with a smoothie here. I like to try a new one each time and it's always great. Great place and always busy. \n\nThey could have a little friendlier staff, but they're young so it's understandable."
0,Awful!!!! The owner kicked out my 9 year old daughter because of her service dog. When my husband tried to explan she was a certified service dog he could care less! My poor daughter left in tears. When I called to complain he just berated me over the phone as well.
0,"Never will I go back here again... I think its time store manager for a staff meeting in customer service..i have never seen a more sad crew of people in my life.. Especially the cashiers. Never do they look up and look face to face and ask have we found everything okay.i dont even think they hear my answer.. And some of them look like their uniforms need a good washing, also ever heard of an iron?. I also have never been more disgusted then hearing a cashier and bagger talk about there night out together and how drunk they got.. Keep it for the break room ladies... Maybe a field trip to Safeway is in order... Now Safeway has it together.. Yes a little more pricy but well worth the great customer service..and I have never heard a dirty story come out of the staffs mouth.. Sucks because frys is much more convenient for me.."
0,This is a good restaurant but the staff are extremely lazy and cold except for 2 ladies that work there if you plan to go there you'll be waiting for at least 10 mins before they acknowledge your there to be seated when the place is almost empty the food is burnt and over cooked  I will say they have good beans I will not go back because they have lazy cooks that cut corners and they don't seem to care plus the noise is so loud from the bar you can't even have a conversation with your friend or family
1,"Joni is awesome. I needed a quick haircut once again, and it's tough since I don't know to many people out here in Vegas to cut my hair. I've tried 3 places, and all 3 have messed my hair up. I just need a straight-forward trim and clean up. My hair is thick and rich, for some reason it gives people a hard time. Any who, I walked-in to Sola Salons, not knowing that there were several studios to choose from in which probably most of them were closed. It's just not a salon, with a receptionist in front...every stylist has there own little spot they cut out of, pretty neat. Luckily Joni had time before her next appt. so she was able to get me in. She was very nice, good person to chat with, from town so filled me in with the 411 of the surrounding area. She did a nice job, didn't butcher my hair, and price was affordable. She will be the 1st of all the stylist I've tried since moving out here from Chicago that I will go back to."
1,"Great little family owned place.  A good portion of the client\u00e8le is actually Middle Eastern, so they've got to be doing something right.  The owner, Mike, is always around and very friendly, and usually hanging out in the market part of the building.  There's a hookah bar upstairs, but having an aversion to hookah, I've never ventured in.   The market is neat to look around in and a good place to go for some excellent fresh feta cheese or lamb.\n\nOn to the food.. it is fantastic and inexpensive.  You can get a falafel sandwich and fries for under $5, but that's about the cheapest meal on the menu.  The have a lunch buffet Monday - Friday from 11-3 for $10.  It's a very small buffet and at least half of it is cold food like salads and hummus.  About 75% of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating, but I always enjoy it.\n\nAs an added bonus, the last time I was there the guy who refilled my water was wearing one of those t-shirts with kittens on it.. their faces on the front, and their butts on the back.  I don't know if he was serious or not, but it was pretty amazing."
1,"I am writing this review to say how much I appreciate this casino.  We have been staying at the JW Marriott often this last year and find the place to be a small wonderful slice of everything we are looking for in Las Vegas without the hectic pace of the larger casinos and strip.  The casino host Brenda Park is amazing for help with any thing a player might need. She has been a key reason we have come to love this place so much.  She has made each trip we have made here special.   The casino is not new  but has many newer machines and every denomination you want to play. Table dealers are friendly.   The rest of the staff is  warm and welcoming.  The players are mixed from local to traveling guests at the hotel.  Many seniors play here as Summerlin must have a large retirement community. I find that a good sign.  If the casino were not good, who better would know that then the local people? Especially older people who have been on the planet long enough to know better.haha   We live 3 hours from Las Vegas and this is one of our favorite places to play.  Enjoy!"
1,"You may ask yourself...but aren't all gas stations alike? Before visiting the Trop Stop I would have said yes! Well, kind of. Typically when I fill up, I go to Smith's...its just cheaper because I buy a lot of groceries there...however, when I am looking to get my car washed, I go to Trop Stop. They have your traditional drive through carwash, but what you don't see is that if you buy the traditional car wash (around $7) you will get a hand wash and hand dry...once you pull up to the car wash, 1-2 attendants will come out and scrub your car down really really well. After you go through the wash, they will do a very good hand dry. They will do this even if you get the cheapest wash offered. All you need to do is tip the attendants. Seriously, you can get a hand car wash for anywhere between $10-15 depending on your tip. I've not seen anything like this before. However, after I stopped by my first time (have been back a few times since) I always see Limo's there. This is where many of the limo's in town get their wash, I can imagine its because of the price and quality. Additionally, you can get a hand wash pretty much anytime of the day. I've gotten one as late as 11pm (after parking under a tree all day). This is definitely a gem in the town full of car wash joints...."
1,"This is my second trip to Brooklyn Bowl since it opened. First time I saw Cake and the venue size versus crowd was completely excellent. \n\nThis time I went for food and I have to give huge props to the host staff. I called a reservation, but wasn't going to make it because some ridiculous concert was going on in the free outdoor lot for the Linq. After being turned away from no less than four lots (seriously security/traffic control WTF it's pretty anti-business), ended up parking at Caesars. Gillian saved my table! And was extremely courteous to my party. Gillian made our night! \n\nFood was alright-- decent prices for downtown. Fried chicken was excellent, must have been a good night."
0,"I often use extremes in my reviews....\""best service\"" or \""worst logo\""...you get the idea. Unfortunately, I'm not concerned about overusing superlatives in this review. Instead, eating at Euro Cafe turned out to just be weird. Like seriously weird.\n\nWe walked into the cutesy gift shop/waiting area (think LGO for old ladies) and we were greeted by a very chipper young teenage hostess with whom we had some fun, pleasant banter. I was thinking....hmm, this place should be cool. Before we sat down, I glanced over to the large dessert case, which--from my friend's recommendations--was likely to be the highlight of the visit, and I was a bit surprised to see that it was half-empty. And this was at 7pm on a Saturday night.\n\nI wasn't too worried, though. Our server seemed great at first. She actually just sat down at our table and talked all about the menu with us....she was very helpful and made a couple of recommendations. She proceeded to take our drink orders, for me a glass of the Malbec and, for my dining companion, a vanilla latte. We had to re-try on the wine because they were out of the Malbec, but no big deal, right? Our drinks arrived, and she asked us if we had decided on our entrees.This was when her attitude got a bit weird and pushy. We told her what entrees we wanted, but before we could even tell her that we also wanted to try an appetizer, she jetted away from the table. If I may add, she left the table grabbing my companion's latte without asking if she was finished (she still had about 10% of the drink she wanted to enjoy).\n\nThe server then brought our salads. Their salad is a nice, standard mixed greens and I ordered the yogurt dressing which was quite nice. We finished our salads, and being the good former server I am, I placed our plates--along with my fork--in a small pre-bussed stack on the side of our table. My friend asked me if I thought they would want me to re-use my fork, and I replied \""I'm not planning on eating a $20 entree with a re-used fork\"". Note: I'm aware that $20 isn't like haute cuisine pricing, but I mean I just don't think you should have to lick the dressing off of  a salad fork to eat your entree at that price point. What happened next was very weird. The waitress stopped by, saw my dirty fork on top of my pre-bussing pile, then proceeded to--while I sat there perfectly still and silent--take my dirty fork off of my salad plate and move it over to my place setting next to my clean knife. Weird.\n\nThen our entrees came. Well, they were really tossed at us more than anything. She dropped the pork tenderloin in front of me and the almond tortellini in front of my friend, which is especially odd since the server had made such a big deal about me being a vegetarian. I'm not surprised, though. I had--just five minutes earlier--seen a full-on food auction at the table next to us because the server had no idea who ordered what. Anyway, back to our food. Our server just dropped the food and walked away before we could say anything....not asking \""does everything look ok\"" or \""is there anything else I can get for you\"". Of course, it wasn't the end of the world for us to have to switch our plates, it was just really weird.\n\nThe good news is that my Almond Tortellini was amazing. It was full of fun surprises like sunflower seeds and pine nuts, and the sauce was heavenly. The tortellini were the perfect texture and consistency. My dining companion ordered the tenderloin, and although I couldn't try any of it, I couldn't help but notice that the amount of sawing it required to cut off a bite was more reminiscent of a pork chop than a tenderloin. In spite of the dryness of the meat,  it looked to be a nice balance of flavors, with a cherry sauce, grilled onions, and horseradishy mashed potatoes. The odd service continued, though. No one ever checked back to ask about the food, and when my friend's water went empty it was a full 8 1/2 minutes for the hostess to finally come by and refill it. Even more odd was that once we had clearly finished our entrees, it was a long time before anyone came by to take away our plates. It was 18 minutes between our last bite and when our server came back (yes, I was keeping track by now, because the whole thing was just so odd). She offered dessert, but by this time, we both just wanted to leave, so we asked for the check.\n\nWhen she brought back the check and my card, she suddenly was miss personality, telling us how glad she was that we came and how much she looks forward to seeing us again. Honestly, I wish she had been so helpful when we were actually still having our meal.\n\nOverall, the environment at this restaurant is just plain weird and uncomfortable. I would love to eat the Tortellini again, but if the price for enjoying that great dish is sitting through another hour of awkwardness in this restaurant, I'll just have to go without"
1,"So, there is a Yogurtland in Las Vegas, thank goodness! Love this place! It's self-serve, like a lot of other yogurt places, and there are a lot of flavors to choose from. But, the difference is the frozen yogurt tastes better than any other yogurt place I've been to, in my opinion; and the price is better too! Definitely recommend trying this place."
1,Had a great night at the patio bar. The bartender was very pleasant and knowledgeable about gluten allergies which made my wife very happy. \nThe layout is great and the food was ben better. Very interesting space with a very clean and open kitchen. \nI highly recommend it for a casual night out.
0,"Music terrible food way over priced 39 dollar rib eye should not be paper thin , the venue was off the hook should have been a great experience but you can't judge a book by it cover!"
0,"First, I will say that some of the food here is very good.\n\nHowever, when I ate here on a Saturday night with 3 companions, it was pretty disappointing. First, they were out of lasagna. This is an Italian restaurant at 6:45 on a Saturday night. So I ordered a pasta and seafood dish another diner was enjoying and it was excellent-- lots of mussels, clams, and shrimp in a marinara sauce tossed with pasta.\n\nTwo of my friends ordered one of the many pizza combinations but were served the quatro fromaggio instead, not what they ordered. It was pretty salty, too. There was no apology, just a lecture by the chef to the undertrained teenage waiter.\n\nI think that Saturday night should have an experienced server. Just my thought, as one who has waited tables in the past.\n\nThe grilled chicken salad was very good. The calamari appetizer was OK. The sauce tasted like it was from a can. My preteen liked the chicken sub and fries.\n\nMainly, it was the very poorly-trained service that was the problem. There should have been an apology for serving the wrong pizza.. That would have gone a long way."
0,"Eek!  Says it perfectly.  Maybe it's because I am a white girl with blonde hair, blue eyes, and was raised in the suburbs, but this mall terrifies me.  The husband got a baseball hat for Christmas and we had to return it here of all places.  As soon as we walked in, I instinctively clutched all of my valuables to my chest and grabbed the husband's hand.  I didn't release that position until we were safely back on the road.  I know this mall is ghetto because it is in the ghetto.  That makes sense.  You cater to your audience, not to people who live miles and miles away.  Needless to say, I don't belong here and they don't have anything to offer here that would make me think otherwise.  I won't be back unless I am forcibly dragged."
1,"Nice to find a good crepe's restaurant in my new 'hood ;) \n\nAfter a couple hours of hiking the trails at South Mountain, we were kinda famished (& thirsty). Yelp'ed a few options and decided on this one- crepe's sounded yummy.\n\nIt was busy on a mid-Sunday morning, yet just two parties ahead of us waiting for tables. It was hot outside (PHOENIX ;p, its a given) but definitely \""cooler\"" than the past few days. Hungry = getting cold drinks and deciding to sit outside. \n\nIt actually was comfortable, and we were able to order & get our food quickly. Simple menu, great options. My friend went wit the featured special, I built my own savory crepe. Devoured. We both got nutella crepes for \""dessert\""....not as good as my spot I found in San Diego, though good nonetheless. It was starting to really heat up so the whipped creme melted literally as soon as they were brought to us. Okay with me, since I wasn't gonna eat it anyway but it was funny. Waitress brought us extra glasses of water- she knew we were in the \""warm\"" area- great service.\n\nGreatly priced, fast and pleasant service, great size portions. This may be a tradition in the making. ;p"
1,"Look, we all know Cox sucks. In fact they are a terrible business and their practices are laughable. However they are a necessary evil if you want Internet that isn't garbage that can handle streaming/gaming. The way they handle issues over the phone is worse than Comcast, and for all my east coast brothers/sisters you know what a serious accusation that is. It all started with shitty TV Service. My household went through 4 dvr boxes. 4. That all broke. All of them. 100's of hours of TV. Lost. Every. Single. Time. Their solution? Downgrade from contour. That's their genius solution. So my solution? Upgrade to Dish for TV. PROBLEM SOLVED. However they charged us $200 to disconnect claiming we were on a contract. Nope, disputed that. However to dispute it you have to literally mail a letter to corporate. In the mean time, they cut off my Internet service for pay bills AND THEN DOUBLE CHARGED ME FOR THE INTERNET. WHAT? EXCUSE ME? How does that even make sense? So, an angry phone call and 2 hours on hold, I get the Internet back on because I work from home and to refund the double charged service they have to send a check, via the mail, to a local store. Okay, cool. A week later, let's drive from San tan valley to Gilbert. Once we arrive , turns out the check wasn't mailed. In fact the person helping us via the phone wrote that checks can't be sent to the store, and put a future apology in the notes to us. Thanks Cox cock. So, if you made it this far, why do I give this store 5 stars? The Manager, Mario. That's why. The savior of my people. Stepped in. Saw the crap we went through and listened to my tale. With about 5 minutes of effort , he credited our account for $300. $200 for the bs fee , $50 for the double charge and another $50 just because he was sorry. That's customer service. That's being a great human. He's the man, and my opinion of Cox has changed. ALWAYS GO TO A COX STORE. ALWAYS! They know their stuff and actually care. They are not the call center idiots. They are true experts and will always get the job done. Thank you Mario at the Gilbert Cox Store. Thank you so much"
1,"Wonderful Thai food - best I've had in Pittsburgh!  Watch out the food is HOT and the portions are big.\n\nSome friends ordered two fried apps - the calamari and the wonton.  They were OK, I don't like fried food though, so you should probably take that with a grain of salt.\n\nMy entree, the Panang curry, tasted wonderful, but was too hot for me (it was set at a 3, don't let that deter you though my taste buds are weak!) so they replaced it with the Massan curry, which was also awesome.\n\nI also tried a little Pad Thai and then a meat and vegetable dish that I can't remember the name of - both were great! \n\nThe only downside was the lack of ambiance, but if you get a table up the stairs in the back of the restaurant it's OK.\n\nI'll be going back!"
1,"This place is the best. They carry all the dog food brands that I would deem as much healthier (and more costly) but here they have the cheapest price I have found in town by far and even online! Super friendly and helpful staff, tons of toys/treats and other dog supplies. Must faster too than waiting for that online order to ship out to you."
1,"I feel compelled to say that I agree with Vinh about Mindy W. There are too many people who write these food reviews trying to sound like they're a foodie, or at least knowledgeable about food, and then it turns out they only go out like four times a year!\n\nI like Capital Grille. I like it as much as Morton's. I like both better than Smith and Wollensky, Butcher and Singer, Ruth's Chris, Sullivan's, and The Palm. I get my steaks medium rare. On rare occasion, such as when I order prime rib at S&W, I get it rare. This is the ONLY way to eat quality meat. USDA Prime meat (and Choice) is not going to kill you like the crap you get in supermarkets. Supermarket meat needs to be cooked well done because the supermarket butcher probably rarely washes his hands.\n\nI've tried the sliced filet mignon, the filet \""cooked to order\"", the lobster bisque, and the crab cocktail at Capital. The lobster bisque needed more lobster, but the bisque was quite good and not too strong. My filet entrees were awesome. It's amazing that they can make Choice cuts taste like Prime."

1,"This was a decent comedy show. The jokes weren't forced like that terrible Defending the Caveman show and the comics definitely knew how to get the crowd going!\n\nIt also included a free drink which was a plus. \n\nThe only thing I'd gripe about was the hot and slutty girl that periodically turned the show from comedy to strip club. Not that I mind a hot girl stripping on stage, but the guy controlling the lights was messing with us by turning them off at the most critical moment of her performance! \nThat was very disappointing...\n\nAside from that, great show!"
1,"first time there tonight,being from new york i know great italian food,i had the chicken parm with pene & soup. the owners & the people that work there are very nice.will definitely be back real soon for another great meal."
1,"Wanted to try this resto for a while. Saw it on the event \""Montreal a table\"" so called to make a reservation. The food was not bad. I saw the less good reviews and couldn't really understand why. Maybe I am just lucky. This is the part about restaurant that is difficult to rate, the food quality that are not consistent. Service was so so, little slow at filling our glass of water. The place have very nice decor. Overall I like the experience. Hope it could keep up the good work not just for \""Montreal a table\"""
0,"Unfortunately my husband and I never even got the chance to eat here. We called about 5 days ahead to make a reservation for Saturday and were told the restaurant was booked. That was understandable; we waited a little too late to call as it was a last minute trip to The Strip. When we got to the Paris hotel, we decided to walk past the restaurant to check it out. My husband is in culinary school and is impressed with Gordon Ramsey's high standards of service. The line for us happened when we were outside the restaurant looking in. A couple walked past and the hostess at the stand outside asked them if they'd like reservations to eat there that night, on Saturday, when this couple didn't even approach the stand. With such high standards, we did not expect to be denied a reservation when they obviously had space available, as evidenced by the hostess asking passers by to eat there! Left us with a bad taste in our mouths; my husband was very disappointed. Won't be going to a Ramsey establishment any time soon. Ate at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar instead."
0,"Just came back from that festival. I don t want to be bad. We are from Europe. This is a real joke. Between charlemagne ( 8th century), the elephants, and the renaissance it is almost 600 years between!  You pay 20 dollars for what! Park your car maybe in rocks!.you must pay everything inside. 1 dol to 6 dol at least. Just for rides. Family of 6. It hurts!. + food(awfull) drinks( I am not sure they put any alcohol in the cocktails($6 each). Go once and never go back. Good luck!"
1,"We went in around noon. But they let us to order breakfast because we told them we were craving breakfast. My mom and I ordered Tableau Breakfast. It came with a basket of pastry which tasted like just coming out of oven. I chose sausages with my eggs. The sausages were really tasted. Best sausages I ever had in U.S. The scamble eggs were just normal but the portion was huge. I didn't finish my eggs. The hash brown was not your normal hash brown....but in a good way.....it shaped like small cakes and the texture of them were really special and very delicated. i think it's not easy to make a plain old hash brown taste delicated. But the best part came after I asked for Ketchup for my hash brown. I was expecting a bottle of Hein's ketchup....but no....they gave me a cup of fresh-made ketchup....that kinda blew me away......well... .at that point....I finially realized what is fine dining for breakfast....\nThe fresh-made ketchu tasted so good and so fresh....I finished my hash brown cakes just because I wanted to have the ketchup.  anyway.....the taste and quality of the food totally worth the price. In my opinion, the breakfast we could order to our room can't compare with breakfast I had in Tableau, althought they price about the same. \n\nBesides, at Tableau, I can enjoy the good view, excellent serivce, silver tableware, and fresh-made ketchup... :P"
0,"ZERO STARS!! Don't use them!!!' I reserved a 4am pickup to airport. Driver showed up at my house a week early. I called to confirm that they had date and time correct. At 4am this morning, driver didn't show. I called dispatch and all they could tell me is that there is no driver available. They are unorganized and undependable!"
0,"I love a good steak and have no problem paying for one, but Prime's is not worth the price. We had two different cuts, the porterhouse and the dry-aged bone-in ribeye. The quality of the steak might have been there, but the preparation of it threw the whole thing off. However, I did really like the sauce that accompanied the steaks, so much so that we requested some in leftover box. We had truffle mashed potatoes that were divine (but honestly, it's truffle so how bad could it be?) but the glazed carrots were tangy, which I did not like at all. As for the appetizers, we shared the Caesar salad which was fabulous. The presentation was unique in that it was a whole head of romaine lettuce (I'll post a picture).\n\nService was confusing to say the least. Our server was very nice and friendly, but very condescending. Maybe it was because we look young, but when we asked a question about the mushrooms he became very patronizing towards us. The same when we wanted coffee. It was very odd. We also waited a long time for little things like the coffee, bread, butter, etc. They didn't even bring bread until we asked for it.\n\nI much prefer returning to Craftsteak on the Strip."
0,"My kids and I went here to grab some take out just a couple days ago.\nThe pro's-\nThe Italian fries were tasty. Parmigian with garlic and a bit of oil.\nThe chili cheeseburger was good....but here's the thing.\nThe con's- shortly after we arrived there and placed our order, the manager and or owner was well within earshot, telling....yelling at one of his (former?) employees that he was \""f'ing fired!\"". Extremely loud. The other employees seemed a bit shaken up, so maybe that explains the quality of our food.\nThe chili cheese dog was ok. It seemed under cooked. Again, maybe  it was the situation. \nDefinitely willing to give this place another chance, seeing how favorably this place is reviewed...."
1,Out-of-towners need to put Fogo de Ch\u00e3o Brazilian Steakhouse on their bucket list of steakhouses to eat at in Scottsdale. I had the New York Sirloin with the pepper crust and it was delicious. Just the right spice to complement the Markham cabernet we selected. My wife had the Halibut and it too was outstanding. Our servers were attentive and very helpful. We had a wonderful evening.
1,"What a surprise hit! We had attempted on previous visits to make it through Trop's Mob Experience and each time something wasn't working. Finally, after they revamped and refreshed, we visited today and were surprised from beginning to end. Highly interactive, lots of reality mixed with legend and an overall a fun time. Highly recommend."
1,"OMG!!!! House special: Ice milk, with boba, grass jelly and pudding! Where have you been all my life?! I just can't get over it. The boba, jelly & pudding complements the taste of the milk or vice versa. I love boba drinks! This place is the BEST-test that i've tried so far. The owner was really nice, sweet and was nice to talked to. A warm welcome, approachable & really good customer service. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and there it is, my boba waiting on my table. I wanna go back now!!"
0,"This review is for customer service only.  I have not tried any pastries, but I didn't want to after our experience.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I frequent the Tea Station (on the floor below Crown Bakery), but we wanted to try something a little different.  We walked into the Crown Bakery to see what they offer, and after reading lots of Yelp reviews, I was super excited.  I will say, the place is super cute and cozy (hence two stars instead of one).  I immediately noticed that they also serve boba drinks - the sign on the wall gave a list of their offerings.  I love boba, and I love to try boba all over the city.  Curious, I asked the lady behind the counter if that was a complete list of what they make.\n\nWell.  I guess I'm a moron, because she said, \""WHAAAAT??!?  WE DON'T SERVE BOOOOBBBAAAA HERE!\""  with her eyebrows waggling.  She told us to go down to Tea Station if we wanted boba... she was so rude about it, like I was a total idiot for asking.  Then she proceeded to cackle like a damn witch.  I said, \""but, but, but... they are listed on the menu...,\"" stumbling all over myself because her behavior just wasn't appropriate for the situation.  It reminded me of Saturday Night Live.  It would make a good segment... she could be a good regular character!  They could call her Inappropriate Reaction Sally.  It was such a bizarre exchange of words that I started laughing.  She was laughing at me, and I was laughing at her.  Dueling cackles.  Cue banjos.\n\nNope, I won't be ordering pastries anytime soon.  In fact, I took her advice and headed on down to Tea Station, my regular hangout.  Good advice, Inappropriate Reaction Sally.  That might have been the most intelligent (and appropriate) thing you said all day."
1,Excellent service. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. They worked had to make us feel relaxed. My husband enjoyed our massage so much we came back the next day for another 90 min... he's spoiled.
0,"This is the worst location in Vegas. They always screw up my order, the staff is rude, and the owner actually TRIES to get in arguments with you about his Multi-level marketing business. The owner is a douche and his staff is just as bad."
1,"I love the food at Paradise Bakery.  It's fresh, and pretty consistant.  I like the choices they have for kids' meals, and the fact that they come with a yogurt.  The customer service at this location could use a little help.  I have had employees be smart/short/rude with me on most occasions.  Why do I put up with it?  The food is so good!  The salads are amazing, and they're huge.  If my family is really tired,and doesn't want to cook dinner but doesn't want \""fast\"" food, this is our go to.  If you go in towards the end of their dinner rush, they are normally out of things.  One or two ingredients for your salad, or to-go containers.  Something.  As previous reviewers have mentioned, the ordering system is a little frustrating.  It's easier to navigate when it's not lunch hour.  This location is bananas from 11am-1pm.  I won't even go at that time anymore."
1,I am from New York.  Born on the upper east side of manhattan to some yuppie parents and raised on the Gold Coast of Long Island.  I am a snob by nature.  To make matters worse when I was about 19 I decided I was brave enough to try my hand at cooking professionally.  Anywho fast forward about a decade I dropped cooking like a bad habit we don't need to get into what I actually do now. I'm more retired then anything.  Ok getting to the point.  When ever I decide to take a mental health day during the week or when I'm feeling frisky early on a Saturday this is my go to spot.  BEST BAGELS IN PHX.  #fact.  Two fried eggs bacon and cheese on a toasted everything bagel. Don't get fancy at this place stick to the basics and thank me later!
0,Was really looking forward to this since I love sandwiches and Tom C.  But man I was really disappointed.  Maybe it's cuz I've had some really really stellar sandwiches but these just felt like there was no love put into them.  I got one of the pork one and it was dry and thin.  Really a shame.
1,I've been here three times so far and I keep coming back. They have a very nice lounge area that is chilled and laid back. The food is great and they have tons of hookah flavors to pick from.
1,"I had the beginning stages of my bi-annual physical this morning...after the good doctor (and he is a good doctor...some of the best doctor jokes I've ever heard:) was finished prodding, poking and invasively examining me, I set my Yelp for 'droid on \""healthy eating\""...the app thought I said \""hot doggies\"" and took me to Famous Uncle Al's (hey, when a computer (no matter how small that computer is) tells you do something, you had better do it:)\n\nI am trying now to figure how to rate it...3 Stars?...4 Stars?...Pi Stars?

0,"In Atlantic City this would be a solid 4 stars, believe it or not. However, compared to what's happening south of the Riviera on The Strip right now, meh.\n\nThere are a couple of things to note on the good side- \nthe slots are never crowded and neither are the table games\nthe crowd here is as unpretentious as you can get \nthe history of the resort is hard to match- Dino used to be a part owner and Liberace was the headliner here shortly after the doors opened for the first time. Frank Sinatra had one of the rooms in the Monte Carlo Tower remodeled to meet his tastes during one of his runs. There are a few exhibits of the heyday of the Riviera near the Monaco Tower including a great photo of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis onstage together.\nrooms are cheap\nPeppermill is right next door\n\nOn the bad side-\nit's dated inside...from the way it's decorated to the way it's operated\nunless you can appreciate \""Old Vegas\"" you won't think you are getting the Vegas experience here\n\nSome new developments are underway nearby which may force the Riv to update and upgrade in order to stay relevant. For now, they are firmly in the 70s & 80s in terms of style and it's not even good enough for hipster irony right now."
1,Awesome place. Except the ID guy needs to learns manners and/or customer service skills.
1,"Simply put, if you like chicken fried steak and you haven't been here you don't really like chicken fried steak.  I've eaten chicken fried steak pretty much everywhere in the world that its available and it just doesn't get much better than this.  Go with the fried potatoes instead of the mashed.  Not that the mashed are bad, just that the fried potatoes are so GOOD.  For those that are less enthusiastic about chicken fried steak, the fried chicken breast is also great as are the steaks and burgers.  Love the house salad with light oil dressing and diced olives on top.  Oh, and the biscuits, top notch, TOP NOTCH.  Don't let them get away with bringing you a bread basket that's half filled with biscuits and half filled with some wheat roll disaster, ask for all biscuits.  You're welcome."
0,"HORRIBLE!! HORRIBLE!! HORRIBLE!! Run away as fast as you can. If you can get your money back/refund from living social, do so right now. Robyn, the office manager is a terrible person. Was not honest at all and kept feeding us lies. Move was to be due at noon and they did not come until 7pm. We ended up not using them. Found out from one of the movers that the truck that was supposed to for us got sent for another job. No customer service at all. Tried to add extra surcharges. I agree with the other reviews, doesn't even deserve one star."
0,"I work down in Chandler near Hong Kong gourmet boofay. I can go in there for lunch and for about the same price as I paid as GG I can get Mongolian stir fry, sushi and Chinese buffet...and honestly, the Mongolian stir fry at HKG would kick GG's ass all over the place. \n\nI had some pork, some beef, some veggies and some different sauces with fried rice. The pork was tough, crappy cuts full of grissle (sp?). The beef was just ok...still tough however. All in all, it just wasn't that great...I did not enjoy my bowl. My daughter and son both enjoyed thiers but it just wasn't happening for me. Pricing aside, the Mongolian stir fry at other places has been much better.\n\nNow add in no drink refills and indifferent service and 2 stars is just about right. I don't see myself returning to GG."
1,"Came in today to sign up for a membership.  Didn't even know this place existed, but a friend made sure I signed up.\n\nI haven't had the chance to try any of the machines.  Overall, the place looks clean and not busy.  I came today to try the Zumba class with Barb.  It wasn't crowded which was good.  \n\nThe staff was super friends.  Jules (Julliet) was the one that signed me up.  She was super friendly and sweet.  \n\nI like the fact that this place is close to where I live.  The classes overall, will be the reason why I go in.  It'll be my only motivation. Nice way to enjoy your weekend :)"
1,"My favorite local restaurant, however I don't get here often enough.  Waitstaff is great, and decor is lovely, especially outdoors during the summer months, twice the hostess was a little snooty however food, decor and service outweigh her attitude. \n\nMy favorite dish is the scallops, and the butter lettuce with brie salad, simply delightful and or course their pretzel bread is to die for.  In fact their simple butter presentation with olive oil is also so good.\n\nTheir wine offerings are great and cocktails are creative and yummy. I would recommend for date or girls night out."
0,"The ambience was very nice with a pretty cool band was playing, the salmon panini we was pretty good but why it only received two stars?\n\nWe ordered which perhaps is the worst pizza I've ever had! I'm not a picky eater by any means but they should seriously take it off the menu, I've had better frozen pizzas!"
1,Just opening the door and smelling that baked goodness immediately puts you in a good mood.  I think this is what heaven smells like. My favorite donut from when I was a little girl back in IL where there were lots of real bakeries was a sugar cinnamon twist.  They make it just how I remember!  The donuts are good sized and very well priced. It won't disappoint!
1,"What a neat little place! Imagine a deli style wine bar that does pretty much everything right. As I understand, this is a family affair an it shows. Everything is done with care an attention to detail. The wine selection is nice, reasonably priced and even a little adventurous. Every bit of nosh I have had here has been well prepared and tasty. The only complaint I have is the lighting. Not much ambiance when the place super duper bright at 9pm. Having said this, I'm told they are expanding into the vacant space next door and that it will carry a more traditional ambient wine/dining experience. Has anyone got a Candle? I CANT WAIT!"
0,"One of those restaurants where you go in, and go \""huh, why is it sooo empty\"".  Albeit it's a Wed nght, but it's also Restaurant Week... I even felt like we owned the entry area of the Theodore.. never saw a soul except a desk guy hidden in an alcove.  Park in the adjacent Buckboard lot, as there was a sign stating Guest Parking $10 though I didn't see an attendant who could collect.\n\n4 people, all a variety of dishes from the very promising sounding menu so we definitely had the works.  It just did not wow.  I appreciated the papardelle pasta was freshly made (but kept tossing overboard to my bf the mushy bland short rib meat... mid week leftovers?) and the meyer lemon tart.  General repeated comment re: our mains... salty.\n\nNow I can see this being a place for lounging and drinks, especially if they were to draw those curtains down around you to cozy up your table.  But I want to like the food too."
1,"We were staying at a local hotel and used online ordering to feed our crew.  The ordering went smoothly and the pleasant surprise was the food arrived early and warm.  We ordered two of their usual pizzas and one of our custom orders.  Could have had a few more toppings on one of them, but overall nice value and timely service with warm food.  We looked for the specials on-line and save a few dollars.  Worth the time to do so.  Would order again."
0,"Fees! Fees! Fees! Don't sign up for this card. They will charge you a fee for opening the card. They will charge you a fee for authorized user. They will charge you a fee for the \""premium design\"" of the card itself. And, they will charge you a fee to pay the fees online! I would give them zero stars if I could!"
0,"What a let down! Pizza was 15min late from the 40-45m pickup wait, staff was blah, and when I got home to try the pizza... Totally let down... And ps - the angry crayon written signs all over the place are soooo tacky."
1,"I couldn't agree more about wanting to give this place more stars! \n\nMy husband and I (just recently vegetarians) met a good friend (a life-time vegetarian) at Green for dinner last night, and WOW were we impressed!\n\nThere was a constant flow of customers in and out in the 2 hours were sat, ate and talked. You order at the counter and your food is brought to you; the line moved fast and the food was fast to come out of the kitchen piping hot\n\nWe started with the \""buffalo\"" wings - the sauce was super flavorful and the dipping sauce was sooo good we ordered more to go with our meals\n\nI had the \""Wendy Pickle\"" - closest vegetarian Chik-Fil-A sandwich ever! It was so flavorful and the fries that came with it were great!\n\nMy husband had the \""Big Wac\"" - vegetarian version of the Big Mac - he said it was amazing!\n\nTo finish it off we had the Dough Boy for dessert - YUM YUM YUM!!!\n\nWe cannot wait to go back :)"
0,"If I could give this company 0 stars I would.  This is the WORST company I have ever booked with.  I was \""notified\"" that our flight was cancelled via email and was directed to contact them via phone to book a new flight.  I have called this company multiple times to get this straightened out.  YOU CANNOT REACH A HUMAN BEING!  I REPEAT HUMANS ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO TALK TO. I now am supposed to be leaving for my trip in 1 week and have no return flight.  This company is a total sham, they will take your money and leave you in the dust.  Oh one correction, when I got sick of waiting on hold after 2 HOURS, I called back and pretended i was going to book new travel, surprise surprise, my call was answered in 1.5 minutes.  When I explained what I was calling for I was instantly transferred back to the the black hole that is their customer service.  F__ U_  ONETRAVEL!!! aka Wk Travel #frauds #terriblecompany"
1,"Wow, this place was packed at noon! There was a line almost out the door when I entered. I browsed through the menu while I waited. Having eaten at a Kneader's Bakery when I visited the SLC area, I was interested in trying out the sandwiches and baked goods here to see if the AZ location was as good as my previous experience.\n\nI decided on the turkey half sandwich ($4.39) on hazelnut 12 grain, a mint chocolate chip brownie, and a soda. The half sandwich was very filling, with nicely seasoned roast turkey, fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion, with mayo. The bread was soft, with large crunchy pieces of hazelnut in it.\n\nThe mint chocolate brownie was delicious. It was thick, fudgey, with a light whipped-cream mint frosting. \n\nSodas are Coke-based, and there is a self serve fountain.\n\nDefinitely a tasty place for a sandwich or baked sweet!"
0,"I've eaten at Jersey Mikes Subs a few times... usually this location and I always find the subs lacking flavor. On top of that the prices are more expensive than Jimmy Johns, and I think JJs has better subs all around."
1,"yummy gelato! so many many many flavors to choose from, and they rotate them once in awhile. Also have yummy fresh crepe. Everything is good, a bit on the pricier side, but totally worth it"
0,"As is the theme with all the reviews I've read, the customer service is pretty bad and they force feed the insurance down your throat. I spoke with my State Farm agent prior to making a reservation and he made it crystal clear that since I have full coverage, I am covered when renting a car. When I mentioned this to the agent, she gave me some attitude and stated \""Sir, I would like to inform  you that you are in Nevada, an at fault state and your insurance does not cover you in the event of an accident.\"" \n\nThe line was about an hour deep and it was a bit disconcerting to go through that after waiting an hour. The reservation I made through carentals.com is simply an estimate, according to senorita Payless. So, instead of paying $8/day with minimum taxes, as stated in the agreement, we paid 3 times that amount and that's after declining insurance a dozen different ways. \n\nIdk if it's Payless or the industry, but someone needs to step up in Washington (once they get their shit in order) and figure out how to protect consumers from this insanity and price gouging."
1,"Second time here and I'm still not disappointed. Had the Ronin Burger. I must say it's a tasty burger, but I liked the Miyagi-san's grass Fed Wagyu burger better. I won't stop here, I'll try something different next time. Maybe there's a hidden treasure for me or maybe the Miyagi-San's burger is the burger for me. Also tried the Pork Belly steamed buns. I'm not big on pork, but what the neck, I'm in Las Vegas, I have to try something out of my comfort zone. They were good! Good to poach outside sometimes."
1,"I do keep coming back here...can't call it 5 stars but it's definitely a good place.  Rolls are a (very) healthy size...sometimes a bit too big but hey I'm not complaining.\nI'd say I'm a big fan of the spicy tuna roll here (with the shrimp tempura too).  They have a lot of fun choices on their menu so that's definitely a plus.  If only they lowered their prices on the tepanyaki, i'd consider going for that.  Nonetheless, great happy hour that they've got, especially with that spicy tuna roll. Oh, and the guy who makes the sushi is awesome.  He actually listened to me when i said \""A LOT of extra ginger\"" and brought me an entire plate...let's just say I was a happy camper because just about all the other sushi restaurants keep bringing puny little portions and charging extra....so definitely extra bonus points to that guy!"
1,"Yaay someone who knows how to make an eggplant sub! Thank you!\n Friendly service, we were late for the lunch special but the guy gave us the deal anyway, which we appreciated.\n The pizza looked amazing but we were full. So I'll have to do an update when we get the chance to check that out.\n Very affordable yummy food. No complaints here. :)"
0,"The burgers are good but not worth the price. Buns are delicious. Meat isn't season well so the flavor mostly comes from the toppings. The farmhouse burger was okay, but I prefer real bacon :) the euro burger was really tasty, but again because of the goat cheese and aioli, it was tasty.\n\nShake #5 was good. Summary: not worth wait or price. \n\nNotes:\nLine is long. That's okay, it's on the strip and it's Gordon Ramsay. But. We got seated and then waited about 30 minutes. No food. And they have at least 15 burgers sitting under the heat lamp. The burgers obviously don't take long to cook. It's the service that takes long. We saw a hot dog sit under a heat lamp for 30 minutes before going out. If this was one of his shows, the person in charge of running the food would have gotten the boot."
1,My husband and I just moved back to Ahwatukee and tried ALL the frozen yogurt places in the area!  Yoasis is by far and away the BEST and Cleanest location!  There are a TON of toppings there and the staff is great!
1,"This place was definitely cool. The view was incredible. Drinks are expensive, but I don't do much clubbing in Vegas, so they might not be expensive relative to the rest of the clubs.\n\nAlso, I got in VIP (you know how I do) so I'm not sure what cover is. The bar was nicely decorating and had some very cool lighting going on. I was a little disappointed in the crowd, I figured the girls and guys would be much hotter. It was a good looking crowd but not what I expected. It wasn't very crowded at all for a Friday night at midnight, but there was a decent line my buddy and I blew right past.\n\nI'd go back for the view alone."
1,"Most large cities have their unique cuisine:\nGo to New York - get the pizza or a Coney Island Dog.\nGo to Chicago - get the deep dish pizza.\nGo to New Orleans - get the jambalaya and the gumbo.\nGo to Boston - get the lobster.\nGo to Philadelphia - get a cheese steak sandwich.\nCome to Phoenix - get Indian Fry Bread.\n\nMaybe you've seen fry bread at a carnival served with powdered sugar, cinnamon, and honey. That's a good dish but there's so much more to this Navajo specialty. I like it served as a beef taco but there are a number of variations with and without meat.\n\nUnfortunately I don't get here as often as I'd like but when I do come I'm never disappointed (OK, the service can be a bit sketchy)."
0,"As a big fan of Mr. Ramsay I have rather high expectations which honestly I learned from him.\n\nMy wife and I ordered Sheppard's pie, the mixed skillet with two beers and two cocktails coming to $150 including the tip.\n\nSheppard's pie:  You had to do some deep core mining to get past the\n                           mashed potatoes and get to the goodies.\n\nShrimp Cocktail:  The shrimp were really high quality but the were put\n                            into some sort of bland white sauce which reminded \n                            me of mayonnaise.\n\nMixed Skillet:       The beef had a real good flavor, the pork was a bland\n                            piece of meat occupying valuable space on the plate, \n                            the prawns were good.\n\nService:               Ordinary.\n\nThe experience overall was lackluster so on the following night we \nreturned to \""Steak\"" for our third time and had Mr. Ramsay's five course\nsignature dinner which was expensive but the food was amazing along\nwith the service.\n\nI am sure Mr. Ramsay will have the short comings at the Pub and Grill\nsorted out in short order."
1,"The original place in the Strip District is the best by far. Capicola & Cheese is my fav and though I'm not a fan of cole slaw, the fact that it's a dry slaw does it for me.  Bring your appetite and leave your attitude at the door."
0,"First and foremost I would like to say that the pretzel fondue is amazing...although it is something familiar that I have tasted before so I wouldnt go out of your way to go here. Their drink combinations are pretty good. Their food is small portions for the price! Atmosphere is unique and almost every table has a different set of chairs and style which is different. \n\nThe reason I am giving Culinary a terrible review in stars is because my poor boyfriend got food poisoning from the Beef Stroganoff! We came into AZ to re visit my college town and friends and he was out all day saturday, most of sunday, and still not up to par on Monday! I realize this was not their fault that their food was possibly contaminated, however, it was the aftermath that I was unhappy with...\n\nI called the restaurant to talk to the manager....he didnt seem to sympathetic with saying things like \""did he go to the hospital?\"" or \""I served 27 of that dish Saturday Night and I have not had one complaint yet.\"".....definitely not looking for any type of discount but with working in customer service for 10 years that is NOT the way to handle things. He was proceeding to tell me the length of time it can take and how it could have been from something earlier that day or the night before...really?! Needless to say even though I did not feel sick from the food I will NEVER return to this restaurant again!!! I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone!"
1,"FANTASTIC!!!\n\nMy Fianc\u00e9 and I just moved to Charlotte from DC and were a little worried about the restaurants in Charlotte compared to what we were used to in DC.  The Fig Tree was our first step into the Charlotte food scene and we were blown away!  First off, there were lots of things we wanted to try on the menu.  We settled on scallops and escargot for appetizers, house salads, grouper and filet for entrees and we split beignets for dessert.  I can honestly say I would order every single one again.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, the escargot were in a cream sauce (something I've never seen before but our waiter suggested it- he said it was so good we would be wiping the plate with our bread- and he was right!).  The side salads were even above par!  The grouper came on jasmine rice that was so flavorful.  My fianc\u00e9 ate every bite of his steak.  \nOn top of great food, our server was helpful in making choices, very friendly and on top of things.\nMy only complaint was the guy sitting next to us in jeans- come on, if you're eating dinner at a restaurant with $40 entrees, jeans are not appropriate!! But obviously that's not the restaurant's fault.  \nAll in all a great restaurant for a special occasion, we will definitely go back."
0,"In our culture \""you killed it\"" normally means a good thing.  Not so for Burger Palace...\n\nIn 2002 (when I moved here the first time) Burger Palace was one of the Top 5 Burger Spots in Las Vegas (I believe it was the RJ that voted them there).  This has changed.  I noticed there were no reviews for this once hidden gem in almost 6 months so I figured I would swing by and give them a try.  \n\nUpon entering my first thoughts were 'nothing has changed'.  This is still a dingy little cafeteria style diner with sports themed graphics on the wall consistent with a child's bedroom.  The tables are still a throwback to the 60's, but the more I think about it I doubt they are 'thrown back', more likely originals that need a remodel.\n\nI ordered the BurgerPalace combo... A hamburger, fries and a coke for the wallet strangling price of $9.14, tax included.  While the woman working the counter didn't flip me off or, to my knowledge, call me names in her native tongue, she wasn't exactly friendly either.\n\nNearly 20 minutes later I hear a thundering voice consistent with God over a loudspeaker \""Number 14\"".  Startled, I glance around and note that I am THE ONLY ONE IN THE RESTAURANT.  Apparently there is still a need for the microphone to avoid any potential mix ups on who's food is ready.\n\nThe hamburger-  Having killed numerous cows on the grill in my backyard, I instantly recognized the secret recipe of this masterpiece destined for a landfill: Low quality/high fat beef, salt, waayyy too much pepper.  At the first bite I knew my options were many for this hamburger not limited to paperweight, hockey puck, hammer, etc.  This certainly was not food, however. I truly believe that this poor burger was on the grill the entire 20 minutes I was waiting.  8 minutes would have been enough.\n\nFrench fries- While they had a golden appearance, they were definitely overcooked as well.  Upon biting into them, they almost snapped, oozing out the trapped grease, leaving me with an insatiable desire to immediately brush my teeth.  Game over.\n\nCoke- Hard to screw that one up.\n\nI ended up taking 2 bites of each item on my plate and exiting with my Coke.  My next stop was In-N-Out on Trop to help rid the memories of this experience.  My advice:  Do not eat here!"
1,"This was my ifrst experience with Rudy's and it was pretty good. My partner and I decided to go for lunch on Weds. We had prepared ourselves for the wait we had read about in the reviews but we were very happy when we arrived because there wasnt one. \nWe moved here from the south (Arkansas) and are always looking for some \""down home\"" cooking. I am a fan of Memphis style BBQ so I wasn't too fond of their sauces. We ordered 1/2 lb of brisket, pulled pork, and Baby Backs...corn on the cob, cream corn, potatoe salad, and beans. The brisket and baby backs were amazing but the pulled pork had too much pepper. All the sides were good except the beans...bland. My partner loved her cream corn. I like the way they serve you and I had to chuckle when i seen the white bread...brought back memories. Overall, we had good \""down home\"" food at a fair price. We will return:)"
0,"Maybe 3 stars for food because I went for brunch and I love the idea of ordering and having it cooked fresh. I enjoyed most of the food. I love the atmosphere of the place. Having said that, service sucked! Our waiter was inattentive. We went with two other couples and every single time we needed him we had to wave him down, which I don't like doing because I feel it's rude but he clearly was not coming back any time soon. And to make it worse he would listen to what one person needed and would run away without even asking did anyone else need anything and at times before the person speaking was done! One of the couples we were there with was there before and said service was bad as well. We almost felt unwelcomed. Maybe he was busy but we are all in the business that is the time to be apologetic about service not act like we are disturbing his day. We still left more than 20 percent just because of the fact we are in the business. I will probably give it another chance but have to say something if service is the same. Maybe sit at bar."
1,I love the entertainment here and the drinks are always ice cold! This is a great place to take some coworkers and friends!\nBruce was very accommodating for special events!
1,"We stop here every time we're at THEhotel or Mandalay it always exceeds expectations. If you want good pub food, good beer, a pleasant wait staff or an obscure Irish whiskey, you will get that, but just a little bit better because it's actually reasonably priced. The best value I've found in Vegas. Certainly the best value anywhere on Mandalay property."
1,"Mr. Puss got sick last month the day I had to leave town for a week for work. Estrella got me a rush appointment within 20 minutes of my initial call, took kitty in right away and carefully performed X-rays and blood tests. They sent me home with a bag full of meds (which my lucky pet sitter got to administer) and kept me up to date on test results via the phone. Once again I found them to be caring and responsive, and I will keep going back."
0,"I was very dissapointed, & will never go back!!!!!!!!!\nOn monday, March 14th 2011, my son & I went to Dessie B's because I had a Groupon that I paid $15 that gave me a voucher to get $30 worth of food. 3/4 of the way thru dinner,  my son found a hair in his food! We told the server, & she offered to get him another order of fries! Well, if you are like me, you are turned off, & you are'nt eating anything else!\nWhen I got the check, they did'nt take his meal off, & I was sitting there arguing w the manager! She offered that the next time we come in, he could get a kids meal comped, but that was'nt good enough for me, as I paid $13.99 for his steak & shrimp! She was explaining to me that my son ate 3/4 of his meal, & that comping him a kids meal would be fair! FAIR? He found a hair in his food! Then the waitress was arguing w me about the hair...are you kidding me? I told the manager not to worry about it, that I would pay for the whole bill, but that I would never come back! After arguing back & forth for about 15 minutes,she finally said,\"" I don't want you upset & took the bill from my hand & told me not to worry about it..that she will take care of it\""!  So as she is walking back to the kitchen, she proceeds to pick up my to go box & drink (that was sitting on the counter) to throw it out in the back!!!!!  I was just standing there up front watching her walk away!!!!! That was my food she took from me...it had nothing to do w me! And she also took my $30 voucher too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What a bad experience it was....\nThat was a big rip off, & I would suggest you never go there, cause if something is wrong w your food or you happen to find a hair...they prorate how much you have eaten, & give you the difference!!!!!!!!!!!\nI could'nt believe how a manager handled the whole situation!\nSHE TOOK MY FOOD...I paid for that voucher!!!!!! WHAT A RIP-OFF!\nSo, the bottom line was...I paid for two meals w my  $30 voucher that I paid for..1 meal had a hair..I paid for both, & then to top it all off...she takes my to go box that had my baked potato & a whole shrimp skewer!\nI lost on that experience...and you will too!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"The food is just superb. Loved the biryani !!\n\nAmbiance is quite amicable. The usual buffet is $10 whereas weekend buffet is around $14 with many  more dishes.\n\nThe south indian dishes (vada,idli,dosa) grt. I strongly recommend this place for 5 star food !"
0,"The food was disgusting and made me sick. The waitress had an attitude and looked like she'd rather be anywhere but there. I will never eat there again. Not worth it. The atmosphere was OK, you get over it after 5 minutes. I just wanted to leave. Plus the food is way overpriced. I would be happier eating a frozen dinner."
1,"Tried Brio for the first time tonight. It was good. I very much enjoyed my dinner and the atmosphere. Came in around 6:15pm and we were seated right away. Our waitress was attentive and got our drinks out quickly. I tried the berry acai Italian soda which was just okay, I probably would not get it again.\n\nThe bread that was brought out before our entrees was very good. A combination of sourdough and a crispy baked focaccia type cracker bread. My sister and I both had Caesar salads before our meal and they were great. I ordered the pasta fra diavolo which had campanelle pasta with a spicy vodka cream sauce and chicken. I asked for it extra spicy and it was delicious. My sister had the ravioli di bello which was a portabella mushroom ravioli with a mushroom cream sauce, I tried it and it was also very tasty. \n\nService was great throughout the meal. Food was wonderful. Prices are moderate but worth it. Overall good. I will be back."
1,"Such an adorable place! So bright and clean. \n\nI tried their Jive Turkey sandwich as well as their tomato, garlic and basil soup. Since I did the half sandwich and cup of soup combo, I wasn't able to have it toasted. So sad... The sandwich was very good, the soup not so much. I should have just ordered the whole sandwich and had it grilled. Oh well, now I know!\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Jive Turkey sandwich and had it toasted. It was SO much better! He also ordered a Puff Doggy with their homemade cheese sauce and it was delicious as well. The pastry was so flaky and light. You just have to make sure to have patience while they make it. Everyone in our group had their food for awhile before the delicious doggy was done. I think it was worth the wait though!\n\nNext time I will make sure to save room for some dessert. Their sweets looked amazing!"

0,"Habe mir echt lange \u00fcberlegt, ob ich hierzu eine Bewertung abgeben soll, aber ich dachte mir dann, vielleicht kanns ja als Konstruktive Kritik gelten.. Wir waren an einem Samstag nach dem Bummeln dort und ich war auch bestimmt in bester Laune, wir hatten den letzten Tisch ergattert, was ja auch positiv betrachtet bedeutet: der Laden brummt. So weit so gut Es dauerte lange bis der Service an den Tisch kamkann ich gar nicht leiden\nSp\u00e4ter wollte ich nachbestellen der Service war durch die guten Freunde an der Theke sitzend, abgelenkt  kann ich auch nicht leiden\nBezahlen --\u00e4hnlich Da der Laden aber echt voll war, scheint das keinen abzuschrecken  daraus nun meine Erkenntniss:\n-wer was von der Gatronomie versteht  dort nicht hingehen\n-wem aber allles egal ist, den Plausch mit dem Nachbarn sucht, gerne auch mal sinnversunken abtaucht  bittesch\u00f6n"
1,"I've heard a ton of buzz about this place around the main campus but never gave it a try until last weekend. The atmosphere in there is really interesting; walls and windows are painted black, good music with all different types playing.\n\nThe staff are very friendly, professional, and fun. I like that instead of wearing uniforms or name tags like most places, they are encouraged to wear normal street clothes which I think gives the place a moreto comfortable relaxed atmosphere.\n\nGreat selection of draft beers on hand behind the bar. I gave the meat and cheese a try, and was not disappointed! Really good combination of sausage and cheddar cheese inside a pastry. I will be visiting that place more often now for sure!"
1,"carne asada fries! fully loaded nachos! the grande breakfast burrito! these are the awesome things we get and split between myself, the husband, and a 3 and 1 year old. it's more than enough food to satisfy all of our appetites as well as any mexican food craving. i totally dig the salsa as well. it's nice to go somewhere and feed an entire family for around $10...and that includes a delicious horchata."
1,"I love the atmosphere.  I don't bowl, I just got to hang out on the patio.  The food is always good, and I love the live music on Fridays.  The band you had on 7/19/13 was awesome!!  This is a go place in the neighborhood to hang out."
1,"Super awesome! Quoted me $75-100 for a stereo install over the phone. Came in and they did it for $40, and super fast!"

1,"Psssst! Hey you...have you heard about South Seas Thursdays at Tiki Lounge in the Southside yet? No?! Well, let me clue you in to one of the best kept secrets in the Tiki underground of the 'Burgh. \n\nLucky the Painproof Man...yes, THAT Lucky, the one who Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museums have determined to the the #1 sideshow act in the world...AND the lovely grass-skirted Greta concoct and create AUTHENTIC tiki drinks made with top shelf rums and many other of only the best-of-the-best liquors, housemade AUTHENTIC falernum, orgeat and other tiki syrups and liqueurs and fresh-squeezed juices. Nope, these aren't the overly sweet, garishly hued cocktails that you used to THINK were tiki, these exotic cocktails are made from the recipes of none other than Trader Vic and Beachbum Berry and from various classic 40's, 50's and 60's tiki bars that created the laid-back, liquid lifestyle that is tiki.\n\nOn a recent Thursday my cocktail of choice was Planter's Punch - and yes, it certainly packed one. A punch, that is. I've also enjoyed a Hurricane - nope, not the Hawaiian punch-colored (and, unfortunately, flavored, too) sort, but a REAL Hurricane made with fresh-squeezed juices; a lovely Mai Tai; a Lucky original with coconut, coffee, rums and I'm not sure what else - amazing; a Jet Pilot; Grog...and so, SO many others. \n\nWhether your choice of poison is a Sufferin' Bastard, a Zombie (enjoyed by many on Halloween, no less!),  Singapore Sling, or a Mai Tai...whether it comes in a tiki mug or a glass adorned with colorful paper umbrellas, cherries, wheels and wedges of citrus, fancy straws or even a tall, spiky pineapple leaf...whether you come with a group or all by your lonesome, you WILL enjoy the cocktails and the company of fellow tiki-philes.  \n\nMaking Thursday evenings even more special are the exotic sounds of DJ Dr. Zombo who sets the tiki mood with South Seas sounds and surf rock. Gotta love those marimbas and jungle bird calls! And if you're REALLY fortunate, you might hit on a night when Dr. Zombo breaks out the guitar and joins fellow musicians for surf rock sounds by Vertigo Go!\n\nYou can get tiki drinks at the Tiki Lounge any day of the week, but ONLY on Thursdays from 4-9 pm can you get the best of the best of tiki cocktails made by masters. Need a get away? This is it! Sigh...I only wish EVERY night was a South Seas night."
0,"I would not go back to yogini again.  They are NOT honest people & quite confrontational.  They pulled a bate and switch on their pricing..  They told me I could pay there, on site, for a living social deal $19 unlimited yoga.  They took my $20.  I took the class, and now they  just called to tell me that I have to buy it through living social.  So, I have to pay another $19 to get this deal.  I just paid $20.   When trying to explain that the receptionist took my $20 with the verbal agreement of unlimited yoga for a month,  she hung up on me.\n    If I would have gotton the deal, I would have gone four times to feel I got my money's worth.  If I would have gotten the class for free I would not go back again.  So, what it comes down to is... this studio leaves much to be desired and to top it off they are not nice.  WARNINING. Do Not Go To Yoginis."
1,"Love Bryant!  No contract and no pressure.  They came out after we saw our first scorpion in our house since we moved in 3 years ago.  Price was reasonable, they arrived on time, and were very thorough.  I was impressed by the guy and there was no odor which was a concern for me.  We use them at my office every month and I would never use anyone else!"
0,"We were looking to grab dinner and one of my guests remembered this place favorably from her youth. We ordered there 11$ special. 1 chicken brochette, 1 cheese cannelloni  and 1 calamari dinner. Brochette was ok but a bit tasteless, cheese cannelloni was meh and the calamari was passable. The rice was awful. Can't recommend it."

Hot damn was it a disappointment...they discontinued the cheesecake bites!! WTF?!? And to rub salt in the wound...damn waitress says \""oh too bad those were delicious, you missed out!\""....freakin' hooker...sorry but I love me some cheesecake! Tried out a wrap and the bacon burger...they were just so so...would rather had a Sourdough Jack from Jack in the Box. Only real good thing to get here are their slushy drinks."
1,"Stopped in here for lunch today at the constant urging of a friend. I was told that this place has really great sushi AND a conveyor belt. My friend and I arrived at 11:15 am and we were the only people in the place which was okay as they open at 11:00 am and we beat the lunch rush. Suffice to say the only thing on the belt were California Rolls, edamame and pot stickers. We therefore ordered from the menu. We sat for quite some time waiting for more options on the belt.  Eventually something similar to a rainbow roll appeared and we tried that. Nothing more was added.\nThe food was good to me and I will definitely return when they are busy just for a variety of choices on the belt. My friend was not impressed at all. She felt as if they were over priced, portions were too small and the food was just ok. According to her if she returns it will be for the non-sushi items on the menu.  \nOverall, I think this is a cool sushi spot to bring a group of friends."
0,"During a very long layover here at Charlotte's Douglass Airport, I decided to check this place out because I did not want to leave the property.\n\nTop 40 on the speakers as you walk in, (one would expect to hear a feed of ANY sports station here) and a number of tv's tuned to all sorts of sports. pulled up seat at the bar, greeted with a smile and ordered a Stella... It came cold and quick.\nThe atmosphere is not impressive. The bar smells like a dorm room and the walls are noticeably dirty.\n\nI ordered a mushroom Swiss burger, I came before I could put the menu down... Scary... The burger was good, the onion rings ok, the pickle sad at best.\n\nBill was $32 bucks with burger and two stellas... \n\nIn summary if you are looking for a quick bite and a beer this is informal here you go... On an airport food scale 5 out of 10.\nGuess that shows where our standards are at..."
0,"Our food arrived in a timely manner, but when we opened the box, it looked like it had been dragged behind the car and the pizza was destroyed.\n\nOrdered the pizza with extra sauce and it had no sauce and no flavor.\n\nThe Appetizer Sampler had 3 jalapeno poppers, 3 mozzarella sticks, 4 un-breaded slivers of zucchini, two un-breaded onion rings and what looked to be the scrapings from the bottom of the deep fryer. Bleh!\n\nMy wife called to complain about the pizza and we were offered a credit towards a pizza in the future, but to be honest, I don't think we will ever go back."
1,Good atmosphere and ok service. The enchiladas stack was very good. Not super heavy with a ton of cheese. It was very fresh and flavorful. Their fresh salsa is really good. I think it was my favorite part of lunch. This service was a little slow but still we will be back:)
1,"The best steak I've had. Juicy, and cooked to perfection... Bone in rib eye more like cave man rib eye... Delicious steak flavor and bite no bs flavoring just meat at it's best... Great specials too but I think I'll stick with bone in rib eye and complimentary salad bar no need for sides. Pretzel bread also amazing"
1,"On a recent trip to Vegas with the boyfriend, we rented a car to go to the pinball hall of fame.  Completely worth it (and having freedom in vegas too).\n\nMany rows of WORKING pinball machines that were FUN to play.  Lots of different flavors of pinball to keep everyone in the group happy for at least an hour .. even longer if they're into pinball.\n\nA definite stop for each visit to vegas in the future.  Plan for at least an hour to explore.\n\nFrom the strip: Tropicana east a few miles, U-turn at Pecos, right into shopping center."
0,"I've been a Las Vegas local for about a year now, and I have done my best to eat my way around the city. If there is one thing that I have come to appreciate since moving here, is that hospitality and customer service is king.\nNow, I am the first to admit that I am a somewhat lazy Yelper, only really Yelping about something that is either really good, or really bad.\nHaving said that, this is yet another example of poor customer service ruining what could have been a great meal, but we never got that far.\nMy wife and I approached the hostess station, and the hostess looked up and made eye contact, without a hello, and waited for me to start speaking. The second I opened my mouth, she blurts out, \""I'll be with you in a minute!\"". It was as if she was setting me up, waiting for me to speak, just so she could shut me down.\nSo, I waited. Then when she was ready, she said \""Can I help you?\"", to which I started to ask what time they started serving dinner, but all I got out was \""What time do....\"", before she interrupted smugly with \""Do you have a reservation?\"".\nI managed to get out \""No, but....\"", before her final declaration...\""My first available is at 8pm\"", (it was 5:15pm) followed by a snooty stare that seemed to say, next time, think ahead, moron.\nMy wife and I walked away with our tails between our legs, embarrassed, and went somewhere else, where we had a great meal, then wrote this review.\nI'd have given them a one, but I threw in an extra star for having a great menu. I'll bet the food was good, but I'll never know."

0,"My wife and I had lunch.  we ordered the special, Philly cheesesteaks. The bread was so stale and had been left on the grill so long that the sandwiches were dry and inedible we had to request additional ranch dressing . After reminding the waiter twice we finally received our ranch dressing and some mayo.  The roast beef was so tough and stringy we finally asked for boxes and took our sandwiches home where we fed them to our dog who love them. However, the onion rings were superb."
1,"I'm talking about the dinner buffet here, never tried breakfast or lunch. The food is healthy, but the choice is limited. The location is great (on campus), generally a good place to have a big treat after exams or whenever you want to engorge. Also, each Wednesday it has special dishes. The price is fine (about $10). The suggestion is to provide more kinds of food."

1,"Stopped by 4 & 20 on a roadtrip through Wisconsin and it was amazing. The place is a little hard to find, it's behind Milo's and if there was a sign out front we didn't see it. Walking into the cafe there's the bakery section and ordering counter straight ahead and a couple of tables to the left. Not much seating, especially if you have a larger party, and it was completely full by the time we left. Decorations are really cute, with wall decals, local art on the walls, and fresh flowers on the table. The menu is short and sweet and I was a little worried I wouldn't be able to find something I liked, but we ordered a couple different things and they were all good. The soup of the day was Tomato Gazpacho and it was delicious.  Obviously made from fresh tomatoes and paired with cashews, which I've never had in a soup before but gives it an interesting texture. The Veggie Italian sandwich was the real winner - roasted summer squash, marinated buffalo mozzarella, baby arugula, tomato & giardiniera on ciabatta. Fresh cheese, fresh vegetables, slightly crunchy ciabatta, with a slight kick from the giardiniera... it was amazing. And I don't even like squash. The drinks (pineapple lemonade!) were good as well, and top notch service (the guy at the counter patiently answered all our questions and didn't miss a beat when we continued to add things to our order). Almost makes me wish I lived closer to Madison, just so I could get breakfast/lunch here!"

1,"Good & getting better! \n\nAt least terminal 4 is, lol. It's modern, clean, quite comfortable. It also has a great variety of restaurants & stores both before & past the security checkpoint. \n\nThe last time I was in terminal 2 was years back, & it was like a 70's flashback :( \n\nThose are the only terminals I've flown out of, so I can't comment on the others. \n\nWhen I pick someone up, I like the personal touch of parking and waiting for them outside their gate :D That runs me $4 for an hour parking in the garage. \n\nWhen I'm flying out and leave my car there, I use the East Economy lot. At $9 a day, it's reasonable and much more convenient than parking off site. The airport buses run through every 15 minutes or so and go to all the terminals. \n\nThe new PHX Sky Train is an automated train that goes between the 44th Street and Washington Valley Metro Light Rail, the East Economy parking area and Terminal 4 in it's first stage. I haven't had a chance to ride it yet, but it looks cool! :)\n\nThe airport website is actually really comprehensive and has tons of info. I'd recommend giving it a looksie! skyharbor.com"
0,"If you want to bank with a financial institution that have staffs that actually know what they are doing, don't come here!  They may have good intentions and want to protect their customers from fraud, but they also happened to be grossly incompetent or under trained to the point they can't even setup accounts they are recommending.\n\nCame in on three separate occasions to resolve this issue with their 'free' checking and savings account for making small debit and web purchases, but they can't setup the account correctly because the new accounts were never linked to the primary checking/savings accounts.  How I was able to setup monthly recurring transfers with the new accounts, I will never know.  To add insult to injuries, I never even received the card that I was supposed to use for said small purchases, while protecting the primary accounts. The first card probably got lost in the mail, as I moved shortly after and it probably didn't get forwarded to the new address.  The second one, I can't explain.  Maybe I should have made arrangements to physically pick it up from the branch, as they can't stuff envelops and mail it after forcing everyone to go paperless.\n\nAnyway, the staff are pleasant enough but have limited ability to refund monthly fees that were charged, except the immediate 3 months that they can view on their screen.  And after a lot of investigation and tracing the problem to issues linking these new checking and savings account to my primary ones, they said it was ultimately my responsibility for not monitoring my accounts. Never mind that they screwed up in the first place, or the fact that I have no access to it and no reason to monitor it.  Hell, I doubt some thief can fraudulently access the $200 ($162 after WF took their cut) in the account, if I can't even get to it.  And if they can, then hell they deserve it.  Escalated this to their new branch manager,and she also was unable to do anything, after promising to look into it.\n\nWorst customer service ever.  I am so pissed that I am going to close the accounts, take everything out as cash and stuff it under the mattress.  At least the balance will not mysteriously disappeared or result in a -18% return in under a year. If I want to see that kind of return, I can just buy bank stocks."
0,"This isn't really a British place, by any reasonable account. Normally such places have a lot of atmosphere & beer offerings are skewed towards things British, but here it is virtually like any other bar. There's a few golf items here and there, and the menu is golf themed, but it's pretty much just an ordinary bar.\n\nGuiness, Bass, Stella Artois, Hoegaarden, Weihenstephan, Newcastle, Smithwicks, a cider and others make the lineup of taps. No Fuller's, no Whitbread, not much at all that you would expect to find in a British themed place.\n\nFried food options basically, and it sets the aroma of the place as well."
1,"It is high time that I update my review for Soyo. It's been almost exactly a year since I first reviewed it and I've been back quite a few times since. Along with a plethora of other Yelpers, I absolutely love this place. No doubt, the food is great. But what makes Soyo such a great spot to hang out is the atmosphere. This is definitely a place you want to hit up with a few friends.\n\nSome of our faves...\n\n* Budae Jjigae aka Korean Army Stew - I never really understood why people love this so much. The first couple of times I tried it, it was OK. But this past Monday, that stew was completely on point. It just hit that perfect amount of heat to make you want to keep eating it. And let's face it. As Anthony M and Tien N can attest, it's filled with all the bad things you love--sausages, bacon, SPAM. It's a great stew to share among three of four friends. Don't worry if you can't find it on the menu. I never can either.\n\n* Fried Rice with Smelt Egg in a Stone Pot - I can never remember the exact name of this dish, but it's absolutely delicious. After they bring it out, make sure to let it sit for a few minutes to allow the bottom to crisp up. Then mix all that goodness up with a spoon before you dig in. It's worth the extra wait. The smelt egg really adds great flavor to this rice dish.\n\n* Chicken Wings - I don't remember the exact name of this dish either. It doesn't matter. They're insanely good. Props to Misti Y for ordering them. I wouldn't have tried them otherwise. The wings are bursting with flavor and you even get whole cloves of garlic for good and tasty measure.\n\n* Galbi Jjim (Korean Braised Short Ribs) - This is a dish I've only had once thanks to a recommendation from Jieun L. It's a bit on the pricey side at $15, but it was incredibly good. The ribs were flavorful and extremely tender.\n\n* Very Spicy Chicken - The level of heat on this dish has been hit and miss. In fact, I don't think I've ever had it at its legendary spiciness level, which is fine with me. In any case, this is a great choice. The mozzarella cheese isn't something you would expect in a Korean dish, but it's a stroke of genius. Delicious!\n\nI won't continue listing dishes ad nauseam. You get the point. As Jane K mentions in her review, Soyo is simply a fantastic place to hang out. A few hours with a few friends and perhaps a few bottles of soju. Now that's what I call a killer evening."

0,"I have stayed here many times, but I will now find somewhere else to stay.\n\nThe front desk people are never very friendly.  \n\nOur first room of this last visit was nasty.  The bathroom tile was coming up and the door hinges were rusty and the paint was coming off the wall near the tub.  The tub had grout coming off.  No continuing maintenance is going on.  \nOur A/C did not work and we had to be transferred at 11:30 pm to another room.  This means that the maid did not report it not working or that they did not fix it.\n\nOur second room was almost as bad.  The bathroom was in the same sorry shape, but the room was nicer.  \n\nThe Casino is always fun and great priced for being small and off the strip.  The pool can get a little crowded, but the pool bar and hooters restaurant overlooking the pool are fun.\n\nI won't be back until some remodel is done.  Going to try the \""New\"" Tropicana."
0,"We saw Ka over the Labor Day weekend and it was a complete waste of time. We have seen other Cirque Du Soleil shows and had high expectations, however, Ka was a huge disappointment. The show itself has such a poor plot about two siblings that are torn apart by a war... from there I have no idea what happened. We lost interest almost immediately and the music was putting us to sleep. \n\nIf the tickets aren't free with your hotel room, don't waste your money. \n\nSee the Beatles Love show instead."
0,"I've stayed here for two weeks so I figured out the place pretty well.\nPros: Customer service was good. Airport shuttles also take you to nearby locations within 4 miles of the hotel for free. The employees are friendly. The pool is great. The water is on the warm side.\nCons: The key cards here are INCREDIBLY BAD QUALITY. I had to get a new one almost every single day (for fourteen days, yes). They get demagnitized very easily and the door locks ALL seem to be barely in working order. I would have to always put my card in 3-5 times before they would work. One of the only two elevators doesn't have the floor number signal working and they both make weird noises. I got over my fear of slow strange sounding elevators quick. I guess I can thank them for that. WIFI IS EXPENSIVE. Hotels this bad really should have wifi to try to lure customers in that way. Why would someone pay so much for wifi if they had budget constraints leading them to settle to this hotel?\n\nNot worth it. Look elsewhere."
0,"The hotel isn't bad considering it's catering to the more mature audience.  The only thing that somewhat upsets me is that the price of the rooms are misleading.  You better read the fine print when reserving a room here because they might not inform you about the $14.95 per night surcharge.  Me and my friends wanted to find a fairly inexpensive hotel and when we booked online on expedia, the rooms were only $42/night.  But when we got there, we were informed of the ridiculous surcharge.  I can understand if it was something like $5.00 or something but $14.95?? If it was still summer time when we can at least use their ugly pool, i can also at least understand that.  I mean, even the GOLD COAST which is much more decent than Palace Station has a surcharge of only $3.00!  Okay, live and learn i guess.  Well, at least whoever is reading this could use the heads up, right? :)"
0,"After a long night of bar hopping in the vegas night clubs, some comfort food was a must. After waking up at the crack of dawn we Yelped online for a korean restaurant and found this place which had  a overall rating of 4 stars. ABSOLUTELY WRONG! You know when you're very hunrgy and anything you eat tastes great, in the case of this restaurant the food just RUINS your appetites. I ordered the mandu-ddukguk and my gf ordered the soft-tofu galbi combo. Now I'm not sure if it was because it was 7:30 am or maybe the chef wasn't there but my mandu-ddukguk was absolutely horrible. The soup base had a strange sour taste to it and  ruined my appetite. The soft-tofu tasted better then my soup but still wasn't up to par. The galbi that came out was of poor quality meat, the cut of the meat was fatty and had no real meat. Being Korean and living in downtown LA, great korean food is 5 mins away, I'm not usually a snob when it comes to korean food, but this was just horrible. Stay away!"
0,"Service was very slow, every table was filthy and our food was cold when it was served to us. Very disappointing. They weren't even busy and it was Sunday morning. Most restaurants are packed for Sunday morning breakfast. We now know why there were so few people. Dirty tables and cold food do not make for a good experience. In addition, the staff seemed very disengaged and seemed to be \""going through the motions\""  They didn't seem to want to be there. We won't be back. :-("
0,"I have eaten at GB many times over the past 5 years.  The food and service is actually very good.  I was given a gift certificate to eat there from my niece.  I have been there several times over the past two years.  I remembered that I had this certificate and called them to inquire about it.  They informed me that they had a 1 year limitation on the certificate and would not honor it after that.  I know that I should have used it prior to that.  But I don't carry it with me like cash.  It was only 40 dollars, but they should have honored it (in my opinion).  Shame on you GB.  I have been a loyal customer and have sent many of my friends to eat there.  Let me also say that it does not say anywhere on the certificate, that it expires in a year.  I won't be back.  Your won't miss me, because you are always busy.  But you must know that this response in regards to a mere 40 dollar gift cert. is petty."
1,"Crystals is a high-end shopping mall with brands like Louis Vuitton, Tom Ford, Hermes, Prada, Cartier, and the usual list of Fashion giants. The mall is extremely quiet and pleasant. The interior is more luxurious than any other shopping mall I have seen in the States and it's probably due to the fact that it was most recently built. If you are intending to go luxury shopping, there is no better place than the Crystals because they have the most prestigious shops than anywhere else. \nI stayed at the Aria hotel for a few days and Crystals is directly connected to the hotel. They also have monorails that run from the CityCenter to Bellagio, so you can hop on the monorail to get to places and it makes it convenient. One thing I found strange was that I found this mall to be quite hollow and empty. I am assuming that they have such a high concentration of luxury brands and that only attracts a smaller percentage of high-end shoppers. And in this kind of economy? Hmm.. Some people might find this uncomfortable, but I find this more pleasant. They have many restaurants like Mastro's, Social House, Jean George's Steakhouse, etc. They are all decent restaurants and you'll hardly have to wait to be seated. If you hit a jackpot, you should stop by Crystals."
1,"Just had a lunch there at 1:30. The place is inviting. The service was terrific. Ordered club sandwich, and it was good as well."
1,"Not a buffet, but really good restaurant overall. Definitely not a \""five-star\"" establishment in the traditional sense, but if you want good Chinese food at good prices with a true Chinese restaurant feel, this is a good place."
0,"Stale chicken! I lived in West Africa for a period and enjoyed the local \""tantie's\"" peanut sauce and foufou, but this place was a far stretch from good home cookin'.  It gives a bad impression of West African food, so don't pretend you like it just to be courteous and worldly-old chicken is old chicken.  The only redeeming part of the meal was the free appetizer of plantains.  Maybe... one day, Phoenix will have a good West African chop shop that doesn't use a can of veg-all in their sauce."
1,A solid lunch. They have a daily lunch special for $5.50 and all the other lunch items are $5.75. Well worth it. I will go back for sure.
1,"My brother, wife and kids were in town and spotted this as we drove and bombarded me with questions. It was good the last time I went, but it wasn't impressive that I was dying to go back. I was dreading a very ridiculous wait, but they said 20 minutes and it seemed like we got seated sooner than that. I guess in the recent year they've really ironed out their efficiency since our orders came swiftly was well.\n\nOrdered shrimp, crawfish, and clams in HNJ sauce, andouille sausage in hot butter, and one in lemon butter, half a dozen raw oysters, and rice. I've never been a fan of crawfish since it's a whole lot of shell for a little bitty nub of meat. The shrimp was big, juicy and perfectly cooked. The clams were pretty good but a few had a bit of sand still. I guess that's just a typical hazard with shells. After trying the sausages in other sauces, I still prefer the HNJ as my sauce- spicy and garlicky good. I was a tad miffed last time I came here with $2 rice being a piddly scoop- they made the serving bigger which they should. Asians rejoice!  My family liked this place so that's good. Sometimes being a Yelper everyone thinks you know ALL the things and I feel pressure being different in food taste too. \n\nService was great. Very friendly, checked on us often, fast about getting things. I really think the staff here has finally figured out a groove. Only helps them to faster turnover.\n\nOf course this is a messy experience, but if you don't like getting your hands all garlicky and seafood smelling, you can request gloves! My nephew wanted gloves so his hands don't smell. They give you bibs of course but this isn't the spot to wear something nice to and avoid long sleeves like white button downs. Cracking shells is a splatter hazard. \n\nYeah, this place is hyped to hell and I don't think is the greatest thing to happen to seafood like people make it out to be, but it is solid if you just want simple, fresh seafood. Sometimes clambake style food just hits that spot. If only it came with a sea view, I would feel complete."
0,"menu is fairly lacking, even for an irish pub, and a bit overpriced, but maybe they have to be to make the rent...although they seem to make it up in booze sales.  staff was a bit rude and non-existant at times, but not much else around hre for irish pubs.  the guiness was good, but hard to screw that up I guess!"
0,"damn, I just got ripped off.  went thru the drive-thru at around noon, got home and realized that what is usually fresh orange chicken is last night's left overs, heated up.  the first nugget I bit into was so hard, I cracked a tooth.  I wish I had another $10 to go spend at el pollo loco.  FML, shouldn't have trusted the PANDA today...."
1,Best shaved snow I've ever had so far (from LA to HK)!! The various shaved snow options are so flavorful! Came with some friends and we all got different flavors to try; not one of us were disappointed with our selections. Love that this place is so unique and experimental with their flavors! Will be a must go place every time I come back to Vegas!!
1,"I ate here with a group of friends from out of town on Saturday night.  The atmosphere was good and we sat at one of the larger round tables below a chandelier that looked like \""it could kill all of us at once\"", a friend noted.\n\nSince I was at an English pub, I selected the small order of Fish & Chips and I was fairly impressed by the size of the cod and the right amount of breading fried enough where it wasn't too greasy.  The fries or 'chips' were standard, but the fish was good and large enough for me to be happy.  I even took one of the large pieces home for the wife.  My friends got a myriad of things and they all had good things to say due to the large portions, especially the nachos.  Another English-fare eats include Bangers and Mash from what I remember.  \n\nAfter dinner, we went to the rooftop and had a drink or two.  It was a nice night for it, and the lighting was good and we had a friendly server upstairs who offered a sample of beer that we weren't familiar with.  I would come back if I was in the mood for English food and rooftop scene in Fort Mill."
1,"I love Sambalatte.  This is just what Vegas needed.  It is a beautiful, relaxing place with great tea and a wonderful staff.  Great place to hang out working on your computer, for a business meeting or for an outing with friends and family."
1,"This cafe has a special place in my heart. It is not only where I had my first date with my first boyfriend (now first ex), but it is the very place that made me turn into the die-hard biscotti and coffee lover/aficionado that I claim myself to be now. \n\nSeriously, the best espresso is served here. I have a piece of Caffe Italia in my home, a bag of their home roast beans. Some people can't stand Italian coffee for its strong bitterness, but I enjoy every sip of it. The biscotti comes on a small heated plate, dare I say, saucer. The original is usually chewier, owing to its less-hard texture. I believe this cafe is where I first ate a whole biscotti, and from then on, I began to express my devotion and love to biscottis by ordering them in any cafe across Montreal that sold them.\n\nWithout a doubt, Caffe Italia will be one of the landmarks of Montreal that I shall miss after this year. I shall miss the drinks and sweets, but also the wood panelling, the multiple photos of the cafe's interior and exterior since its founding, framed posters of famous F1 competitors, the Crucifixion cross above the unisex washroom, Italian men crowding around the TVs, the outdoor tables, and even the occasional man in the back writing away like some serious poet or philosopher."
0,"We went here last night to get a late night snack. \n\nI ordered the shrimp balls. I didn't care for them. They were like a shrimp sausage meatball. I was hoping for more like whole shrimp. They were probably made the traditional way, so they may be good to people who are expecting that. But I didn't care for the texture nor the flavor. The dipping sauce was pretty good though.\n\nMy wife ordered the red bean shaved ice. It was okay. The flavor was decent and reminded me of red beans and rice. I'm not a fan of tapioca pearls though. I don't like the consistency. Again, it was probably made traditionally and may be enjoyable if that's what you liker expecting. But it's just not my thing. I'm kind of weird about consistency.\n\nWhile I'm not giving a great rating, it's based more on my personal preferences. I wouldn't dissuade people from going there if they like boba drinks. Just not my thing."
0,"There were 3 of us on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Surprisingly Roland's was 3/4 full. With 3 waitresses. They were RUNNING to fill orders. \nThe fish was hot and crispy. It was fried but it was good. The French fries with it tasted as if they were fried in the same grease or an oil that should've been changed several days ago. \nThe Mussels were OK. \nBut the Clams Casino were inedible. The clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping. The crab cakes were also bad. Both went back.  The waitress never asked if we wanted something else or if the rest of the meals were fine. \nThe New England Clam Chowder was good but overpowered by the smoky bacon that was added to the soup. \nNo, we won't go back..the food was lackluster(better fix at Wholleys) and the service was terrible. It took 20 minutes to get someone to take the bill."
0,"Ordered grilled veg taco, veg burrito. It tasted like leafs and beans and they did not add cream, cheese, salsa nothing in it (no spice at all in Mexican food huh!). Didn't eat my food left the place after paying my bill. Will i recommend this place, LOL. One should try it to believe it. Probably was a bad day for me..."
1,"This was my first Rock N Roll event, and after doing a few other big races I was psyched to finally check out a Rock N Roll. I figured expensive as it was, there must be something special about it, right!? Ummm, its just like any other race. I ran Las Vegas a few years ago before Rock N Roll bought it out and I did not really see a difference other then the price and Brett Michaels. I was expecting a cool shirt, come to find out everyone gets a men's size shirt. I ordered a small and I swim in it, oh well, into the heap of ugly running shirts it goes. \n\nI got to my corral, and could not figure out how to get into it, everything was gated off all the way around. A lot of runners were wandering back and forth trying to find a way into the damn corrals. I saw like 20 people just give up and hop the barrier, and followed right after them. Corrals could have been better organized...\n\n...and while we're talking about corrals, walkers, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE! If you are a walker don't freaking lie and clog up the course, get in the back and move it slo mo!\n\nI spent a large portion of time weaving around people walking 4 and 5 abreast blocking the entire course. Seriously? I finished in 2:05 and I know I could have broken 2 hours if I hadn't been forced to come to a dead stop on more than one occassion because of traffic.\n\nSeeing all the Elvises, hotels, people getting married, and awesome cheerleaders and volunteers is what really makes this race worth running again, even if it is 20 degrees out! Next year I'm starting in a closer corral and breaking 2 hours!"
1,"Rayner's first came on my radar a couple of years ago thanks to mentions by friends.  I've become a real fan once I tried it.  It's hard to decide my favorite food offering there:  pastries?  handmade chocolates? Delicious lattes?  Outstanding soups? Tasty sandwiches?   I must face it, I love them all!"
0,"I just moved out after living here for just 6 months, Thank God. It was quite an experience.\n\nWhen I moved in, I had cockroaches in my kitchen. I saw and killed 5 within a week! After I told management, they eventually fumigated - but only after I killed a handful more. \n\nAlso, when I moved in, a bunch of things were broken or things didn't work properly. When I delievered the \""evaluation of the apartment\"" form, I expected that most of them would be fixed. However, I called two weeks later to see why they didn't come in and fix them and it turns out they lost my paper, so they didn't know what was broken but they never asked me to fill out another one!\n\n4 months went by with little to no aggravation.\n\nIt was only in the last month that I experienced even more turmoil.\n\nIn the morning, a random guy will be in the dumpsters shifting through your trash. Why you may ask? Because the management never closes the gate, so anyone can walk in at night. Seriously, the front gate (which normally requires a passcode) was left open 90% of the time I lived there. I eventually forgot the passcode because there was no need to remember it anymore!\n\nDays before I moved out, my bike was stolen from me. For 5 months and 25 days, my bike had been locked up against the stairs to my apartment. When I moved in, I specifically asked if the bike would pose a problem, to which management said no, that it was completely fine because people left out grills etc. So when I called up the management to see if they would help in anyway, she let me know that the it was not her duty to help me and that I should not have left my bike outside of my apartment.\n\nNot to mention gas syphoning, rude management, dirty pools and limited parking.\n\nGood luck if you choose to live here!"
0,The food is right out horrible. The prize is too high. I had eggs over medium and they were super runny.  The hash browns were undercooked. \nThe service is disorganized. We got asked for drinks twice within a couple minutes. \nStay away from this place.
1,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!\nWe lost power in a few rooms when the storm hit early this morning. Could've been due to the storm, or maybe just coincidence. Having never hired an electrician in LV before, I went with the first name on Yelp that had 5 stars. Matt & Tim Eckerdt both came out within hours. They did the troubleshooting & fixing really quickly and didn't charge me an arm & a leg. Not knowing what to expect, their pricing was substantially lower than what I thought it would be. Very down-to-earth nice guys, too!\nWill definitely use again for future projects."
1,"Very impressed with this place, our server was amazing. The tapas were incredible and loved the sangria!!!"
0,"So, I'm a hookah fiend. I have one at home and probably smoke it almost on a daily basis. My friends have hookahs so I can smoke it their houses. All in all, everyone I basically know has one and we always smoke it together whether just to chill or when we have a pahteeeee. \n\nI started coming to Paymon's years ago. The hookahs were always real good and didn't taste burnt. The guys would come around to make sure the hookah was still hitting well and constantly replaced the coals. The happy hour all day Tuesday was the best with half off hookahs and lots of drinks to choose from.\n\nNowadays, I hardly ever go here, because the hookahs are always burnt and die really fast. The service is lacking now - I literally have to wave my hands in the air and do a little dance to get someone's attention. The drink refills dont come fast anymore so I'm always contemplating if I should just order two drinks instead of one. \n\nI used to like the other location on Maryland Pkway better, but I always came here due to distance. The other location is just the same now - the hookahs arent's as great. I'd advise you to just smoke at home where you'd get the best service haha"
1,"I had dinner with a large group on Tuesday night and was so highly impressed!  I just returned from my honeymoon in Italy a couple of months ago and was impressed by the quality and authenticity of the food here.  The homemade pasta's, gnocci, and sauces were well executed.  The texture of the pasta was as good as any handmade pasta I enjoyed in Italia.  The tomato and Buffalo mozzerella salad was absolutely spectacular.  I don't know where there tomato's come from but they were bursting with juicy flavor, as fresh and ripe as any tomato this native Phoenician has ever enjoyed in the Valley.  The Mozzerella was of the highest quality and the olive oil and fresh herbs were fabulous.  \n\nThe entire service staff was awesome and we never had to ask for refills etc...\n\nThere have been a few knocks on the portion sizes, and everyone is entitled to their own feelings on this topic.  For me, I prefer quality over quantity any day and I found the portions to be just right.\n\nGive this new joint a chance!  You will not be disappointed!"
1,"This is my 1st AYCE sushi spot in Vegas & I must say I was not disappointed at all. I'm pretty picky when it comes to sushi places esp for AYCE and who runs the establishment. I hardly do tables and usually am at the sushi bar. But this time around we wanted to see why Goyemon was so highly reviewed/rated & gave it a test run. \n\n:: Pros ::\n1) A typical roll comes in 8 pieces and this AYCE spot lets you do 1/2 orders!! So you get to try more variety of their other items and not have to commit to an 8 piece roll\n2) Reasonable prices with an extensive menu (specialty rolls, baked rolls, deep fried rolls, tempura rolls, nigiri sushi, side dishes, desserts) \n3) Delicious lychee ice cream i've ever had w/ lychee bits within!\n4) Check out for their new menu addtions written on their board that's included in the AYCE \n\n:: Cons ::\n1) You're only allowed 1 order of Uni & Amaebi per person for your dining session. \n2) They really skimped out on the uni sushi too :\\\n3) Can't order sashimi\n\n\n:: Notes ::\n1) Beware the menu states for AYCE: lunch per person/45 min & dinner per person/60 min. I'm sure they'll let you sit longer if they're not super busy packed \n2) They do have flat screen tv available by the sushi bar for those who wants to catch the game & food at the same time \n3) Pick up a frequent diner stamp card! Get 10 stamps & 11th AYCE is FREE! There is an expiration date of one 1 year from the first you got it stamped\n\nI definitely wouldn't mind coming back to Goyemon. It's a clean/modern establishment. Food & service was up to par especially for the price you pay!"
1,Upsells.  Only need to say no then they drop issue.  \nI like 10th wash free\nHad windshield replaced in past. Got month of unlimited basic washes
0,"When I moved to the valley 14 years ago, University Animal Hospital was recommended to me for boarding.  They were too far away from where I lived to go to for vet visits.  I took one of my dogs there for years until she passed away.  I got two more dogs and started boarding them there as well until I came home from a trip to find 5 staples in one of my dogs hip with no explanation as to what happened other than \""we came in one morning and found her bleeding\"".  The best part - I was billed for the surgery.  Really?  They finally refunded me my money for the surgery and the management was responsive after I called.  But, I've never gone back.  This wasn't a small cut - it took 5 staples (STAPLES) to close the wound.  My regular vet tended to her afterwards.  This was a few years ago and I wrote a review on Google at that time.  But now with yelp it deserves being mentioned again."
0,"My favorite Middle Eastern restaurant in all of eternity is Haji Baba in Tempe. Is it any wonder, then, why I am so deflatedly underwhelmed by MBFGR? If you want a real hamburger, you don't go to Denny's, you go to Chuck Box. My analogy stands. Totally bland and mediocre food, flavors distilled to barely detectable levels for the masses. The saginaki is good, but not bursting with tangy lemony sizzling energy like it should. The server's half-hearted \""opa\"" was fitting. They don't even light it next to the table anymore, making me wonder if their liability insurance put the kibosh on such activities after a particular incident, maybe or maybe not involving the singing off of a customer's facial hair. The spinach salad was absolutely coated in a syrupy balsamic dressing that was practically cloying in its sweetness. The pita is good, although its thick, spongy, white-bread consistency isn't particularly what I expect in a good pita. The sangria was a tick superior to Boone's. Meh all around."
0,"Wow!  These reviews are shocking.  Maybe I just went on a bad afternoon.  I'm not going to say how bad the food was, but instead I'm going to try it again - just to see if its me, or the food!\n\nWell the fried spinach tasted like sheets of greased toilet paper (if you can imagine that) and the mash potatoes had a stronger metalic after taste.  Everything about the potatoes said \""don't eat me!\"".  The fish wasn't too bad, however.  \nThe waitress stood right behind me and was bascially shouting in my ear, so much so that I moved my seat.\nBut its a real cute place, and the wine was excellent!"
0,"The young lady out front, seated us immediately, she was great! But once we got in, it took the man about 10 minutes to even acknowledge us. Once he did and asked for our ID and basically offended my friend because her ID hair was dark brown, and she'd recently went to light brown! We ordered the happy hour nachos, wings, guacamole, and quesadillas. The guacamole was fantastic. They do give chips and salsa as a courteousy, but the salsa was only so so. They gave me 3 chicken wings! I mean i understand it's the happy hour menu, but 3 wings is just wrong! The nachos were TERRIBLE!!!! The chese tasted like powdered chese, i immediately spit it in my napkin. The waiter saw the whole thing of nachos still on the table and he didnt even ask if everything was alright. He never checked on us, and i NEVER got the salt that i asked for when he brought the chips and salsa. The waitress that was assisting nearby tables wouldnt even look our way. You could tell it was one of those restaurants where they only help their assigned tables. For about 10 minutes we waited for our waiter, then for another 5 minutes we were just waiting to see any staff so we could get our bill. We finally waived down the hostess who had to go get our waiter. Needlesss to say, i did not leave a tip, no one in that restaurant deserved one, accept the hostess actually!! WILL NEVER GO BACK, there are too many restaurants in Vegas to put up with that!!!"
0,This is the slowest pharmacy ever. They go from one phone call to another completely ignoring the customers who are waiting in person. They quote wrong wait times which are often doubled. I'm not sure what makes them so much slower than other pharmacies.
0,"I'm sitting in my car waiting for a pizza that was promised 15 minutes ago.  Hope it's good because a second chance is unlikely.  Called 45 minutes ahead for a good 'za to take home for movie night, waited until they told me it would be ready and here I sit.\nThe pizza finally comes with appropriate apologies.\nCan't argue about the quality of the pie: Schreiner's sausage, tasty mushrooms, MJ crust  - all good - but it's a pizza.  You shouldn't have to wait at the pickup window longer than it takes to make the pizza from scratch.  \nEven the best food tastes bitter after a bad experience with service."

I found out that my initial hotel room didn't have it and (after a VERY rude encounter with a front desk woman) was told they would have a new room for me by 12:00 today WITH wireless internet. After going through 3 different concierge people, they finally found a different room for me by 6:30pm.... It was filthy and STILL no internet. Moved to a THIRD room.

1,"When one thinks of the Wild West, the state of Arizona is usually close to the top of the list. Playing an important part in the development of the Southwest, Arizona has some wonderful places with historical significance for all you history buffs.\n\nThe Vulture Gold Mine is one of these places. Just outside the town of Wickenburg, the Vulture Gold Mine was discovered in 1863 by Henry Wickenburg. Although Henry sold the mine after a few years, the mine went on to become the most productive gold strike in the history of Arizona and sparked the development of Arizona and the city of Phoenix.\n\nThe fee to participate in the tour is $10, but it is a small price to pay for the sheer volume of information and artifacts that are on the property site. The tours are self paced and on-your-own. When you visit the tour center, you receive a comprehensive overview of the mine and it's history from the current caretaker, as well as a map that identifies the points of interest.\n\nMost of the buildings, while in various states of disrepair, are still standing. Many contain original furnishings, machinery and reminders of everyday life such as cooking utensils, cans and bottles for coffee and such. One such building with a large variety of these items is the Assay Office, where the gold was stored prior to shipment. \n\nThere are some areas of the mine that are not open to the public, but since my grandfather worked at the mine, the caretaker gave us full reign to wander all over the property. The schoolhouse where my Uncle John attended school is still standing and contains a piano that we are certain he played as a child. The swings, slide and teeter-totter are still there and my mom could recall memories about those days despite the fact that she was just a toddler when they lived at the mine.\n\nIf you ever have the opportunity to visit the Vulture Mine, take it. I am an Arizona native with family ties to the mine and I still learned a ton of information about what an important part the mine played in Arizona's history.\n\nPS - While you are there, don't forget to scratch Olive the burro's ears!"
1,"Everyone loves a good trip to the theatre, and each time I have been in Edinburgh, I have used the Edinburgh Playhouse.  I went a couple of years ago to see 'Fiddler on the Roof', which was very well put together and thoroughly enjoyable in itself.  As a theatre, this venue does not disappoint.  There's all the little details that help make a trip to the theatre memorable, for me at least.  \n\nThe ornate decoration of the auditorium.\nThe slow dimming of the house lights as the show is about to begin.\nThe safety curtain that only seems to come down in the interval, and is never down before the show, which always confused me.\nThe ice cream sellers in the interval, who serve small tubs of pretty expensive ice cream.\n\nThe Playhouse has been around in Edinburgh for a long time, and I hope that there are many more years to come at this great venue.  Although theatre tickets are not amazingly cheap, it is well worth a visit, if even just for the experience."
0,The food there was okay. I had a salmon dish there. I don't eat beef so I can speak for their steak.

I had never been to a Kneaders before, but I have to believe that management has to do with the poor food quality.  The sandwiches aren't cheep, but I will pay for a quality ingredients. Not so with the Ruben sandwich I bought. First thing I thought was 'where's the beef'?  I opened the sandwich to find 2 extra thin slices of pastrami in it!  Awful. I also ordered a broccoli soup and requested some cheddar cheese. The manager told me he didn't have any. Cut and dry! My order was to go so I didn't get to complain about the sandwich.  I also bought some pastries. The double chocolate brownie and chocolate chip cookies were good, as was the raspberry croissant.  But the chocolate croissant was terrible. There was a scant amount of chocolate in it!  Pastries were expensive. \n\nIf the manager thinks that his profit margin will be bigger by skimping on ingredients, he's in for a big surprise. I will not be going back!  I think a lot of people will feel the same way!"
1,"Like Chris and Jason mentioned before me, this place is a great and affordable way to get you and your 20+ friends, girlfriends, boyfriends, lovers, buck fuddies, etc a place to sleep and recharge in Vegas. Relatively walking distance from the strip and even a cab ride wouldn't be too pricey on those nights/days of immobile intoxication.\n\nThis place is also great for last minute bookings on not so busy nights. A group of us were able to get a room for $30... booked the day of. Awesome sauce!"
0,hi...do you knw thy closed all of a sudden....\nI joined last week....and this monday whn i go thy are shut down.....i really loved the pilates n Yoga class.If you knw any place where Jeniffer trains...iw ud lik to join tht fitness studio
0,I am only giving two stars because of the actual vet herself. Jade Tenberg was the first vet in four years to spend time talking to us about Gidgets skin condition. That's another story though. We are thankful to her for actually caring about her condition and our talking to us about our options. It is the front desk that is ridiculous and not just one time but every single time I have ever had to call. If you make an appt. I highly recommended calling to confirm what day and time they actually scheduled you for. I would also recommend calling to confirm what they put down for the reason for the visit. So far I have had to correct them almost every single time. The other issue is the check in and check out time. They are sooooo slow and have no idea what they are doing. Bansfield should be embarrassed. As far as the wellness plan it is over priced and a scam. You are better off going to a regular vet not inside of a Petsmart. Today was the final event and I am calling to cancel my plan with them and finding a different vet.
0,"So.. Ordered takeout.. Got home to wrong order.. An inconvenience, but we go back to get our actual order.. 45 minutes late, we get home with our order... and it's screwed up....  I like red robin.. This one seems to have some issues.. Have experienced some issues while eating in as well.. Only gave them another chance because I got a gift card for Christmas....won't be back..."
1,"Dr. Kim is excellent. He is my primary care doctor and has been caring for my family for three years now. Office staff are wonderful, the facility is new, updated, clean, and comfortable. Dr. Kim's bedside manner is great, and he always shoots straight without sugar coating it. I respect him, and I recommend his office to anyone looking for a good doctor."
1,"I'll admit that when I first saw that CherryBerry was opening, I thought to myself that all these fro-yo places are getting out of control.  However, I still decided to go and I'm glad I did.  I'm a big fan of Yoforia and Menchies, but not really any of the other places. But now, CherryBerry has been added to my list of regular fro-yo places.  Although I still like Yoforia the best, CherryBerry has some different flavors than I haven't seen anywhere else...and they're good."
1,"This is my second visit to a Brazilian style steakhouse.  (The first being Rioz in Myrtle beach)  This is not a place for vegetarians, but their salad bar is nice as well.  (Fresh mozzarella or prosciutto anyone?)  \n\nI took my boyfriend for his birthday in early November.  The food was amazing and the service top notch.  It is a bit costly, making it a \""special occasion\"" type restaurant, but you can lessen the blow by signing up on their website for e-mails and you will receive a $20 off coupon."
1,"Before coming here I read the reviews on yelp and was not expecting much, however upon arriving I was very pleasantly surprised.  Today is my first day here, and I'm excited for the rest of my stay.  Although Mandalay Bay is on the edge of the strip and far away from the action, the casino is still packed, and the restaurants certainly have business.  Mandalay Bay is definitely not outdated or dull, the entire resort is beautiful.\n\nCheck In: Checking in was no problem, I checked in around 3:00 and there was a short 3 minute wait.  The lady who helped me was very nice, and got me the room/view I wanted.  In front of the check in desks there's a mini aquarium with lots of colorful fish and some small sharks where kids can wander as the parents check in.\n\nRoom: I'm staying in the standard room and it's quite nice and spacious!  I have a view of the strip which is pretty and nice.  There's a pretty good size flat screen tv which is great, and there's a pretty big glass table with a chair.  Attached the headboards of the beds there's a light that you can move and use to read.  The room has 2 good size closets with many coat hangers.  The bathroom is absolutely amazing, they have a separate bath and shower and 2 sinks with lots of counter space.  There's a separate tiny room and door for the actual toilet, that has a phone in it.......interesting. The best thing about the bathroom is that there's a mini tv in there so I guess you could soak and watch.  Although I think taking baths in hotels is unsanitary I still use the tv when I'm getting ready.\n\nRestaurants/Buffet: The buffet isn't really on the pricey side, and the food is pretty good. It's not absolutely amazing, but I definitely don't regret going.  Mandalay Bay has a nice selection of restaurants, but they're pretty dang pricey.  There are 2 Starbucks on the casino/restaurant level, and also a yogurt place if you're looking for just a quick snack.\n\nOverall I'm pretty pleased with my experience so far."
0,"I would absolutely give my server 5 stars.  That's why this review is so hard to write.  She was attentive, kind, and an all around sweet heart. \n\nThe food however was bland and boring.  I have never seen a chop house/seafood restaurant with so little seafood in my life.  I ordered the king crab artichoke open faced sandwich.  I had really high hopes for the sandwich since it had all of my favorite ingredients.  \nCheese? Check \nCrab? Check\nArtichoke? Check\nSourdough? Check\n\nIt takes great skill to take all of these ingredients and throw them together in such a way that I really have a hard time describing just how uneventful the sandwich was.  \n\nThe rest of the menu looked even less intriguing than this sandwich.  \n\nDecided to have some Creme Brulee.  I am a huge fan of this dessert but was so let down again.  The consistency was there but they do not use real vanilla (just extract) so there is not a ton of flavor.  I also tasted the grainy texture of the sugar that had not completely caramelized.  Pretty difficult to make a Creme Brulee taste boring.  \n\nGood job Kincaid's.  You've managed to accomplish what only a T.G.I. Fridays could."
1,"Gotta gotta gotta come here on a Sunday afternoon around 1p. Around this time they have something called the \""Tam Tam\"", this is where a bunch of strangers come to play their drums and make their own music. All you have to do is listen out for the drums and that will take you to the \""Tam Tam\"".\n\nThe park is also filled with people doing activities such as tight roping, hackysack, music, old war fighting with plastic swords, etc... \n\nBesides all of the activities you can take a mile and a half walk to the top of the park there you will get a great view of Downtown Montreal. Keep in mind the walk might get a bit tiresome. \n\nPark is also a nice place to take your bike and go for a stroll as there are lot of trails to visit."
0,"Got my nails done here and by the time I got out the door I needed a fill in   What a scam. I went to get my fill the next Saturday and they asked me if I wanted them thick like this again.  Half the time I was getting them put on the guy was watching what was going on behind him.  I went to Dolly's across from sky view high, had them done and it's been a week and they still look great. I think I'll get 3 weeks out of these AND they look totally natural not like little blobs of acrylic on the tips of my nails."
1,I remember going there to eat a short while back. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and was not disappointed in the least. The portion was generous and the price was reasonable. The waiter was courteous and friendly. The food was delicious.
1,"I had a voucher for 2 brunches for \u00a37 instead of \u00a314.  We called ahead and booked a table and got the cutest wee booth with a little hatch to the bar which we got drinks passed through.  \nI really like the feel of the place.  I have been to events upstairs but this was my first experience of the public bar. \nWe have friends in the USA who are planning a trip to Scotland and this is definitely somewhere we will be bringing them.  It is full of charm and decent food and surroundings.  \nI had the veggie breakfast which had veggie haggis, beans, potato scone, mushrooms, scrambled eggs, fried bread and toast. My husband had a regular Scottish breakfast which had haggis and bacon too.  \n\nThe latte was very smooth and had a little design in the foam on top.  \nI really liked it here and I will certainly be back.  \n\nMake sure your not in a rush as not the quickest but very tasty."
1,"Lots of cool art from around the world here. Such a colorful shop, a real treat just to visit. You will be hard-pressed NOT to purchase anything, every trinket is so tempting.\n\nWhat really makes this place are the people who work here. They are friendly and will let you play with, try on, mess around with pretty much anything, all in a kind way. Of course they hope you buy it, too. ;)\n\nHad fun playing with the lucha libre masks and hand percussion."
1,"Find yourself in a winning streak? I'm sure this mall will clean your wallet out with no problems. A good variety of upscale stores with some mid to low end stores to appeal to any customer. If you're determined to shop your head off, this is definitely the stop for you. \n\nThere is a fun touristy vibe if you're into that, but there are times during high season when you feel like a sardine in a can and it's really just a lot of frowning."
1,"This is real food! How can anyone say its bad food. This isn't a fancy place it's a just a good good place. The people there are nice. I think sal is the owner, super nice guy."
0,"THIS PLACE IS AWFUL!!! They're beautiful apartments, but the staff is BEYOND DISGUSTING. We went in, applied, we're told everything looks good, turn ur power on in the apartment.  Then we were suddenly denied and Michelle,  the manager treated me like crap. She talked down to me like I was trash, she completely changed her story, was no longer nice,  she was very condescending and I have never felt more worthless,  like I didn't belong in a nice place ever in my life. Then I called corporate because how our situation was handled was hideous. And Greg, the gentleman I spoke to was just as bad. They made up a bunch of shit on why we didn't get approved and he had such an attitude when I was just asking for an explanation, it was ridiculous. If you're not obviously flashing money everywhere,  and if you're not fancy and stuck up, you're gonna get treated like shit. Im seriously looking into how to go above corporate because I am beyond insulted."
1,Had them move me a few days ago for the second time in two years. Both times were amazing. I went with them due to affordable price and family recommended.  They were spot on both times with flawless service. I didn't get the owner either time but his 3 man crew both times were friendly and quick and didn't harm our brand new home. clearly the only person who didn't give 5 stars so far is the competition or had a miscommunication on their end...because I got multiple followup calls and confirmations.
1,Good place to study and have a nice drink. They also have Ramen in case you get hungry. I have not tried it but may next time I go there.
1,"I will start off by telling you that Dr. Cherrington and his staff are amazing.  This is by far the best dental experience I have ever had.  \nI moved to Las Vegas 3 years ago and have not been to a new dentist in 30 years. \nEveryone was very nice.  They really made you feel comfortable and at home.  \nI called and was able to get an appointment to get my teeth cleaned in 2 days!  Once I got to the office, my time in the office was very minimal before they took me back into the exam room.  As a newbie, they showed me around  the office, where all te equipment was sterilized and the exam rooms.  All of the equipment was top of the line and up to date!  \nMy cleaning was quick and painless.  After the cleaning, the doctor came into the room and explained my xrays, in detail.  I was in an out in less than an hour!  Did I mention that I left with a new patient goodie bag?  Yep!  \n\nI also have to mention that as I was getting my cleaning, I could hear the doctor in the next room with a little girl, getting a filling.  He was amazing with her.  He kept talking to her, telling her how cute her shirt was and having a complete conservation with her as if she were a little adult!  He even high five-d her after her filling!\nGreat off and a great staff!  Highly recommended!"
0,"No STARS. It wouldnt let me post without choosing.  NO CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS!!! I WOULD RATHER PAY EXTRA ELSEWHERE FOR BETTER SERVICE. \n\nThe greeter was the only positive aspect of my visit to Budget. My husband and I were the only people in line with 3 agents assisting customers. At least 20 mins later one of the agents finishes up with their guest, but instead of calling us over he proceeds to leave his station to chat with the greeters for a few mins as if we were never there. He finally calls us over asks for our info and NOT once does he make eye contact with me throughout the process. I hand him our info, and when he is done with this he tosses it back. DID I NOT HAND MY INFO TO YOU??!! RUDE. He pulls up the 2 reservations I made, I chose the one I wanted. Even after choosing the one I wanted HE STILL CHOSE THE WRONG ONE!! I am beyond frustrated at this point. He is mumbling and speaking so softly that I can barely hear or even understand what he is saying, mind you he speaks english. He doesnt tell us there will be a hold on my credit card for the rental, he just swipes. When I ask if there will be one he says $150. This is a LIE. I received an alert on my phone for the charge. I already knew Budget's policy. There is a $200 hold on your card, and since he was an idiot who was also a smarta$$ and chose the wrong reservation I was charged the $200 hold TWICE!!! It was finally time for him to UPSELL everything. He asked if we would like insurance for the vehicle, I said no thank you =) He said, \""Let me finish.\"" He then proceeded to try to scare and threaten us with what could happen. I still declined. I DECLINED EVERYTHING. We finally got the keys and walked away. Total check in time was over an hour. With NO LINE this does not make any sense. Life lesson learned, I WILL NEVER RENT FROM BUDGET AGAIN."
0,"This place is a joke worst service 3 out 4 dinners sent back 2 dinners still wrong the second time, manager doesn't even come back to check ruined our evening and still paid 125 for garbage you want good food go to Parma, this place is over priced over rated and the service and manager dont even care!!!!!!!"
0,"The slices are absolutely huge and there are heapings of oils, sriracha, tobasco and spices to help allay the bland taste. Alas, it does not save this pizza from itself. I rather have a slice from Two Bros or Settebello. The size is a neat gimmick though."
0,Well for my first time here I was way less than impressed. The lady at the front counter was a crab and  the Pierogies really weren't that great. Rather than be kind and answering my questions I settled with the potato and cheese pierogies. I guess Bloomfield Bridge tavern or Mrs. T's is still my go to place. And plus this place is way out of my way to be treated poorly. I wouldn't go back
1,"Best coneys, burgers and salads around! It's like a piece of home for me and my family! We love Dave(the owner) and all of the employees!!!"
1,"We had once again waited until the local restaurants closed for the night while trying to decide what to eat for dinner.  The bf began searching the late delivery website and found this place.  $2 delivery charge.  We expected another random late night junk food take out place meant for people too drunk to know the difference.  It was a pleasant surprise.  I ordered the Gyro and a side of spaghetti for our son.  Bf ordered Philly Cheesesteak and fries and fried zucchini.  The side salad actually came separately in a different bag, not wilted as feared.  They gave us plenty of ranch and blue cheese dressing without extra charge.  The Gyro was pretty good, came on fresh pita bread.  The spaghetti was ok.  The bf enjoyed his food.  The website had saved the address of the last hotel we had food delivered too over a year ago and no one had called to verify so the delivery guy was lost at a different location...he was a good sport about it while the female owner called to blame us for our mistake.  Decent food, and if we decide to order from them again, we will definitely remember to update our address!  For being such a good sport, we gave the guy and extra tip on top of the delivery fee."
1,Had a long day got lazy and didn't feel like making anything called up Lola's for an oyster po boy.  Killer oysters great tarter actually had to take a couple oysters off because I couldn't get them in the crispy bread.  Now Im thinking of going back because Im still thinking of the sandwich the next morning.
1,"My first visit here, and it did not disappoint. Food was good and had fair portions. Staff was friendly and informed us about Happy Hour specials- $3 cheese crisps (amazing!) and $4 Matta's Margaritas. \n\nInterior is beautiful and clean. Displayed at the front door is their March 2014 county health inspection grade: A. Dining area is spacious and inviting. Cantina is a fun area with sports on the TVs. \n\nMy party ordered a diverse selection off the menu, and each item was great! Will definitely be coming back. \n\nSince Top Shelf on Southern closed, this is the next best thing- maybe better."
0,"My mom had the chicken souvlaki platter, I had the pork. In both cases, the meat was quite overdone -- better than underdone, but extremely dried out and I could taste the charred fat.  The potatoes and rice were okay, but nothing special. The salad was pretty pathetic: it looked like sandwich lettuce with some store-bought vinaigrette slathered on top. The only other vegetable in it was carrots; no onions, no peppers, no tomatoes, no feta. Just lettuce and a few carrots -- not exactly a first class Greek salad.\n\nThe service was adequate but they seemed to be in a rush to get rid of us, despite the restaurant only being half full. The ambiance was nothing to write home about -- despite the relative emptiness of the place, they chose to seat us right between two noisy large groups of customers. In retrospect we should have asked to be seated farther away, but really, what were they thinking?\n\nThe most insulting thing was that they charged us $4.95 for tzatziki that should've come with each of the ~$15 souvlaki platters.\n\nOverall this place was not cheap and the food did not live up to the price tag. I've had better souvlaki at chain restaurants like Nickels. I'll never be going back and would suggest you try another Greek restaurant, maybe one of the ones on Parc a few blocks away."
1,One of my favorite pizza places.  The location is understated as it is in a strip mall but it is not a reflection of the quality of food or atmosphere inside.  Great wood fired pizza and wine list.  Its a great place for a casual dinner with family or friends.
0,"You know all the jokes about bad British food?\n\nThe Cornish Pasty is a place that does pasties, which are basically dough pockets filled with various savory fillings. Apparently British miners found these to be ideal vehicles for meals, and they got popular. This place specializes in them, albeit for a price much higher than what a miner could afford. \n\nThe location itself is okay. There is bench seating at large, often shared tables. There was no obvious place to enter, lending to confusion early on. I felt like I had to hunt down a waitress. \n\nThe food was boring. The pasty I had - bangers and mash - was piping hot but about as exciting as cafeteria food. The execution was unquestionably good, but I felt like I was simply wading through a sea of okay chopped meat and boring mashed potatoes. The seasoning could have been improved a lot.  Those eating with me had marginally burned pasties, though their filling was slightly better. \n\nDon't get me wrong - this place isn't bad. It just certainly wasn't for me."
0,"This is my saddest one star rated review ever only because the food could have actually been very good since everything was nicely flavored but what I received I find UNFORGIVABLE.\n\nWe started with a cheese plate and the first thing I noticed was the cheese all appeared to be cut far in advance from our ordering. The Tallegio cheese was also unlike any Tallegio cheese I've ever tried with a much milder taste and firm texture, disappointing but the real problem was THIS CHEESE WAS NOT CUT FRESH TO ORDER.\n\nI went with the seafood special and it was so dry it was as if it was a left over that was over cooked again and it was a filet of fish that was cut in half resulting in an approximate three oz. portion for $29. I do note the sauce my fish was in was very good and the vegetables of carrots and matchstick asparagus were good BUT MY POTATOES were shriveled up and over cooked and when you cut them BROWN rings were threw them like old reheated over cooked potatoes. THREE OZ. OF DRY OVER COOKED (possibly multiple times) FISH with OLD SHRIVELED BROWN potatoes. I've reheated fish at home and it is never as good as fresh made but NEVER WAS IT CLOSE TO THIS DRY and I note the potatoes are not acceptable either.\n\nMy husband's pork shank was WORSE and was an unhealthy ICE COLD in the middle. The heirloom bean ragout seemed like canned garbanzo beans with some lentils and DIDN'T SEEM like a Heirloom bean ragout. I do note the sauce the beans were in was well made.\n\nOur waiter did check on us and I told him about the dry fish and my husband told him about the Ice cold center of the shank. Our waiter did offer to reheat the pork shank but my husband he declined as he felt it would have taken so long it would have ruined the meal even more so.\n\nWhen we received the bill, $12 was removed from the cost of my husband's pork shank. I was surprised no-one from management said a word to us. Our waiter also forgot to give us a bread basket but that wasn't a big deal but have to add that because I am upset over the food they felt is OK to serve.\n\nI don't know if they are like this all the time or not but for sure I'd NEVER go back."
1,"I'm an Apple girl. But, when my dad got his first smart phone EVER last month we received a white glove experience.\n\nFrom start to finish this little pop up shop near Urban Outfitters showcased patience with my dad. I was appreciative of the time, care and attention to detail they displayed. Sometimes buying a technology product can be a humbling experience but the Microsoft Store was gracious in a way that would make me leave a 5 star review."
0,"SLOW SERVICE....the food was gross, chicks(waitresses) weren't hot and a bit rude also, maybe it was a bad night, but I been to the one in san diego and that was a WAYYYY better experience, food wasn't great there either but at least the waitresses were hot looking and they were very attentive and courteous."
0,"Oh, Lakeside, what happened?\n\nThis used to be my absolute favorite yarn shop in Madison. Then they got bought by the people who run The Knitting Tree (which was my least favorite as they were always rude and unhelpful). I recently visited Wisconsin to see my family and was super excited to get into Lakeside as I didn't have the chance at Christmas. \n\nI was so so so sad.\n\nThe wall o'Cascade 220 is gone. ANY yarn in the coffeeshop room is gone. And what yarn was there was so sparingly spread out across the shop that it was just pathetic. The remodel job opens the space up a bit, but with an open space, it's even more obvious that the stock is so sadly low and it's nothing at all like the Lakeside of old. I miss sitting with my cheese sandwich and staring at the Cascade wall, plotting new projects. \n\nNo one greeted me. No one asked if they could help. And when I headed for the door (after a few minutes of searching to see if the things I used to know I could get there still existed), no one even blinked to see if they could be of help.\n\nIt's just pathetic now."
0,"I think this restaurant is overpriced and the food I had was ok.\nI ordered the Ceviche de pescado and Anticucho. The ceviche is big enough to share and they should probably have a smaller (less expensive) version on the menu. The meat portion of the Anticucho was just right, but the salad was not really necessary.\n\nThe flavours on the Ceviche were pretty good. It was well cooked, and the corn was really good. The leche de tigre was flavourful too. \n\nI was a little dissapointed with the Anticucho and expected a stronger marinade flavour.\n\nI also had the Chicha Morada which tasted like it was made with Maiz Morado, but was too watered down and was missing some of the fruit flavours that come along with Chicha. I noticed they don't sell Inca-Kola by the can, just bottle.\n\nThe chips and cancha on the table instead of bread was really nice.\n\nThis is a nice restaurant but way overpriced for the food it serves. If they can get the portion sizes and prices down it'd be a good value. As is now, $50 for 1 person to have an appetizer and a main course is just too much."
1,"Oooh I love the garlic knots! This place introduced me to them and I'm hooked! And so cheap for a big portion! I've only had their calzones, because you get a huge meal for a decent price! They're so good! All the stuffing and melted cheese - mmmmm. Only thing I had an issue with is how they run things during lunch. Why can't they have a server just like for dinner? Very confusing and quite silly."
0,Ate here twice post partying. Pizza is terrible. People only like it because they're all drunk. I prefer that noodle place in the Venetian instead for preventative hangovers.\nPizza cheese was runny and parts of the pizza dough wasn't cooked. And it's not all secret. Everyone knows about this place. Lines are long.
1,Always fabulous! It doesn't matter what sort of crazy long line there is outside this place (And there almost always is one late into the night) it loves quickly and the staff is pleasant and efficient! \n\nEverything I've tried is great and they serve realistic portions.
1,"I know JUST what you're thinking!\n\nYou: \""Is this not Biff Tannen's Pleasure Paradise Casino and Hotel from the alternate 1985 timeline featured in the hit film Back to the Future 2?\""\n\nMe: \""Yes! Good eye!\""\n\nThis once classy, then shabby, then decently renovated hotel served as the exterior for that wonderful movie, which makes it the perfect destination for both film fanatics AND fans of hypothetical alternate-dystopian-timelines set in the 1980's.\n\nThey say that some nights, when the wind blows just the right way, you can almost hear the actor who played Biff asking you for change from the shadows. That's no illusion! Actor Tom Wilson can often be found lurking just outside the casino."

1,"I'm reviewing the D Hotel mainly because of its customer service at the front desk and at reservations. I booked a room two hours before I arrived there as required by an event I thought I was applying for. Turns out, it was something more of a scam. I won't get into the details of it, but after speaking with the manager of reservations, Mary Anne, about my situation and asking to cancel the room though it was against the 48 hour cancellation, she refunded my deposit money and my credit card was not charged. It saved me from losing out on $50 if I wasn't even going to end up staying there, and saved me from a huge headache. My experience with the sketchiness of the \""event\"" didn't sting quite as much because the D hotel gave me one less thing to worry and stress about. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful throughout the whole ordeal, and I would definitely consider staying there next time because of this."
0,"Called about getting my shirts pressed only, the girl on the phone was not helpful and hung up on me before I was finished. $3.95-$4.50 to just press my shirts? That's insane!! I'll def keep calling around."
1,"I have always heard about Herbs and Rye. From co workers and locals alike, so I ventured out for a first..\n\nWe arrived about midnight. As we entered it was dim and very relaxing. We were greeted by Joshua, a very welcoming young man, eager to give us a great experience. We started out with the Beef Carpaccio (w/ aoli, balsamic, caper berries, and wild rocket arugula). It had to be one of the best carpaccios I've had in a while. The dish presented tasted very fresh, and had a great presentation. The carpaccio was smooth and delicate. Not too \""beefy\"". the other key factors was the aoli and balsamic, making this dish enjoyable as well as flavorful. The capers helped balance out the arugula. All in all it got our appetite ready for the main course, and most certainly our taste buds were amused.  My date and I had a \""Martinez\"" cocktail to start. It complimented it well as it made us feel like we were in the 'Good Ol' Days' of Vegas once again. Our server recommended this for us, and we were glad he did so.\n\nFor our entree my date had the Kansas City steak (bone in) cooked medium. I had the ribeye (medium rare). For sides we both had garlic whipped mashed potatoes, the 'infamous' truffle mac n' cheese, and the garlicky spinach. When our entrees were delivered, once again presentation was extraordinary. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and the sides were mouthwatering. The garlic whipped mashed potatoes weren't as \""plain\"" as you ordinary mashed potato dish. They had a subtle character to them. The truffle mac n' cheese was everything we had heard about and then some. Made the entire meal even more enjoyable. Then there was our garlicky spinach. it was nothing like we expected. The spinach was vibrant, full of life. Not mushy and 'can like'.  Would definitely recommend for tourists and locals. Will be here again soon."
1,"I was brought here by two friends who live in Illinois, though not exactly in Chicago proper, who have been gushing about how good Luke's of Chicago's iIalian beef sandwiches for YEARS!  Now ever city has something it's known for: Boston has its baked beans, New York has its pizza, Hawaii has anything with pineapple or coconut on it, and Philadelphia has its cheesesteak sandwich.  Chicago has been lucky enough to have two specialty food items it's well known for - pizza and italian beef sandwiches - which must be why they were generous enough to share one of them with the Scottsdale/Phoenix area. According to my friends,  Luke's of Chicago was a family owned chain back in Chicago and one of the family members moved out to the Phoenix and that's why this one exists.  \n\nNow, I'm writing this review from (Davis) Illinois, but that certainly doesn't make me an authority on what makes for the best Italian beef sandwiches having very little basis for comparison.  What I DO know is that the sandwich I was served last Monday at this particular location of Luke's of Chicago - an Italian beef sandwich, baptized (dunked or doused in warm meet juices) and layered with sweet peppers and cheese was PRETTY FREAKIN' AMAZING.  I'm serious, this was a freakishly good sandwich, worth doing a little extra driving for.  My friends assure me that this is the best Italian sandwich I'll ever taste, and I may do a little comparison shopping while I'm in Illinois to figure out if that is indeed true or not.\n\nWe also ordered some regular french fries and garlic parmesan fries to share and I admit I am also a fan. It was 114 F in Phoenix the day we came here, not a day you'd normally be looking to eat something hot, but that didn't dissuade us since we were on a mission.  I come out to Phoenix once a year from California but this was my first experience at Luke's, my friends went without me last year - still not sure I've forgiven them for that."
0,"BOYCOTT this branch!\nI absolutely despise this in-store 'so called bank' that lacks any customer service skills. Yes I'm here once a day, but if I could find another location that's open after five to drop my deposits I would jump at the chance. I would like to rant about this place, but it's a complete waste of my time.\n\n*** I WILL NO LONGER ever use these buttheads and WILL BE moving my accounts now to another bank. If you walk into this place, go ahead and get your \""SUCKER\"" tattoo to your forehead."
0,"As a Vegas aristocrat with 50+ trips under my belt, I was lured away from Wynn (my usual) by a casino host wanting me to \""re-experience the NEW MGM!\"".  New rooms etc. \""We will blow you away!\""\nWhat I got was the same old tired MGM experience:\n- no limo from the airport (promised) - cabbed it which was fine since it was so close to the airport\n- room type not available upon checkin (6PM) - \""we can switch you over tomorrow\"" - got a smoking room (wanted non) which was nicely newly furnished - but it had the remnants of the previous guest (partly opened gift basket, two empty beer bottles, etc.  Couldn't switch out - host conveniently not available.\n- Freeplay not available / no record\n\nNeedless to say, I got a bad vibe within the first hour and actually moved over to Wynn.  \nI give it two stars because I see the rooms have been upgraded.  \nLots of places to stay in Vegas, but for a primped Wynn Tower Suite / Aria Sky Suite regular - very meh."
0,"Well I took a chance on this place after reading a couple of review.   This place was awful and a rip-off.  I ordered the fried fish plate with cabbage and mashed potatoes and gravy for a total of $10.60 including tax.  \n\nFor starters they only gave me one small piece of what looked like fried tilapia from the frozen section of Walmart.   It was TINY.  For 10 dollars they could at least put two or three pieces of fish in the plate.  I think Shomars nearby has better fish than this and they give you a lot of fish for less.\n\nNow the cabbage was okay but the mashed potatoes were horrible.  They tasted like over-salted boxed mashed potatoes that were old and sitting up all day.  \n\nOverall the food was below expectations and not good at all.  Especially for the price.  They could have added more fish to the plate instead of one small piece of freezer tilapia from the frozen section of Walmart.  \n\nStay away and if you are hungry try going to Shomars, as they have way better food than this horrible place."
1,"Overall, novel combinations of burger ingredients with sushi ingredients that work! Can't wait to explore more of the menu.\n\nThe boyfriend and I recently moved to Charlotte and Cowfish was very high on our list of places to checkout. We love burgers and we really love sushi... So, how could we not love Cowfish?! We hit them for lunch after a day of house hunting. We hit them at an off time (2pm), so there was no wait! It was gorgeous out, so we sat on the patio. Our server, Ellie, was really sweet and attentive. For food, we ordered the What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon Burgushi and the Rainbow Roll lunch combo. I was thoroughly amused and impressed with the What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon. I could see how some people would be put off by the combo, but I loved it! The \""bun\"" utilized soy paper, krab meat (yes...crab with a \""k\"") and sushi rice. A super inventive combo that worked for me! The tuna was seared perfectly to a super rare... I can't stand over cooked tuna! Which paired well with the crisp bacon. The flavor of the ingredients and textures complemented each other well. It was surprisingly entertaining to eat. I deem it crave-worthy! It comes with a side, we opted for sweet potato fries. Some of the best I've ever had! The rainbow roll was solid. Not life changing, but well endowed with fish that was very fresh. Since it was lunch, it came with a side as well. We opted for edamame, which was perfectly steamed and lightly salted. \n\nI really enjoyed Cowfish and I'm looking forward to my next visit!"
0,"Having met the man twice and finding him quite the entertaining character, I decided to try the restaurant inspired by him. Oscar Goodman. The (formerly) happiest mayor on earth. And former mob defense attorney. He and his image are quintessential Vegas. I had to try his steakhouse. \n\nEntering with a coworker at 8 pm on a Monday night, we were seated right away. Service can only be described as short and surly. From the hostess to the two servers we encountered, I consistently got the strong impression they were looking at their watches in anticipation of closing time. A stark contrast to, say, Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse over at Golden Nugget (see separate review). \n\nThe menu is mob-inspired, consisting of names of gangsters you'll recognize. I went with the Spilatro's Steak with garlic mashed potatoes. It may not look like much from the attached photo, bit it was actually quite good. \n\nThe restaurant is adorned with photos of Oscar and his career. I think the theme works fine here, and the location is great. It's in the area formerly occupied by Firefly, directly at the West end of Fremont Street. The dining area over looks the Fremont Street Experience. It's an excellent view. \n\nAll in all, the food was good. The theme was fun. But the service not so much. I'm always deeply disappointed when a place gets so much right and then just drops it all at customer service. How do other places like Vic's get it right consistently and places like this don't? I think it starts at the top. Carefully screening the right personalities to hire and then training and evaluating them. Consistently. \n\nOscar's needs to make an attempt, here. And until they do, the servers will bring down the house. This may be why there was so much open seating at 8 pm during Spring Break week. \n\nI sincerely hope they do bring it around because I'd like to see this place survive. If enough people point this out to them, maybe they will."
0,Food was pretty good but the service was terrible. Server was unprofessional and came back after everyone had paid and asked for a better tip. I've been in the service industry for 8 years and have never ever seen such a thing. Will not be returning.
0,"Cleanliness: It could have used a sweep and wipe when I was in there and it was only moderately busy- no line.\nFood: The selection at this place was not stellar! I really like frozen yogurt, but the flavor selection while good in number was not too appealing in flavor. I also had a repeat of what happened at Mojo with the fast meltdown. I think they need to set the freeze level higher.\nJust not worth the time and money for another stop."
1,"Tryna have a good time ASAP?! 44 Magnum + 2 extra shots.\nYou'll definitely be on a good level while enjoying Vegas.\n\n*warning if yo dont wanna experience flavored vodka i guess sticking with one extra shot will still give you some level.\n\nEh, felt like customer service was whatever. seemed a bit rude serving but its understandable to those who wanna just have fun ."
1,"The Tournament of Kings show is cheesy, over the top and completely entertaining. Our group had a fantastic time. And surprisingly, the food was good too.\n\nWe were seated in Russia's section, second row. The storyline is very interactive with lots of audience participation. All the entertainers seemed really into their character, which was nice to see.\n\nWater and soda are free. A bar menu is also available. \n\nI will upload a pic of the food. The chicken was very moist. It would have been nice to have some sort of sauce to tie the whole dish together (however I do realize that may or may not be compliant with the medieval (sans silverware) theme) so I ended up dipping my broccoli into the tomato soup, which tasted delicious.\n\nI think ToK is a great, entertaining show that is completely different than the other shows on the Strip."
0,"(This review is for Las Vegas ie: The Strip)\n\nWent to Las Vegas on the weekend for a friends 30th B'day celebration.\n\nIt quickly dawned on me that LV is everything I hate about the USA in one location. Mindless gambling drones, drunk red-neck frat boys at 2 in the afternoon, plastic barbies, the excess of it all.\n\nThe one star is for the flight home."
1,Best stir fry in town!
1,"Great place for a large group! Made reservations for a very large group (nearly 30) and needed to have separate checks, and they were very accommodating. The large open area near the bar fit us easily and the tables were set up thoughtfully to allow us to be together in a group but in such a way that it was easy to get up and move around. Food was excellent, and the servers were right on top of things all the way around from getting drinks served to bringing out everyone's food at the same time, and efficiently handling the separate checks without any of the confusion that so often accompanies dining in large groups. Well done!!!"
1,"Wow -- what a change!   I remembered reading Carly's review in my earliest Yelp days (looking for new places around UNLV) and thinking -- nice decor?  huh?  looking at the pictures and scratching my head.  Okay -- the last time I ate at Stephano's -- you know that place across the street from UNLV's Student Union that serves falafel and gyros -- it was always so dumpy and kind of, well, pathetic.  I felt sorry for the guys that ran it -- they tried so hard...  but I never dragged myself back...\n\nFor some reason today I needed a change from my regular banh mi -- and took a friend over to Stephano's -- I couldn't believe my eyes -- WOW!  what a change!  This place looks really terrific now -- it's no longer a dump!  It's really really cute -- Efficient counter service in the front -- with comfortable chairs in the dining area -- even a cozy lounge - I guess for hookah in the back.   \n\nThere's even a Stephano -- or Stephan - the owner - and he was darling, kind and very happy to know that the change was noticed.  \n\nThen there's the food -- I went in with my tastebuds set on falafel -- that's Amena Bakery's fault but they were too far away -- the real truth behind why I actually went to Stephano's!  But I got inside and was so blown away -- I noticed the Gyro Bowl right away -- why?  because it included cleverly, their yummy buttery rice, Israeli salad, tzatsiki and gyro meat -- hmmm.... perfect -- particularly with a big squeeze of fresh lemon juice!  It was huge -- My friend got one too and we split an order of fries (because Carly said they were not to be missed -- and she wasn't joking -- they're fab).  They had pickled turnip at the counter -- and red rooster to kick things up.  I was stunned by their beer selection -- but Stephano was quick to let us know that come April 1st, their full liquor license will be in effect so we should expect a lot more from him soon!\n\nAgain -- a perfect Yelp find!   And only because of Carly's brilliant review did I even venture back inside again -- now it's going to be a regular part of my UNLV lunchtime repertoire!    \n\nCongratulations Stephan!  We'll YELP the word out!\n\nUpdate:  a small group of us gathered pre-Slow Food lecture and tried a vegetarian plate and a meat plate -- both were great.  Nick and Maria, Stephan's nephew and niece who run the restaurant with him couldn't have been more hospitable.  \n\nToday, I ran over to grab a quick bite for lunch -- Nick had mentioned the other evening how good the ribeye was -- so I had the ribeye shawerma.  Ok, it was messy, drippy, and I was so happy I wasn't wearing white because I loved every juicy bite!  I had them replace the standard tomatoes and onion for israeli salad -- and I added a squeeze of lemon= heaven.  And not so huge (about 1/4 less than a Chipotle burrito) that I wanted to take a nap afterwards."
1,"I will review this place in the order in which we experienced it:\n\nFirst we arrived at the establishment to be greeted by the unfriendly hostess who had a nasty little attitude. She asked us what our last name was, in which my fiance replied: \""I will just tell you my first name, because my last name is very long, and hard to pronounce.\"" So he told her his first name, and she preceded to still ask for his last name. My fiance repeated his reason for not giving it to her, to which she replied with a roll of the eyes and a \""Well, it's a 45 minute wait.\"" I think she misunderstood the favor that we were doing her by not having to go through the trouble of spelling, and pronouncing our last name; which she would have butchered if left to her. \n\nAfter that, we went to the bar. I am not a fan at sitting at the bar, but the bartenders were very animated and friendly. They served us our drinks and food quickly. The bartenders were also very helpful on helping us make selections. We ordered (I don't remember the exact names) the pub sliders, pretzel sticks, and the fish and chips. Me and my fiance share food a lot, and it is a wise idea to do that here,because the portions are large. \n\nI thought that the food was presented beautifully, and that it tasted good. The pub sliders were juicy and came with a side of garlic mayo, loved it. The pretzel sticks came with a side of spicy mustard (VERY SPICY AND AWESOME), and the fish and chips were tasty and not too greasy. \n\nWhile we were eating at the bar and enjoying ourselves, we noticed the beauty queen hostesses up front flipping their hair and snapping their gum. We also noticed a ton of empty tables in the establishment. Clearly, doing their job is so exasperating for them. Gosh, they should take a break. \n\nI would come here again, and I would recommend it to a friend. I took off a star because of the rude introduction we got from the hostesses. Ramsay above all people should know that first impressions mean a lot, and that those ladies up front gave us, and from what I'm reading most people, a bad taste in their mouth."
1,"I've been a frequent customer of this establishment for years. I think we go there at least once a month.  Yes its a chain and their t-shirts are hokey but their food is probably some of the best BBQ I have eaten.  My favorite entree is the catfish fingers (which they discontinued *boo*).  There is a selection for any picky eater.  I'm not a big red meat eater so its refreshing to have so many chicken and pork selections.  The side dishes are probably what seals the deal for me.  My favorites are the mac and cheese and wilbur beans.  \n\nThe only misgivings I have are:\n\n#1) The manager needs to stay in the kitchen and not check with every diner how things are going..\n\n#2) I try not to eat in the bar area, they tend to spend more time doing drink orders since it is the bar.\n\nAll in all it is probably in the top 5 of restaurants that I eat at regularly."
0,Run by scumbags.  If you contact a promoter to get on the guestlist the doormen pretend that they don't know who that promoter is.  Huge line outside 1+ hour wait and the club is completely empty.  They are just trying to hype it up and make people want to pay $10 to come here.  That seriously killed everyone's buzz.  Ended up ditching the line and cover charge for NO line and NO cover charge at Axis and had a great time!
0,"I really wanted to like this place. I went for basic Mexican food, guacamole and carne asada tacos. Both were largely under portioned and extremely over priced. To be honest, I don't care too much about price as long as I'm getting quality food. Roberto's taco shops serves better carne asada tacos and I only go there when I'm drunk/hungover! The server was friendly, location is good, and the decor was okay. I do like the rooftop patio but until they get better quality food and lower their prices I won't be back. It's matter of time before this place shuts down. Hopefully next year the new restaurant will have good food!"
1,"I found these guys straight on Yelp. I was driving around and need a quote for some stickers and they came up first on the Yelp app. After hearing their prices on fliers, we also added that to the job which I wasn't even trying to do with them originally. \n\nIf you are searching for a print company and reading this review, just go ahead and call them, they will take care of you. I even messed up my design I sent over, they fixed it on their end but it still ended up getting printed with the mistake. Not a big deal and I still blame myself but they still offered to reprint them for free. There wasn't enough time to get them reprinted so they offed a discount on the next job. \n\nThanks to Yelp for helping me find the perfect print company to work with!"
1,"food is still good , slice of pastami n rye is heaven on earth, with dr brown root beer no y ou didn't jgo for the ambience its those delcious heartstoping sandwhciches..and be patient you mave have wait for a table.. but you can always take out..smile"
1,I enjoy the barbershop atmosphere.  They are unique.  This one is no different.  It has it's own character.  Unfortunately it's a person on his cellphone. Outside of that the conversation is good. We joke around with each other and have to catch up on our day to day each time I go. Now if your pretentious then perhaps you should stick with the chain cutters. That way I don't have to wait for you in line.
0,"I've got to add to the chorus of one and two-star reviews for this place. Another Scottsdale establishment that's faaaaar too pricey and waaaay too full of itself to justify the median price of $11 for margaritas (mine was served in a small, 10 oz. glass, and was mediocre. And don't even get me started on the food menu - which I gladly passed on, though I could have eaten). \n\nThe atmosphere in the daytime is blah to average at best, with a gaggle of servers all congregating and giggling amongst themselves too busily to distract for something called...\""service\"". And, servers? Listen up...never, ever address your valued customers as \""buddy,\"" or 'bud\"". It's plain condescending. That's \""sir\"", or the name on my gold card. And your server's salary is much too jeopardized to be smirking your way through your Tom Cruise in Cocktail trying-to-impress-the-girls-not-the-customers fantasy...okay, bud? That's why you got a 12% tip tonight. Oooooh, I know it hurts, but you need to shape up and read a book called \""Customer Service for Beginners\"", grow up and step into the real world, bud.\n\nAlternative to night out at Douche Factory: grab some Fresh and Easy tortilla chips and awesome restaurant-style salsa, a sixer of Corona, some fajita fixins and a friend, and settle in for an actually ENJOYABLE evening - all for about a fifth of the cost (or less) of this sorry-ass place."
1,"Seen all the bad reviews. So i was worried. But i was already in the same area and hungry. And It wasnt bad at all! Wasnt packed out but it was busy, and they were fast to get my rolls out. Good place to get your fix."
1,"Delicious! Really excellent curries,  with a good number of selections. I'd suggest keeping your spice level below a 7. I normally like spicy food,  and the 7 was just at the edge of my tolerance!"
1,"Just had lunch here and I must disagree with a lot of the reviews. \n\nService was spot-on. Waitress was great and very attentive. Refills for drinks constantly. \n\nLove the decor, environment, the total vibe. I feel really bad that so many people reviewed based on a brand new establishment and not giving them credit for just opening. \n\nFood was good: the bbq pork sliders with kimchi was tender and juicy. The chicken apple and brie sandwich was bomb. Such a unique flavor. \n\nWill definitely be coming back."
1,"While on Montreal for business for a few days and staying in the old town, I have bumped into this traditional polish restaurant for a casual dinner.\n\nThis is an old school classic eastern european restaurant that has lots of tradition and less novelty. \n\nThe food now, what can I say? good borsh (sour beet soup), really good pierogi (which is the polish equivalent for ravioli), an excellent polish sausage and some mighty fine polish and Lithuanian beer were sampled.\n\nbottom line: everything was good and service was great!\n\nThe atmosphere is very warm, the owners and the people who work there all speak polish, French and English. the place is very warm and features live piano on evenings."
0,Went for a 1 hour massage.  After massage was done I got dressed drank a glass of water paid for mine and my brothers massage and walk out the door.  When I walked out the door I looked at the time on my phone and it had only been 50min.  Let the girl at the front desk know and they acted like I was crazy.  I have no need to lie about the length of my massage.  I get massages once a week and have never checked the time until now.
0,"Big portions. Decent price. Taste is okay.\n\nThe happy hour is a rip off, however. It's very little and doesn't taste wonderful."
1,"Always had good, fresh food and friendly service. Their chicken tacos are some of the best I have ever had, and I will always be a customer because one time I ordered but had lost my debit card, and they still fed me and just told  me to come back the next day and pay. There are not many resteraunts or businesses that will do that anymore, and I was impressed.\n\nThey also make a pretty good torta and the carne asada is pretty good. \n\nCheap, fast, and yummy...."
0,"No beef ribs? Forget it, this ain't a Q place.\n\nWhere are the guys chopping hickory? How do they actually smoke anything?\n\n$$$ to high for a hole in the wall prefab Q place.\n\n(Sort of an update) My wife said the above was unfair if I had not even tried the food so she brought me some to make an informed opinion. So here it is:\n\nThe brisket was dry and the smoke taste was I think injected, I could not locate a smoke ring. The ribs were drown in sauce and for good reason, the hog was overcooked, sad. The sides were nothing to cheer about, I have had better beans and slaw from Walmart, and that is truly sad. \n\nThe original single star is exactly the same after eating the food. I may have made some assumptions based on what i saw when I walked in the first time, but I seem to have been right. Still looking for great Q in Vegas. (There is good Q, but still looking for great Q.)"
1,Ziggy was awesome.  Ziggy's is awesome
1,Thomas and his awesome machine cleaned our carpets like nobody else has been able to.  He took the time to come in and move furniture and ensure all of it was moved back.  He is professional and have great prices.  We highly recommend him.
1,"Le Sainte Elisabeth is known for its legendary terrace. It's not as grand as the crazy one over at Saint-Sulpice, but its size and in-the-corner-ness does give it quite the kick.\n\nThe inside is pretty nice, and it's got that nice woody bar feeling you expect to see in a proper pub. If the first floor is full (and chances are it will be), there's also a pretty big second floor with much more space. The music at the place is pretty loud though, so you'll have to get pretty up-close-and-personal if you want to talk to someone.\n\nThey turned their fireplace on (with FIRE!) when I was there in the winter, and that was a pretty good spot to hang around until the staff forced us out cause we were blocking the entrance. Oh also, just a heads up, the terrace is closed in the winter. \n\nThe entrance to the bar is in a small, fully graffiti'd alleyway off of St Catherine street. It's hard to miss the entrance on a night out since there's usually a crowd outside and the graffiti on the wall outside is pretty neat."
1,"While we did not dine this time, we ordered cocktails and checked the place out. \n\nThe staff was very friendly, passionate and knowledgeable about their menu. The decor is casual, fun and inviting. I really loved the Italian bar stools made of medel and branded in various automotive brands. The bleachers hanging from the ceiling is pretty kitchie too.\n\nI did find the pricing to be a bit high, however not having tasted the food, as yet, I will reserve my comment.\n\nThere is nothing better than walking into an establishment where the staff is happy to be there and it shines through from the moment they greet and seat you, until you say goodbye.\n\nI will definitely be back."
1,"3.5 really - but I'll round up 'cause I'd like them to do well.\n\nHere's the deal. \nI had three small plates and a cocktail. \n\nThe cocktail (Sake Long Time) was light and refreshing, and the little lychee balls that popped in my mouth were tasty and fun. It's been so long since anything has popped in my mouth... \n\nbut I digress...\n\nTwo of the small plates (a nightly special - Blue Crab Spring Roll, and the Asian Crepes) were quite good. The dishes were well-prepared and tasty.\n\nThe third plate - the Chicken Pretzel Brat - was pretty standard. Just okay.\n\nAll together, the meal cost about $40 with tip.\n\nAnd there's my issue. For $40, I felt like I was on the low end of \""enough\"".\nYes, I appreciate the fresh ingredients, as well as the inventive preparation - but when I can get good All-You-Can-Eat sushi nearby for $30 total; ...well, I'm more likely to go for that. \n\nI'm not a quantity-over-quality guy, and I don't need to gorge to be happy - but the balance needs to be a bit more in favor of portion size before I can justify being a regular at Nosh & Swig. \n\nGlad I tried it. Hope they do well at this location."
0,"We purchased a high end mattress that was delivered on May 30, 2011. It has become very uncomfortable to sleep on it and the concern to make it right is non-existent at this point. They have received a report from Integrated Bedding Group but so far have failed to acknowledge that report. One of their reps told me that just because it was uncomfortable didn't mean it was defective. They tell you to shop local so you would think they would care about satisfying a customer. Never again will I shop there!"
1,I had seen this restaurant in La Jolla for years but never made it in. I was excited to see one in Scottsdale Quarter so I could finally try it. \nIt is really good food but some rooms are better to be seated in and the service can be really slow. \nAnother plus is it is 1000 points on Open Table.
1,"Dim Sum on this Sunday morning in Montreal turned out to be a real treat.  Open earlier than other places (9:00 AM), Ruby Rouge was already packed at 10:00 AM when we arrived.  With patience and persistence, we left full to the gills with delicious treats.  \n\nCarts are only part of the story here.  You can also order from the buffet and from the kitchen.  My favorite:  the sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves.  Truly wonderful!  My only regret is having only my one stomach to fill.  Oh, if only Gluttony weren't one of the Seven Deadly Sins!"
0,"****restaurant review only****\n\ni used to love la sala rossa. just went this week end with 2 other friends and service was awful. none of us got our food together, the waitress forgot to order some of our appetizer and potatoes, then blamed it on the kitchen (NO-NO!!!) waited for the end of the meal to ask us if we wanted anything else to drink, and a couple of days later, 2 of us realized they completely overcharged our cards! this is a definite \""never-ever\"" no matter how cool the place used to be. a disaster of a dinner."
1,"I worked here for a short time three years back and just simply fell I'm love with everything about it. The playing music from the,40s,50s, very much like the Frank Sinatra era. It always reminds me of a back east eatery except they have a wonderful outdoor patio life. They have wonderful flavored salad that are gigantic they could feed probably three hungry girls! They have a very large wine list, and a full bar. You can also place reservation for large parties. I would even recommend that you place a reservations if it's Thursday Friday or Saturday because the wait can be very long if you just show up. They do serve a Chicago style pie pizza, which is to die for! They do slices of pizza if you're trying to eat light or cheap during the lunch hour. And everything is literally made fresh, with very high quality.  The only thing that ever makes me sad here is that the ladies restroom only has one stall..... Other than that there is absolutely nothing to complain about!  the price point is right, the locations are great, the atmosphere is welcoming, and it doesn't matter if it's just you or a party of 30 it is a great choice for dining out as well as pick up!"
1,"The grilled chicken salad I had was really good. Very fresh tasty and plentiful. The little tortilla strips gave my bites a nice crunch and the little tomatoes were yummy. Our waitress was extremely cool and nice. So yay for her! :D We came in after the restaurant was supposed to be closed, but they were still letting some people in. My friend really liked the half BBQ chicken. It was tender and moist. Came with a side of coleslaw and french fries. We pretty much cleaned up our plates."
1,"Hello, I got into a car accident this past summer and Dr. Mike and his crew really helped me out a lot. I was referred to them by some friends and I was surprised at the rehab they do along with the awesome Chiropratic work. All the doctors and staff know what they are doing. The office is always clean and a really nice place. Try them you will be happy, I was."
0,"We started going to the \""BIRD\"" as we call it starting the second week that it first opened. As time went on they just kept getting better and better. We would go sometimes 2-4 time a week. Then they changed owners, but wanting to give the new owners a chance we went a few more times. In our opinion it went down the flusher. They starting changing certain items trying to go on the cheap. Too bad. Why people buy a successful business then change things I don't know. The killer for us was on our 4th retry the bacon was no longer nice full pieces, they were shriveled up tiny pieces that would fit inside a teaspoon spoon. We said that's enough. Too bad. Several other friends that we had recommended to go there in the beginning has also quit going due to their changes. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME !!!\nDON, VICKIE, & ANDREW"
1,"Dined with a large group on a Saturday evening. We had a variety of steaks all were cooked perfectly and delicious, best in Vegas. The calamari app was the best we've ever had, perfect. My only complaint was the dessert. Two in our group got the ice cream trio, not only was it partially melted very small scoops but there were no \""fresh baked cookies\""  served with it like the menu stated. Disappointing dessert for an otherwise delicious meal."
1,"Visiting NC from AZ and was very disappointed in food - until I tried Nana's!  I had a small plate of smothered fried chicken,great Mac n cheese, yams.  All was flavorful and homecooked. I am on my way to the airport stuffed. Glad I tried one more place. :)"
1,"Very informative and cool tour!!  Char, our guide, was awesome!! Got some interesting ideas for our remodel!!"
1,I can and do spend hours here.  Between the dancing waters and the flowers there is no better way to pass the time.  Best part is it's so romantic and tranquil and its free !!!!!!
1,"A coworker and I ventured over to the new diner for lunch today. Instead of the standard lunch time fare, we both chose to go with breakfast for lunch, and we were both glad with our decision. The outrageous breakfast sandwich is just that, outrageously good. The toasted Mancini's bread with a fluffy egg, cheese and your choice of meat hit the spot. I went with bacon, and was rewarded with a delightful marriage of bacon, egg and cheese. I also got a side of shredded potatoes as they are called on the menu, and requested they be covered in cheese. Overall a great lunch. Will certainly be back for more delicious affairs of food."
0,"I've only been here twice. The first time I wanted to try it because I had seen the long lines out front on the weekends, and the second time because I thought the first was a fluke. \n\nBoth times the food was decent--standard breakfast fare with little flair. It was good, don't get me wrong, but didn't seem to justify the long wait.\n\nWhat was surprising about this place is that the first time I went there the server tried to tell me what to order. I was told that \""complicated\"" items take too long and I would be better off getting standard items like eggs or pancakes. I understand that they want to turn over tables quickly with the long wait, but pushing people off of menu items is a big turn-off for me.\n\nThe second time I went they were out of the item I wanted. I will try to get back there during the week when it's not as busy and see if my experience is better."
0,This is consistently the most unorganized Einsteins we go to. We try to avoid this location but when we find ourselves here our hopes are that they've improved. Year after year we've found they they stay consistent: unorganized and confused.
1,"I thought this place was awesome, especially for the room rates that my friend and I paid. Super budget-friendly, with plenty of amenities that were unexpected but totally a nice surprise. \n\nI had only expected the very basics, like a simple bed and the bathroom area. We also had an in-room refrigerator, even a stove top we could have used to cook if we wanted, and microwave. The room was pretty spacious!\n\nThe hotel staff were helpful and nice. I like that the hotel was pretty quiet. The look of this Red Roof Inn and the landscaping also made me feel like I had just entered the suburbs, somewhere on the East Coast. It totally feels like home!"
1,"If you aren't in a rush to catch a plane, this is a decent Mexican food place to catch food at. Just be prepared to search high and low for a table. And when you do happen to get a spot, order asap as your waitress comes. Took 10 to even get one, another 20 to order and then about 15-20 for the food. I had a taco salad with chicken that was really good for airport food. Dark red salsa is extremely spicy! All the waitresses were working their butts off so make sure not to complain and just be patient."
0,"1) The food wasn't that good. Usually Vietnamese food is pretty reliable, but this just didn't taste right. The soup was too oily, and the meat was seriously lacking. \n\n2) The menu options are very limited, and a little odd. I asked if the seafood noodle dish had an option to get chicken instead (very normal for most Vietnamese restaurants), and he said no. Then he said, \""so you don't want the pork heart in it?\"" It didn't sound like a joke. He did end up putting two slices of chicken in as a favor, but that was just strange. \n\n3) The owners were babysitting their kid or a family friend's child... they lifted up the child so the kid could stand on the counter and play with the stuff that was higher up. This is the counter for food and she was stepping all over it with her shoes after walking all around the filthy floor. Not okay."
1,"Most Americans think Italian food is what you get at some chain restaurant.  Let me help you, nothing you get at a chain restaurant remotely approximates Italian food..  Having said that, La Calabria comes pretty dog gone close.\n\nI've eaten here several tomes not and everything has been outstanding.  Actually, let me step back from that for a second...the salad that comes with the meal is a salad.  Not spectacular not bad, just a salad.  But what do you expect from lettuce?\n\nA few other observations....\n\n- its a store front restaurant.  Personally I don't care about things like that.  I learned a long time ago, you can't eat ambiance.\n\n- I believe they bring the bread in.  Some days it's good other days it's good but a bit stale.\n\nNotwithstanding anything even remotely negative here, the food still remains outstanding and at the end of the day, it's always about the food."
0,"Went over to Arpa for dinner last night. I have had tapas before, and although the plates are small, they usually pack a nice flavor and you leave feeling not stuffed, but satisfied. The food was not bad, but we left feeling pretty hungry still. To start we ordered the goat cheese balls in the truffle honey, which were very good, but there were literally only 2 and they were sooooo small! Definitely felt ripped off here. We also ordered the roasted eggplant dip with pita and that was pretty good. We then ordered the salmon, sea bass and a side of asparagus, heeding the waitresses warning about how small the servings were. We couldn't really taste the asparagus because they were pretty burnt, and the salmon came out pretty raw (I ordered it medium). The seabass seemed okay. I would probably go back here for drinks because the bar area looked pretty cool, and in the outside area where we ate they had couches and it was a cool lounge area. I liked the decor and general feel of the place and our server was super friendly and attentive. But I definitely would not order the sangria again, tasted kind of funky and lacked flavor, and the strawberry inside looked kind of scary."
1,"I decided to try Menchie's out tonight. It was definitely a lil busy and the interior looks cool. I liked the fact that Menchie's have sorbets. I personally didn't try them, because I didn't want to hold up the line. However, for those that are allergic to dairy, its definitely a great alternative.The waffle bowls looked awesome, but I was too full to get one. The only flavor that I tried was the vanilla which I did not care for much. It tasted too artificial, but I liked the fact that they had a lot of toppings to choose from. I think next time I go, I will definitely make it a point to try other flavors. Another positive thing is that Menchie's has a frequent buyer card. Incentive for people like me to go back and get the 10th one free. Unfortunately, I think that Menchie's is a lil more pricier than Yogels or Yogurtland, but I think its worth the try."
0,Not a 4 star hotel as described on Hotwire.  Smelled terrible. The staff was lost when it came to reservations.  The cleanliness was not to speak of.  \n\nI will not ever step foot in this hotel again.  Save yourself the struggle and book somewhere else.
0,"Very romantic restaurant.\n\nFood and service is really just FAIR and mediocre, not Provence authentic at all (YES I've been to Provence 4 times).\nPasta is not fresh, nor is it that tasty.\n\nAnother Disney like theme restaurant in Paris Paris hotel... find a better Italian off the strip as I found 1 thats run by Sicilian family 5 miles away frequented by locals.\n\nThey get you in and out without much pizzaz.\nWham bam thank you madam, now get out."
1,"Must go! Love this place! Great food! Amazing atmosphere.\n\nThis place is hip, fun and a cool urban spot everyone must check out in MTL.\nFood is great. A lot of their food is Cooked on a charcoal grill and has amazing, full flavors. Its tapas style so you can order a lot of smaller dishes and taste test a bunch of different things!\nIts asian fusion so you would have to like those kind of flavors to enjoy the food to its fullest.\n\nGreat urban decor, and this place has an upbeat, party kind of vibe. Great for birthday groups, but maybe not so much for a first date. It is VERY loud, some people might find it bothersome. But if you are lame and don't like to have a good time when you go out, stay home and order in, this place won't be for you. Going in a group is best. Or as a couple if you are down to have a couple drinks and let loose. Service is a bit slow sometimes, it is always at full capacity with reservations and walk ins. I suggest Strongly to make a reservation.\nThey have a private party room that fits up to 30 people you can reserve if you are a huge group, there is a MASSIVE TV in their so you can watch the game if you wanted. (only tv in the restaurant is in the private room)\n\nAll in all, I give Imadake 5 stars because I believe it's a MUST check out spot that I would guarantee people enjoy. Foods good (3.5-4 stars), fair prices, fun atmosphere!\n\nCheers"
1,Food is always great and service is good! Best brunch in Charlotte. My son loves the beignets and they sell out quick...
0,"Disappointed in the selection here. I'm a big fan of J. Crew and usually walk out with something, but the variety was truly lacking here. An associate greeted me on the way in, but unfortunately, not much left to rummage thru. \n\nWalked out empty-handed."
1,"Yum!  We had the Prosciutto pizza here and it was delicious.  Our waiter was very friendly (and attractive).  The price for a medium-sized pizza was pretty good ($13-18) and we had plenty to eat.  The prices for wine were decent as well.  This is a nice place to go for a gourmet pizza and get a lot of bang for your buck.  Also, it is decorated very funky and cool, which is fitting for the Village/Latin Quarter area of Montreal."
0,"If I could give negative starts I would.  Actually, if I could burn down this excuse for a place to eat I would happily do that as well. \n\nTrust me, I am not one that expects a phenomenal dining experience at a Las Vegas 24/7 diner..but standards are still standards.  Dude, I love me some Norm's so really I am not the pickiest of people. \n\nWalked into this place late night after a little fun (not for me but for the casino who emptied my checking account).  Seated quickly which was nice and then the nightmare began.  My friend and I ordered a burger, breakfast plate, couple of cocktails and at the recommendation of our server, a margarita pizza.   \n\n20 minutes in...still no cocktails.  45 minutes in...no food.  What the hell.  Food was bland, tasteless but at least there was a lot of ketchup at the table.  Hmmmm...no pizza though.  Didn't say anything just assumed he forgot.  After we finish, I hold up my card and no check arrives for at least another 45 minutes.  Now I'm really pissed.  Finally the server comes takes my card with NO CHECK and comes back with it run.  \nOf course, as suspected the pizza is still on the check.  Server then takes another 20 minutes to come back so I can tell him.  He says he will get the manager. 30 minutes later...no manager.  \nNever in my life have I stiffed anybody but there is always a first.  I tracked him down and told him to get the stupid pizza comped off and boom there was his tip.  I tracked down the manager and told him he was a FU*$@#g piece.  3 hours and $90 wasted on an experience matched by my last rectal exam."
1,"The staff is friendly, fast and efficient.  The food is fresh and made to order.  They often run specials sent via text so join the CAPS104."
1,"Da ich schon seit einer Weile versuche, so viel wie m\u00f6glich vegan zu leben, war ein Besuch bei Kai's Pizza ein Muss. Denn s\u00e4mtliche Gerichte werden hier auf Wunsch mit Wilmersburger serviert. F\u00fcr 1EUR mehr gibt's sogar nen Teig aus Dinkel- oder Vollkorn statt Weizenmehl. Kurz zur Pizza: Geschmacklich toll, lecker knusprig und ausgezeichnet gew\u00fcrzt. Auch f\u00fcr nicht-Veganer eine echte Empfehlung!"
1,"Great food, great drink. I had the crab enchiladas (very good) and a Margarita Flight (1 Patron, 1 Passion Fruit and 1 I do not remember). This place never disappoints."
0,"I have tried this place twice now...\nMy mistake.\n\nI went this past Sunday for a pedi/mani.\nThe place, like some, needs a definite facelift, and I'm not sure how 'sanitary' things are.\nBut, as the tech was trimming up my cuticles, she took a huge chunk off the site of my cuticle/skin area on the side of my big toe.  I said 'ouch' cuz it did shock me a bit...and she proceeded with the pedicure.\nShe poured alcohol on it...OUCH....and continued to put the super strong callice remover in the same area...DOUBLE OUCH!  I was almost in tears it burned so bad.\nI nicely asked if she could poor some water over it to stop the burning...and she didn't understand what I was saying.  She didn't even put superglue over it to cover the 'raw' piece.\n\nI decided against getting a manicure after that, only because I wasn't feeling 'it' after that and when I went to pay via debit card...she tells me that I can only tip in cash.  (this is new from the last time I was there 2 months ago).  I explained I only had a $20 and could she give me $14 back?\nShe said no, and stuck my $20 in her drawer and proceeded to answer her cell phone and ignore me.\n\nUmmmm...ok...\n\nIt is now Wednesday and the skin on the side of my big toe is pussing and still bleeding.  DISGUSTING...and quite painful to try and walk around at work in heels all day.\n\nDO NOT go to this salon.\nSave yourself the trouble and money and go anywhere else in this area."
0,"Beware! This business does not honor any of the yelp deals listed! I purchased the $100 voucher for $75 and when I went to use it, the tailors there had no idea what it was, and said that the owner had never mentioned anything to them about it.  They also do not honor the 10% off check ins unless your alteration is over $100... Which is not notated as a requirement on the deal at all.  This horribly run business is misusing social media marketing, I am awaiting my refund from yelp and taking my business elsewhere."
1,"This just in: Houstons is on steroids! Yup, it's true. \n\nIf you're familiar with Houston's you're familiar with Hillstone. But, Hillstone is better in my opinion. Why? \n\n-Wonderful outside \""first come first served\"" patio seating with fireplaces \n-Indoor/Outdoor space for the bar area \n-A sushi bar (and shockingly really good sushi. We had the mango salmon roll - delicious). \n-No need to worry about Valet... lots of parking. \n-Great service.\n\nWhat hasn't changed is the menu and the crowd. Still your 40+ real estate suits - or should I say jeans + a blazer - and all the cougary women that come along with these men... Not knocking it, simply the truth.\n\nOverall, a great place for a good American meal, people watching or to take your parents. This isn't a place you'll be racing to take your friends who just came into town... it's a chain restaurant. There are way too many locally owned gems in the Valley to spend too much time here."
0,The day manager there is extremely rude. He's in his 30s n thinks he's badass for being a manager. \n\nI was waiting in line for a prescription. An older lady 60-70 yrs old had a raincheck for cereal. He begins to degrade her bc she had the store copy of the raincheck. He trained everybody in this store and they wouldn't have given her the copy. I couldn't believe he would think she was trying to pull a scam for 2 boxes of cereal. The lady never said a word. I still regret not saying something about how rude he was. \n\nPharmacy is always slow and when u need an OTC med they ignore you and are rude bc they have to get ur drivers license info.
0,"Checked in on Friday, December 26 - Checked out Monday December 29.. I will never ever stay here again.  Our restroom was gross!!! Mildew all around the tub, the wall was falling apart.... Towels that were there were stained with black and to top it off our bathroom sink was clogged!! No point calling to complain was left on hold forever.  I will never stay at this hotel and I would not recommend to any, you would think for being a hotel right on the strip it would be up to date however NOPE!"
1,"Here's how it works: Meet at a bar. Get a wrist band and a free drink. Hang out for a little. Load up in a mini-bus with other people in your group. Drink in said mini-bus and make friends. Arrive at the first club. Skip the line, don't pay cover. Dance, drink for an hour or two, then at a particular time hosts will tell you it's time to go to the next place. Repeat for two more clubs. As the evening goes on, the different groups consolidate into fewer and fewer buses as people stay at clubs they like or just get tired and leave. By the final club, all the groups are back together again. At the end of the night, find your way home (or ride the bus to a strip club.)\n\nWhy it's good:\n1) Skip the freaking idiotic lines at three pretty darn good clubs.\n2) You get to hang out with the same group of people all evening long... and you're stuck on a freaking bus, drunk, so everyone is really social. (The two strangers who met on the bus next to me got REALLY social, if you know what I mean.)\n3) The hosts are awesome. They drank with us, had a pole dancing dance off, and were just genuinely nice.\n4) The bus was surprisingly clean and comfortable. It's nice to sit for a bit after dancing. And it felt like a party in there.\n\nWhy it's bad (and no, the bads are not that bad):\n1) Casinos are huge so there's still a bit of walking from bus drop off to the clubs.\n2) The free shots on the bus taste like cough medicine.\n3) If two bachelor parties end up on the same bus, it's a freaking sausage fest (you can switch buses later, so it only matters in the beginning.)\n4) There's a little down time when people are waiting to leave the club. Everyone's just kind of standing around."
1,"My son loves this place. He is tall enough where he can drive the go karts himself. \nBest deal is to get the $20 unlimited 1 hr pass  and let the kids run wild.\n\nThey have kiddie coaster and airplane ride. Giant potato sack slide and even go karts for adults. \n\nIf your over the giant singing mouse and tokens give this place a try, they are mascot free!!"
1,"Wow.  Just wow! \n\nThis would be a 5 star review, but our service knocked it down a star\n\nWe waited about 45 minutes, but enjoyed the ambiance and the art work on the wall.  When we were seated, I already knew we were going to order the tableside guacamole (one of the items I found to be a bit over priced)  $12 for a pretty small bowl of guacamole.  Yes, it was fantabulous, so in the end I didn't mind paying...but it was a pretty small bowl to be shared between 3 people.  It was made very quickly (with little/no interaction from our server...when I noticed the other server in the area was laughing and explaining the process to his tables....however, our server was not the most personable of fellows...) and with very fresh ingredients, cilantro, jalapeno, pomegranate seeds...opted for no onions, and topped with fresh lime juice and seasonings.  It was delicious.  I also have to add that the tostadas that they use are fantastic.  Crispy, thick, not greasy or salty at all!\n\nWe ordered a couple of drinks, I chose my go-to drink: Michelada with Tecate.  I went picosito and it was delicious.  The right amount of hot sauce, lime juice and beer!  A friend of mine ordered the spicy margarita (which our server forgot and had to be reminded) and she loved it!  \n\nAs for our meals, 2 of us chose the Mariscos enchiladas.  A white cream sauce with oaxaca cheese, bay scallops, shrimp...HUGE shrimp cooked to perfections, and crab meat.  A few hunks of calabasitas and it was ...TO...DIE...FOR!!!  The sauce really complimented the various seafood and not one of the ingredients overpowered any other.  \n\nThe birthday girl opted for the carne asada tacos with spicy fries....spicy? Not so much...but very tasty!  \n\nWe were stuffed.  But...it was my friend's birthday so we had to have some dessert!  We looked over the menu and before we could finish deciding, they brought over the best flan I have ever had in my life!  The consistency was ideal and it was covered with this caramel sauce and candied pecans.  Needless to say, we made room for the flan!  \n\nWe were beyond satisfied with our meal, however...the service we received left a lot to be desired.  I found myself envious of the other tables who were greeted with smiles and had a server that waited for his customers to finish their sentences.  Ours made us feel as if we were a burden and he had better things to do.  He never acknowledged our orders and just walked away when we finished...almost before we finished and was always looking around instead of making eye contact.  \n\nI will be back and hopefully the service I receive will warrant me doing the well-deserved 5-star marking for this place!\n\nThank you Chef Silvana!  You are a gem in the Valley of the Sun!"
0,"Nothing really great about this place. They've got nice posters on the wall, but that's about it. Their fries are mediocre at best, and the dogs are pricey. Oh and instead of having a baseball game on like they should, they decided for some odd reason to have fox news on. Bad choice.\nGo to weinersnitzel's on eastern/serene instead. You're not missing anything, and it's cheaper."
1,"Once again, loved this place.  Our waiter, Raymond, was a great guy.  On top of all of our requests.  We happened to be here during the running of the Kentucky Derby.  Place was hopping. We will always have a fond memory of this place on that particular day, as my wife won her first bet on the Derby.  Dinner was basically free!!!\n\nI had the fish tacos, SO good!  She had chicken taquitos.  Though the chips and salsa come for a small cost, Raymond gave us extra to go, which was very much appreciated.  I have to say, possibly the best part of my meal was the salsa.  IMO, some of the tastiest salsa ever.\nGreat environment within NYNY."
1,"Being from TX and OK most of my life, I have a certain expectation for Mexican food, and unfortunately numerous places I tried in Phoenix haven't fit the bill - until I found this place.  Only drawback is the menu is small (no fajitas for example), but if you are looking for good chips and salsa and a good enchilada then look no further.  Keep in mind this place looks like a complete hole, and only takes cash.  Enjoy!"
0,"Food is good, The management is horrible. The girl Tomimi or whatever her names is. Doesn't have a clue on what she is doing. The service is kind of slow. I ate there twice and both times The next day didn't feel so good.. My stomach was acting up. I wouldn't recommend this place. I would rather eat at Monta until the management gets better. My servers when I ate there were Brittany and Keoni. They were really great . They kept checking up on me and really seem like they knew what they were doing. The guy always made sure I had drinks and made sure everything was alright real great hospitality.. The girl did the same they worked really well this was the second day they opened. The next time I went there I got a different server who did alright he left me hanging a couple times which is the reason I feel this place deserves a lower rating. Foods good management not really and some servers are good some aren't so much. If you go there ask for Brittany or keoni I think that's what his name was."
1,"We recently went to Las Vegas and ate at Stack which we loved. We went to Stack around 5:30 before seeing \""Love\"". If you make an early reservation, you will receive excellent customer service like we did from Vince. He was extremely friendly and gave us some great recommendations. All four of our meals were super yummy. I also like the atmosphere of the restaurant, yes it's a little on the dark side but very cool."
0,"Huge fan of Gordon Ramsay, however the hells kitchen burger I ordered was not as expected. I ordered to go and waited half an hour for my food to arrive. When I bit into the burger it was overly salty, as if the person who was seasoning the meat dropped a whole canister of salt into the patty. It's probably because I ordered around 11:45pm and they close at 12am so they didn't care about the standards and said \""f\"" it, they can't complain after we close. So disappointed."
0,"I have come to this place on five occasions and every single time I have been let down. Even before they opened and gave me the food for free. Every time there has been a problem. I don't get the whole we make our Hollandaise in the morning crap! So I am eating old sauce? For the price it should be made fresh for each plate. This isn't McDonalds is it? They make it from a make line and they can't make regular Hollandaise at any point because it \""throws off their line.\"" \n\nI'm over it, the food is tasty but the staff are always flustered or over worked, and asking for something besides directly what's in the menu is always a fiasco.\n\nThe hipster crowd looks just as good as the food but for the price I would choose a different Benedict place for sure. But if you want to be seen at a cool place this is it, but not my type."
0,"Oh I miss my old china a go go on Ann and Decatur. :(  This one is closer to my new apartment and they fall way short.\n\nI called in my order for vegetarian pad thai with extra noodles and a thai tea. When I showed up they were rude and gave me a dirty look when I asked for crunchy noodles. My Pad thai was ok, but not as saucy and delicious as usual and kinda cold. \n\n I have always been a steady regular at the other one, but I guess I will have to find a new chinese restaurant. Shame. :("
1,"$12.50 for a massage!??!?!  How awesome is that? \nYeah, they are students, but mine was good at what she did.  I asked her to focus on my back and neck, which she seemed to interpret to mean ignoring my arms and not having me turn over, but overall, I felt like the problems I came in with were addressed.\nI would go here every weekend if I lived in the armpit that is Phoenix."
0,"WORST DENNY'S EVER. I should have went to McDonald's for fast food instead. The bathrooms reeked of weed. The food was cooked slow when there was no one else in the restaurant. My pancake puppies came out burnt. I ate them anyways because I was so hungry. When my food came out, I was greeted with a quesadilla that had barely any cheese in it. To add salt to wound, they used American sliced cheese it! How do you mess up something that is one of the easiest foods to make?? My boyfriend's chicken wrap was made with very hard tortilla. \n\nThe place I guess is under new (mediocre) management. There was only one server and one manager who was the cook. Never going there again. \n\nZero stars if that was possible. No actually. Just go out of business already. I'm sure it went under new management for a reason"
0,"Everyone was raving about this place.  Pictures made it look super awesome.  \n\nPlease don't believe when people tell you this is the buffet to check out.  Food was TERRIBLE... I didn't even go for seconds.  I couldn't eat what was in my plate.   Poor choice in food combination.   After the disappointment of the food, I was hoping the dessert was going to be the topping to what every foodie was raving about. COMPLETE disappointment, I couldn't believe  dessert looked so good but tasted like NOTHING!!!   The Wickedspoon needs to step it up.  Not worth what your paying for.         \n\nHonestly, I was expecting so much more...."
1,"Yes, I went there because of Bar Rescue. Beer was good, selection was great. The Stout was tasty. Bartender was friendly, attentive. Comp'ed the first round because I through a 20 into the poker machine. More women than men hanging out there.\n\nAll in all a nice, clean place to grab a drink and get away from the over the top vegas life and get more local."
0,"We were really excited to see KA and it started out interesting, but quickly went downhill.  If you've seen other Cirque shows and liked them, there's a good change you'll be disappointed witht his one.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there were a few impressive scenes, but the majority lacked the breathtaking acrobatic stunts and was mostly filled with a story line that was hard to follow since they spoke in \""ka\"" and WAY too many sword fights.  The only good scene was the jungle-tarzan-esque scene.  \n\nAll in all it was 90 minutes that seemed like an eternity for all 4 of us.  I think I almost fell asleep 4 times, which is really disappointing because I've really enjoyed all the other cirque shows that i've seen.  Skip this one and pay the extra money to go see O."
1,"Love Pin Kaow.  We moved to California in 2009 and miss a good inexpensive Thai restaurant in the Murrieta area.  We visited Pin Kaow multiple times and never had a bad experience.  Pad Thai, crab rangoons, curry, sticky rice were our regular orders there and we always got the same, great, consistent food.  We were recommended to go there by friends and have sent many referrals there of our own."
0,"Like most 'casinos', this one does not care about you, in anyway, shape or form... You are a dollar sign to it. I was asked to leave its poker room, but only after i accepted playing with regulars for over 6 hours, and only after i was down.\n\nThey do not care how you get home, only that you get off of their property. \n\nThey put me in a 'car' that did not have a meter, and the 'driver' kicked me out in the middle of nowhere because I would not show him my 'Money'. \n\nNot quality... will never return."
0,"I used to be a big fan of Nellos but they are really cheapskating these days.   Ordered 2 Extra large pizzas(supposed to be 14\"" but only measures 12\"") for take out.  I guess they measure the crust going up one inch on each side but its the smallest 14\"" pizza Ive ever seen and the pepperoni pizza had very sparse toppings like half of what anyplace else gives.   I still like the taste of the pizza but what a ripoff this place is these days.   Called to complain about my 12\"" pizza after ordering the 14\""s and they told me to order another on if its not enough.   Never again!"
0,"Not impressed at all.  Went there yesterday (a Friday) with my wife and some friends of hers from work.  The placed wasn't packed yet at all as it was only 5:00 when we all got there.\n\nService was very slow for getting drinks but reasonable for food that was ordered.  \n\nMany apps were ordered including wings, mushrooms, zucchini, chicken strips and the reuben dip.  Reuben dip was pretty good.\n\nMy wife ordered the fish and chips which was good.\n\nReason I gave this two stars is because I ordered the one thing that should be perfect in ANY Irish place.  The Shepard's Pie.  Hands down the WORST I've ever had.  Can't believe a chef in an Irish restaurant would send that out."
1,"For some reason, I really thought I reviewed this already?? Any who!\nI just recently brought some family members here. Wife and I have been here three other occasions. The casino is fun, can get crowded during the winter! (Snowbirds in town). My only issue, they really don't have a sport  book! Or an area were some of us men would like to set back, watch some games, drink some beer, and eat. They do have a small area by the Keno area, but it's not much. Overall we always have a good time here, but we will try out the other casinos just to see how it is."
0,"Taken my daughter to this office a few times, but won't anymore. The good points- the office is clean. The staff that answers the phone is nice and usually helpful.  The hygienists are all really nice and are kid friendly.  On the downside- when you walk into this place it just feels cold.  The staff won't even greet you since you have to sign in at a computer.  Dr. Ash wasn't as kid-friendly and a little bullish with my daughter.  I understand she was crying, but she didn't do anything to make her feel more comfortable.  They seem to be all about money; they are very aggressive about making future appointments and overcharging when they can.  I would not recommend anyone to this place."
1,"BACON SAUCE!!!!! \n\nIt's mention in the menu peaked my curiosity and honestly tasted good for a couple of bites. But by the end of the brioche I started feeling pretty queezy from the hog fat overload. And I can't help but feel a little out of sorts when I think about Over Easy since. The brioche was also pretty frickin tiny for being on their \""entree\"" menu. Maybe bacon sauce is elsewhere without my knowledge, but it seems like a bizarre and gratuitous invention that should be avoided unless you're are heavily intoxicated.\n\nSo why do I still go four stars on this place? Probably the time and care put into everything they bring out to you. The menu is ambitious, so I guess they do have time to concentrate, but there is just something to a perfectly made hearty pancake from the right ingredients.\n\nSo  I guess this is where you come for no-nonsense breakfast food made perfectly, but as said before, the prices just don't make a lot of sense when you have to keep ordering things a la carte to work off that hangover. Although maybe not as stupid as their 1130 a.m. closing time, even on weekends when hoards of people are still driving up and trying to get a table at noon."
0,"Wow!  Let's just say I'm super disappointed!  I've seen this show now five times over the past four or five years.  Of the 5...the past four were mild to great.  They've toned the show down so much and now have less experienced talent than before.  I'm sure there's more than one cast but I've always seen a very talented cast.  Sooo...every time I've seen the show they've changed it more and more.  Pretty much for the worst.  This last time was so unbelievable how bad it was I wanted my money back.  After politely contacting Cirque they do not bother to respond.  So now...the gloves come off!  Wow....Cirque!  You're really something else.  Another big company that doesn't give a rats _ _ _ about our hard earned money!   They take your $168 per seat and give you a show now that's so bad...really take my advise...do not go see it.  You'll be sorry!  I feel bad for the very talented performers mixed with other folks, notice I didn't say other performers, that just stand there and look pretty.  What a disappointment for someone that works so hard and proud to be a part of something so spectacular to just end up having a \""bla\"" cast to work with.\n\nLet's talk about the show.  Back...oh...I would say four or five years ago when I saw the first show.  Wow!  I was really on the edge of my seat.  Let's compare the differences from then to now.\n\nFirst...opening sequence.  Before no narration...now there is.  Not needed really.  I have no judgment either way.\n\nSecond...the rotating stage comes out of the \""Void\"" where it appeared to be a ship with rowers. This turned into a ritual scene.  This involved multiple people doing acrobats, sword stunts, spear stunts and let's say lots of action and energy.  So much happening you would want to come back and watch again to catch what you missed.  The next three shows pretty much the same.   However, this last show...wow...people just standing on the stage on both sides while one so called performer twirls a stick and occasionally slaps it on the ground.  My head was nodding like you see some folks in church.  I was really really very unhappy with what I saw.  My niece and nephew were like...huh?  What's all the hoopla?  Great music but no action to match.  Something just did not add up here.\n\nThird...the long haired villain, which I've always liked.  He was so much fun even though he was the bad guy.  He was not there this evening but they replaced him with a far less experienced person.  Notice again I did not say performer.  This guy did not even climb on the wall near the battle scene towards the end of the show.  To make matters worse, near the end of the battle scene, the \""emperor\"" (guy in yellow shoes) falls in pain due to one of his warriors, one of many dies.  What?  My niece and nephew said the same thing.  What's so important about the regular fighter?  It just didn't have the energy there had it been the villain.  In the past four shows, when the villain is defeated and fallen...the stage rotates with theatrical fog, lights, and music to match.  The emperor comes over to comfort his fallen com-rad as the stage rotates downward into the void.  A scene that stuck with me from the beginning.   This time it just lost it's energy and for my niece and nephew they were confused as to what the point was.\n\nFourth, the jungle scene...in the past the jungle music always began with the scene.  This time...the jungle scene was about over when the jungle music came on.  Later when we were discussing the show my niece and nephew said...oh was that a jungle?  Duh...\n\nCirque...music is really key to a production.  You know that!  \n\nThe jungle scene was followed by the air ballet for lack of a better way to describe.  These two individuals put on a stellar performance.  She's nicely shaped and petite and he's very strong.  Fake long hair.  Oooopppss...I think I'm going bald!  \n\nThe Mexican wheel stuntmen always put on a absolute hair raising performance.  You always hear the audience gasp and a super cheer for them.  Applause to you guys!!!\n\nFifth...the rotating stage.   During the scene where there are supposed arrows hitting the ground.  They simulate this with spikes or stems that come up from the rotating stage floor.  With semi slip shoes and these spikes they used to rotate the stage really fast with the performers moving all over.  This included folks falling into the void.  That was really crazy to watch.  This last time though...wow...they just chase each other and some falling with the stage moving ever so so slow.  When the stage did speed like in the past, everyone just hung on to the spikes and or edge.  Acting like they're trying to keep from falling off.  Really not exciting at all.\n\nI could keep writing but I think I've given Cirque too much of my time and money.  Bottom line is..they have this spectacular stage, theater, and music but the actors are not always up to providing the best performance possible.  Cirque has lowered it's standards, not prices."
1,It took a while for them to get to know me but I regularly visit this location. Everyone is great and always great me with a smile.
1,"Walked in here at around 9pm originally just wanted some cocktails , the hostess asked of we would like a table & also offered the bar . We went for the bar because at this point we didn't know if we were guna grab anything to eat , Tara was our bartender she was hands down one of the best bartenders I have ever had the pleasure to meet , both me and my boyfriend are in the industry & we were both impressed by her hospitality . She had no problem explaining the drinks to us and giving us recommendations. We had a few cocktails , that were great we had a Flatbread the jalape\u00f1o poppers and dessert. The bourbon brownie was heaven ! Anyways to make a long story short this place rocked ! They have a great place going here , we will be back soon!  Thank you tara! & thank you Carson kitchen for the great food !"
1,"Toni has been a god send with a very reactive dog that I had.  We worked hard, did the training and the investment of time, but Toni was the one that was able to talk me through my options.  She is invested in her commitment to what she does and is amazing in how she works with these dogs.  I have referred several other people to her that have been very happy."
1,"Delicious, off the wall breakfasts in HUGE portions, make this a place to check out.\nTo give you an idea of what I mean by \""off the wall\"", how about a 24oz. can of Budweiser served in a brown paper bag? Yep, it's on the menu. The Bloody Mary's are huge & tasty.\nJust a fun place to take people for breakfast. But be ready to wait, this place is ALWAYS poppin'!"
0,Hav to pay for refill......use to be free but they got cheap.
0,"very small and dirty looking and nearly no parking.  as we were in the mood for soul food and lolo's was closed, we read reviews for this place and decided to give it a shot. we called ahead, as we are 30 minutes away, the young lady on the phone told us that they would be open until 10pm. great we thought. we showed up around 645 pm and there was nobody but a gentleman at the register, chatting it up and belly laughing as we stood there awkwardly not being acknowledged. we decided to seat ourselves, we sat nearly 5 before the gentleman motioned that the menus were up where he was, still on the phone mind you. we sat and looked over the menus, still not having been greeted by anyone. 10 minutes or so later, a young woman comes out from the back and rudely states that we must leave. we asked, why? her response was they were closing in a couple minutes, and if we wanted to order we could only choose from their two specials. we mentioned that we spoke to a young woman over the phone and she had stated that they would remain open until 10pm. she replied no, nobody said that. we are certain it was her to which we spoke, as we even double checked the phone number dialed against the one on their flyers that were at the register. sorry can't review the food, may have been great but their hospitality was not. this horrible experience didn't ruin the night as we had great bbq at famous daves instead."
0,"Today was my second time visiting. First time was okay. However, it appears that today the owner/manager was more interested in his bottom line. He missed me ordering their below average breakfast selections and less than okay coffee, so as lunch was nearing he asked that I please move to smaller table (the place was not busy). This would be fine if he had asked everyone in a similar situation, but he did not. Not to worry as I took my business up to Copper Star Coffee."
0,"I think I went in with really high expectations & something completely different in mind.\n\nI think the best part of the musical was the beginning and the end where they perform \""The Circle of Life\"".  Everything else was pretty... boring.  The animal costumes, stage setting, props, and lighting were pretty cool, but definitely not breathtaking.  I wanted to like it since it was Disney but I just wasn't feeling it.  Neither was my family, since my mother fell asleep at one point.  I also felt like the choreography wasn't very synchronized, which made me wonder whether or not these were the same performers from New York, who were also in Los Angeles for a brief while.\n\nI honestly think the Lion King show down in Disney World was more entertaining.  Maybe because it was a smaller venue?  Even Mamma Mia! was much more fun and interesting.  But the best Las Vegas show I've ever seen?  Celine Dion HANDS DOWN and of course, Phantom of the Opera at the Venetian.\n\nAlso, the woman sitting behind me would NOT stop talking, going \""ooooh\"", \""aaaah\"", \""so beautiful!\"", \""amazing!\"", \""wonderful!\"", etc. during the performance.  She would constantly laugh like one of the hyena's up on stage at everything Pumba and Timba were saying.  At one point, I couldn't even hear the performer's dialogue 'cause she wouldn't stop laughing.  Annoying!\n\nP.S. I'm sure if you love the animated version (which I don't), then you'll probably love this musical adaptation.  As for seating, the theatre is designed sort of like a stadium movie theatre but I recommend sitting in Section B.  I sat in Section B during Mamma Mia! and could see everything up-close so it was pretty amazing (whereas for Le Reve, the higher the seats, the better).  For The Lion King, we sat in the front section of F and although it wasn't far, I didn't enjoy it as much."
1,"This is one of the better self-serve yogurt places in town. Their flavors are very inventive and rotate on a regular basis. The yogurt itself tastes better than other places I've tried. Seems like the put better ingredients.  Their toppings are also a wider selection than other yogurt places I've been too. I like that they had a girl standing next to the machines offering sample cups and suggestions for what to try. Its better than going up to the front asking for cups from behind the counter. The area is really nice too with AJs, starbucks and Flos in the same shopping center. I didnt really pay attention to price but I didnt find it any more expensive than other yogurt places."
0,"If you enjoy low quality food full of GMO, this is your restaurant.\n\nTo be fair, we dined there several times over the last few years out of desperation.  Good Mexican food is lacking in Henderson, NV.   The chips taste like they contain a sawdust filler as a binding ingredient.  \n\nUntil this restaurant we have never experienced \""dry\"" pico de gallo.  No lime or lemon!  Unbelievably they always use tomatoes that are near white as the tasteless onion they use.  Unsatisfying, tasteless and cheap ingredients.\n\nThere is a reason for the dim lighting in the restaurant and that is because if you could actually see the artificial color in the cheese, you might not eat the meal (sorry but I can't even call it food).\n\nThere is no pride in food at this establishment. It is over rated.\n\nFor excellent mexican food with flavor visit Leticia's, La Comida, Denudo or Mi Casa.  Taste the difference for yourself."
1,"Awesome place that reminds me so much of home back east. I grew up on seafood like this: crab legs, blue crab, crab dip and bisque! Yummy! Even the decor reminds me of the crab houses back east. All they need to add is Yuengling beer. Our server Matt (I think) was wonderful, very knowledgable about the dishes and tastes and provided great service. Their prices are pretty great.  Also, they occasionally offer groupons and they have nightly specials. I am a regular as long as I'm in Vegas."
0,"This is a full service Wells Fargo branch, complete with all the full inside banking as well as a drive thru.  Most of the employees here and nice.  I've had a few grumps deal with me before, but they weren't so bad that I got pissed off.\n\nBeing that it's on the corner of Durango and Warm Springs, it can make entering and especially exiting the parking lot a bit of a hassle.  It's just a very busy intersection with a non-stop flow of cars from all angles, so waiting a few minutes to pull out can unfortunately be normal here.  For that reason alone I don't use this branch that frequently, even thou it is the closest one to my house.  Unless I just need to do that quick transaction, or if it's late when the traffic has died down a bit and I need to hit the ATM real quick, I usually stick to the branch off of W Tropicana."
1,"My mainstay of food has changed drastically within the last month or two my food intake has relied mainly on take out of my favorites and fast food.  If I do review fast food it is not the food I am reviewing because there is a standard of quality that must be maintained or the standard of the fast food chain will be compromised however that changes within the management of each chain.  \n\nWhew with that said, The quality of every meal I get here is excellent as far as fast food goes.  However the quality of customer service goes above and beyond.  They are super nice in the speaker always polite and the order is also correct as well as the side/sauces!  I am always happy and happy to be happy in the speaker and at the window to the employees because they are so nice!\n\nI will continue to eat here because I have never had a problem and the employees are so extremely NICE whats up?! Thank you..."
0,"Me and my partner has been bringing our adorable dog here since she was a pup and every time it has been pleasent except for today.......... Usually one of the nice girls cleans and trims our dog's nails and never once has there been an issue, but today some guy done her grooming and when we got in the car her nails look like they were butchered and she still smells the same........just for future reference they have lost my business"
0,"What the h*ll?\n\nWe had just finished up a conference in the Mesa area and with few dining options available at 11:00 pm, other than Denny's, and that was NOT going to happen, we opted for BJ's Brew House.  As a adamant hater of chain restaurants, I did not have high expectations of this establishment and, well, still don't.  Yes, it's cheap, the food offerings mediocre and boring and the service disinterested, but when the choices are between Denny's and BJ's, I'll opt to fast for the evening next time.  Really, it is a small wonder why those who live in the suburbs are so overweight with so few healthy dining options."
1,"I would have to say TENDER is one of the best steakhouses in Vegas. They've an awesome selection of Kobe beefs from the US, Japan, NZ and AU. We've been to TENDER 4x in the past two years. The wine selection is also great. We usually start out with a Willamette Valley Pinot then to a Sonoma Cab, and end the evening with a Port. If you don't like steak, their lobster is a good alternative. Give them a try!"
1,"I work near by and my coworkers and I share the same good taste in foods so we used to order from here a lot. \nI had everything in their lunch menu and everything is delicious, I can't tell you how happy it makes me that they have, not only tofu, but faux meat! We used to order a lot but one time I went to pick up our food they haven't even made it and ended up waiting so long that I was 1/2 hour late past my lunch break. \nMy husband and I eat here when we're in the area and we both really like it. They ask how much heat you like (I'm a 5) and they really get it right. \nSo, we may not be able to order out from here because of that one problematic instance but I will still eat here every chance I get."
0,"This was one of the worst experience's I've had! Customer service was horrible, since I cannot leave the rating zero, I am forced to give them a one, but believe me I wouldn't go back if it was free!  \n\nLet me explain, we walked in for a hot bowl of noodles, and the place had maybe 8 tables of people.  We were shown a table and sat down, and that was it, no one came over to take our order, we were there maybe 10 minutes when a bus load of people came flooding through the doors and scrambling for free tables, they were placing orders and their food came flying out, one after another, it was horrific.  I finally got someones attention and they took our order.  \n\nFinally, our food came out but they kept pushing us around, first by asking that we move to a single table, we had been seated by them at a table for four, so we complied, then when my husband made his way to the counter to pay, I was still slurping my noodles, they showed people to sit at our table, I wasn't even done eating and they were pushing us out to make room for 'THE BUS' people.  I have never felt so unwanted, I was a paying customer too!  I wanted to sit and enjoy my meal, and yet I was rushed, pushed out of my seat!\n\nI couldn't take it any more, I was livid, so I walked out, disgusted with the whole experience, and I will not go back!"
1,"Healthy, fast, breakfast food. Not sure why this is such a novel idea.  \n\nSo scrumptious- I crave it even when I'm not in a big hurry. Their breakfast burritos are great. So good that I don't think I've ever ordered anything else. I need to branch out."
0,"I love this kind of place. \nUnassuming, local greasy spoon-style diner. The staff was as friendly as could be. It was a Sunday, people were chatting. We ordered at the counter, got out glasses filled up with soda and took a seat.\nThe wait was longer than most fast foodies are used to, but to me, it was expected and welcome, fresh diner food made to order takes a tad longer than a microwave.\nThe Bride and I both had a Giant cheeseburger w fries. Granddaughter has hot dog and grandsaon a burger. (the kids being 5 and 12 were the ones who were used to fast food times) \nWhen brought to the table, the burger as shown in yelpers photo's... nothing magical, and certainly by todays indulgent standards FAR from \""giant\"" but a solid diner burger.\nFresh fries, nice hot, and crispy.\nHot dog, was a standard hot dog on a fresh bun.\n\nSo hey buddy... whats up with two stars?\nThe burger was as dry as could be! I couldn't understand it, fresh meat, not sitting out under a lamp to become shoe leather... (I've seen some sins done to meat in diners let me tell ya!)\n\nThen I saw that when cooking the patty, the cook puts one of those bacon weights on it and leaves it there. I could see the fat being squeezed out of it. \nLike greasy tears.\n\nPerhaps the breakfast is good, I don't know, seems like the sort of place it would be OK. But I just cant give more than two stars,,, \nI wanted to like it more, but frankly, a dry patty is a deal breaker to me."
1,This place is awesome.  Looks like a true hole-in-the-wall from the outside. Very unassuming.  But inside is actually quite nice with colorful chandeliers and a nice bar area - bathrooms were nice too-  \n\nThe food is phenomenal.  And cheap!!!  Go on Tuesdays - special is the carne adovada.  And the carne adovada is to die for.  Two people can easily split one order and be totally full.  You can cut the meat with a spoon.  Mmmmm so yummy just thinking about it.  I want to try other food choices but I just know I won't be able to tear myself away from re-ordering the adovada.  \n\nEveryday of the week a different menu choice is on special so make a week out of Blue Adobe :)
0,"This place gets one star.\nWhy?\nBecause of the proliferation of snotnose owners.That's why.\nClassic Phoenix ridden Children of The Corn mentality.\nThey don't know you?\nYou're not welcome.\nHostile,rude,obnoxious,condescending group of assholes who congregate in their asshole pods to size up the new entrants into the park.\nGods forbid your dog goes to play with any of theirs either.\nBetween the nasty remarks,dirty looks and them pulling their oh so hi falutin mutts away when play does ensue,I find it a dissapointment at best to have to take dogface here.\nI have never seen this level of anti social behavior anywhere else in the world.\nThis dog park's overall mentality is a prime microcosm example of what I despise about Phoenix."
1,"Earl of Sandwich is a great sandwich place.  It is the hybrid of a Quizno's sub with a hot pocket.  Pretty cheap for a Vegas food option.  The location here at the Palms is nowhere near as crazy as the one in Planet Hollywood.  It is also a bit smaller.  Each time I have come here there were no lines.    I have tried all of their sandwiches and thought they were all pretty good, with Montague and tuna being the standouts."
0,"Very long wait (I get it, you're new). It seems like drive thru staff at window don't pay attention. They tried to send me on my way without giving me half my order. \nI ordered an iced mocha that came completely unstirred. What I ended up with was a mouthful of chocolate syrup, because the milk/espresso was all on top, with a pile of chocolate on the bottom. What drive thru DOESN'T STIR DRINKS? (Yeah, that's what we want to do, open a drink, in our car, and try to stir chocolate syrup into a cold beverage...)\nThe sandwich was good, though VERY small compared to places like wildflower bread Co., and paradise bakery. Also, the tuna to mayo/dressing ratio seems to be off. I feel like I got a sandwich that was mostly mayo. I don't think I'll return for that. \nAll in all, 11 bucks (after tax) for a coffee drink and a sandwich. That price seems high, for what I received, after a verrrrrry loooonnnnggg wait. I think I would rather go elsewhere."
0,"First time in since they renovated the natural history section. Wow, it was actually shocking how much it has changed (and not for the better). I remember the museum as a Victorian Natural History museum with hundreds of different exotic animals that you could spend hours looking at quietly. \nNow it has become very 'kid-friendly' with lots of things for screaming kids to jump on and touch. \nAs a child I used to be able to spend hours walking through the Natural History galleries , now I left after 10 minutes having seen everything.\nDisappointing."
0,"Worst service EVER for large parties. We had a party of 12 in celebration of my father in law's 50th birthday. We ordered our food and it took over a hour and a half for it to come out!!! I'm sorry but that's just terrible. Every time we asked the waiter about our food he said \""Oh, it will be out in a few minutes\"". We watched every table around us eat their food and leave before we even got our food. These parties were anywhere from 6-10 people so I don't understand why it took so long for 12 people. \n\nThe food itself was nothing impressive either. The best part about the dinner was probably the Indian fry bread. Everything else was edible.\n\nWe will definitely never be eating here again."
0,"Family business or not; thieves are thieves.\n\nThey re-plumbed my kitchen sink, then made off with my additional s-traps and plumbing tape. Then they bill me for the parts!!! WTF!!\n\nI called \""Dave the plumber\"" and asked him to return my parts. He said that he would. NEVER DID. Lame.\n\nStay far away from Jack Dish."
0,"This is my 3rd time visiting this place. On my first 2 visits here I thought the food was fantastic.  This time it was very disappointing.  We had the Caramelized Salmon ($14), Vietnamese ribs ($15)and Crispy Shrimp Rolls (5 Pieces for $8).  The Crispy Shrimp rolls are not worth the price.  The rolls are so small and you could barely taste the shrimp in it.  I thought the Caramelized Salmon was a bad idea.  The Vietnamese Ribs were dry and portions of it were burnt.  I'm not sure I will be returning.  I noticed that the prices have increased since my last visit.  So on the positive side, the service was excellent."
1,"My family lives out here in Arizona and me and my fiancee came here for her birthday. Showed up 25 minutes late because of an accident on the freeway and they didn't mind one bit. Nice as ever. The two Davids were our servers. Soooo nice. Recommended the chefs selection over a LA carte and saved us 65$. Unheard of. We aren't first time steak house eaters so it was a shock to hear a waiter recommend spending less money.\n   So the food. I got the lobster bisque to start. Awesome. Then the 16 oz. Rib eye medium. Wow wow wow. Seriously, no lie. Better then the 33 oz. Bone in rib eye at mastros and 35$ less. Comes out on a 500 degree platewith butter sizzling. For my fiancee she got the petite filet with shrimp. Soo good and iI don't really care for small filets. We shared the lobster mac and cheese. Self explanatory. So much lobster 5 oz. Then the creamed spinach. And we shared the shrimp cocktail Zero complaints. And we are somewhat picky. Drinks were awesome. Strawberry basil giblet and for me my usual Jameson and ginger ale. \n  Dessert needs its own section. For me I try and get creme brulee anywhere I eat. This honestly tasted better than Mortons. She got the caramelized banana cream pie. Yea you read that right. The best ever.\n  So in finishing chose ruth Chris and ask for the Davids to serve you. We were going to j&g at the Phoenician but steered cleared after seeing the horrible reviews and only the view being good. Plus 400$ dinner thats ehhh vs Ruth Chris at 201$? Why go anywhere else. Please take me serious I'm a 6'4\"" 300 lb. Man. I've eaten. I don't ever write reviews but this place really stuck with me."
0,My wife and I went to MG on Friday 8/8/14 at 6:15 PM.Sat there 15 mins\nBefore our waiter appeared. Ordered chicken parm. Forty minutes later still no food and they wouldn't even produce a manager! We got up and left.\nThis will be our last time.
1,"Fantastic hole in the wall. Cozy ambiance and delicious food. Their fish tacos are amazing, burgers juicy, deviled eggs nicely presented, and pretzel bun are soft. Sausages with curry ketchup and cheese dip was tasty too. The waffles fries is also another fave. All in all, great first time experience."
1,"Odd timing and pacing and incorrect orders served made for an awkward dining experience at the latest spot by Elizabeth Blau and Kim Canteenwalla. Their staff, however, was well trained in the congeniality department, as their friendly demeanor tried to overcome service issues.\n\nA half rack of ribs was as tender and smokey as expected, brushed with a sweet and tangy BBQ sauce. The bacon cheddar biscuit was amazing, trumping any childhood memories of devouring cheddar biscuits from that chain seafood restaurant I won't bother naming. I'm a fan of the mac and cheese, mainly because pork makes everything better. The black mission figs was a refined dish of nuanced flavors that almost seems out of place among all the comfort food. Chicken wings are available in different flavors. The buffalo wings were too subtle and didn't pack enough heat. The crab cake was somewhat underwhelming, mainly because of my irrational east coast bias and the lack of jumbo lump meat, which I prefer.\n\nThis place will only get better once they find their footing. Pricing may turn off some, but their location in Tivoli Village is to blame as I'm sure rent isn't cheap. \n\n3.5 Stars"
0,"Breakfast taco was ok, chicken taco shells were overcooked.  Not as good as Roberto's."
1,"I've always been a fan of this place, but I tried the rubin the other day and I can't stop talking about it.  Just perfect.  I do wish they served fries with the sandwiches.  Considering the no-fries factor I guess the prices are a bit high."
1,"I was visiting from Los Angeles for my little sister's birthday & was skeptical because I'm usually a \""stick with what I know\"" kind of person. Oh, & I'm serious about my cupcakes! =) Well, Cupcake Lane did NOT disappoint! They were exceptional. My sister was excited & loved them. I will recommend them to all my local friends. Thank You!"
1,"Best place for a boba fix! Great milk tea with decent price. Drinks have the right amount of ice and syrup comparing to other Boba places (which give u almost a whole cup of ice with either too much or too less syrup). Location is central in town square and easy to stop by, pick up a drink, and continue shopping or whatnot. Workers are friendly and drinks don't usually take too long to be made and served. Overall, if you are looking for a quick boba fix, lollicup is the place to go!"
0,Good but have had better.....one thing my wife and I did not like is no garnish on burger.   Gotta ask for lettuce tomato pickles onion....really?  My first time there probably last due to 25.00 tab and no offer of toppings.

Free help to your car with your bags...they will never take tips.  \n3. Amazing deli sandwiches and Bakery.  Seriously...ahhhmahhhzing.\n4. Best selection of delicious store made sides ever.  Try the southern potato salad.  Better than my mom's....almost.\n5. Seafood department to rival the coast.\n6. A store that you enjoy being in- No flies, not sticky spots on the floor, no burned out lights, no broken carts.  \n7. FRIENDLY PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI know that they are not as cheap as Wal-Mart but they also seem to care about the people who shop at their store and the people who work there.  \n\nI live 25 miles away and have already been twice.  Harris Teeter has really let their stores go and now with Whole Foods and Publix moving in I hope that they step up their game.  \n\nCan't wait for them to take over Charlotte.  May the best store win!"
1,Ate there with my kids last week \nNot bad \nWorth a try
1,Good food and great prices.  Can't beat $5 shock top pitchers.  Pimento cheese sandwich is awesome and can't go wrong with the burgers...big block southern style!
0,Shockingly bad food and service. We were with a private paryt upstairs so maybe that was the reason for agonizingly slow service but there's zero chance of me returning.
0,"1 star is more than this place deserves.  It's a complete joke in there. \n\n9 21 year old girls on New Years, and we wanted a place that wasn't too expensive, but had an open bar.  Unfortunately, that was I-Bar. The reviews weren't bad and the description and video tour made it out to be an actual club in the Rio. We were with our best friends, in Vegas, at a club.  How bad could it be?  So, $140 later, we had tickets for New Years. \n\nThen we got there... and let me tell you...it was BAD. The 'club' is merely a raised platform bar in the middle of the casino.  It smelled like cigarettes and we were the youngest people there by 30 years.  There was no room to stand and we weren't allowed to sit down because we hadn't purchased a 'table' (why anyone would purchase a table there is beyond me). Then we found out other people had walked in for free. Cool.  \n\nThe fact that they make this place out to be something is not, and charged us anything to get in, is what the real problem is.  Don't be fooled people...its a bar smack in the middle of a casino.  It ruined my New Years and i hope you never have to experience what I did at I-Bar.\n\nI do, however, suggest checking it out if you want a good laugh.  Just picture 9 hot 21 years old girls, decked out for New Years, in the bar and you'll guaranteed get a good chuckle."
1,"Great pizza and great service. I wouldn't eat inside, the tables are set up too close to each other. They have a great patio if it's not too hot/cold."
1,"It's an alright park, handy if you are about that part of town and need a few commodities! \n\nIt's on a good bus route or if you have a car you can park for free.\n\nThere is a sainsbury's, poundland, M&S outlet, B&M store, TK maxx, Gala bingo and pounstretcher. Kinda a bargain store galore - but it serves well."
0,"We stopped in here for a gallon of water and some vitamin waters- pretty dirty place. I watched some chick go to the donut area and naked fist a donut and start eating it, in front of the clerk. Which is ok to them, I guess, but it is so not alright when you hand them an apparently incorrect amount thinking it is. In that case, they yell it even louder. For all we know my boyfriend did give her five dollars, and she took one, and then yelled it was 4.some odd cents making him give her another. Probably did go down that way."
1,Ribeye was so so but the butterfish and fried scallops were amazing! Service was spot on and were very friendly.
0,"I had a renter for some time who let the backyard go...  I knew it was a mess and I was waiting for other plans to start before re-doing the entire landscape of the backyard.\n\nI called Sergio's to have JUST the FRONT yard taken care of on a twice a month schedule.  Three months later, I come home from work to find his guys in my BACK yard.  I get the bill and they apparently spent 6+ hours back there... \n\nI didn't ask them to do the backyard.  I never had.  The agreement was the Front Yard only (for HOA reasons) like they had done for months.\n\nOf course he billed me anyway, then sent it to collections a week later.\n\nI fought it and spent nearly three months going back and forth with his collection company.\n\nThe bright side?   I won."
1,"There is nothing bad to say about JFG! I came for the first time a couple of years ago almost when our best friends moved to Gilbert.  We make sure we go there EVERY TIME we are in the area -- it was also fun to see that it was a Triple D and to check out what items Guy Fieri checked out.  I unfortunately haven't spread out from my norm much because I love my burger with bleu cheese and mushrooms on it! Their different fries like the garlic fries and loaded baked potato fries are delish, and their onion rings are DELIGHTFUL.  They make KILLER homemade lemonade (I get the Strawberry!) and know how to make a mean milkshake.  Everything else I've seen on the menu that people have gotten have looked nothing short of amazing so maybe one day I'll stray from the norm!"
1,This place is wonderful if you love New Mexican food very friendly and only at the $ level which is sweet\n\nGreat place for New Mexican chili
1,"I stopped by on a Sunday evening by myself.  After being told my wait would be an hour, I opted to sit at the small bar at the front of the restaurant. (There is another bar in the back, closer to the patio overlooking the Bellagio fountains.)\n\nI opted for the hanger steak frites ($20.95) and a glass of bartender recommended Cotes du Rhone ($10).  I couldn't finish my meal, despite how delicious it was, although I did have a few pieces of the tasty warm bread.\n\nIn a city where a steak can easily cost $40 a la carte, Mon Ami Gabi is a great find and value if you have the patience to wait for a table."
0,"In sum, I do not recommend eating here. In fact, I feel I am being overly generous giving it 2 stars. I felt, since my picky brother enjoyed his strange meal that I should at least give it 2 stars. If we are to base it solely on my dish and that of my friends- a one star would more than suffice. That being said, I have to wonder if I should have eaten something other than crepes. I see my fellow trusted yelpers enjoyed their meals- but none of them eat the crepes!\n\nEven if I never had a crepe before, let alone the AMAZING light as a cloud crepes from Paris 66 I would still know the crepes served here are largely inedible. But I am getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe place was largely empty when we arrived on a late weekend morning. Only about 3 other tables besides our party of 4. Yet we waited for over an hour for 2 orders of crepes, french toast, and a sandwich. Really? \n\nOur waitress was not much for conversation. My friend, who is notoriously more picky than my brother requested whipped cream instead of something else in her crepe. At first, the waitress tried to convince her not to change the menu as it would annoy the cooks. After a few minutes of talking she finally accepted my friends request. She wanted to add whipped cream not lobster I don't see what the fuss was about to begin with- bygones.\n\nI ordered a fruit crepe. Which the exception of the cooking outcome resembling a burnt-ish flaming campfire marshmallow, folded up like an egg roll, the taste was boring, burnt, and listless. I eat two bites and put down my napkin. I had no idea one could defile a crepe in such a way until that day. \n\nMy friend that requested the whipped cream. If I thought my crepe saw a rough afternoon her looked like it was literally dropped on the floor a few times then thrown on the plate. Guess they showed her for ordering that whipped cream? I can see now why the waitress warned us not to change the menu. May I suggest that their employees partake in some local anger management meetings?\n\nMy brother ordered the savory french toast. Italian made with ham, capicola, salami, pepperoni, and marinara Sauce. He loved it. Then again he also loves McD's and Taco Bell. I did not try his meal, I took his word for it.\n\nMy husband ordered a sandwich The Club- he said it was good. Not bad, not great but good. \n\nLastly, I was not a fan of their coffee either. I could not wait to leave. I only live a few blocks away and needed to go home to make something to eat.\n\nOn a positive note, I loved the Einstein artwork. It was the one positive thing I can recall of our visit."
0,"We went in there on Sunday for lunch, it was packed-well the foyer was at least. After sitting there for ten minutes we were led to a dinig area that was maybe 1/3 full of customers. I was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess. There was one person taking names, another checking the names, two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room. Christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and I'm hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice. So my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner!  The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time. I would love for it to be another 10 years (or more) until I eat here again....glad I wasn't paying for it!"
1,The butternut squash bisque was devine. My wife loved her quiche.
1,"By far the best buffet I have ever been to!\n\nI'm not kidding or sugar-coating.  It was so good.  I recommend their meatloaf.  The sauce on it was amazing.  The whole buffet really is amazing.  I also recommend the ceviche and the desserts are to die for.\n\nThere is generally a bit of a line, like most buffets, but it moves fast.  Its a little expensive, I think like 40 bucks a person, but for what you get it is well worth it.  I make a point to take my family here every time they are in town.\n\nThe decor is beautiful, as is all the decor in the Wynn."
0,"Mediocre in nearly every way. The food is bland and unmemorable, the pricing is a little high for what you get. The service is generally pretty good. There are better breakfast options not too far away."
0,"Blah -- overpriced and bland selection of entries that may upset your stomach, which was enveloped with slow service...\n\nMy wife and I recently  went out to dinner at Paisan's. It is conveniently located near the Monona Terrace and features an attractive combination of traditional charm with magnificent lake views (outdoor seating).\n\nWe ordered the seafood tetrazzini and lasagna. For $14, you get bread and soup or salad and a cheese-spiked rip off. On their menu, they indicated that there would be more than shrimp shrapnel, but that is what we were left with (outside a legion of underwhelming whitefish and cheap scallop pieces). The flavor was bland and unappealing. There was just a mantle of broiled cheese applied so thick, it was a mozzy disaster. Sadly, I had 15 times the shrimp and flavor from the Lean Cuisine I had for lunch. Their lasagna was nearly as poor. \n\nIt was drowned in sauce. When spending time to shovel through the sauce to get to the chunk of lasagna, it was poorly seasoned meat, pasta and cheese concoction. Since I only sampled the tetrazzini, this is what I believe that made for a foul stomach a couple hours later.\n\nThe food would have been sent back, but their overall quality and a Hell's Kitchen waiting time (over an hour) resigned me to the fact that more precious time should not be wasted for marginal improvement. \n\nWhat bothers me is that this joint is getting business left and right by folks led to believe that this eatery serves supreme Italian when you are getting slop. I did not try their self-heralded pizza. They use cheap, low quality ingredients ... they tried to hide it in their entrees, but it would be as obvious with their pies (based on sight and review of their menu). \n\nPaisan's is basing their experience on location, smartly orchestrated ambiance and those ignorant of quality Italian food. Take your cash to a restaurant that gives a damn and visit the beach independent of this made-up dive."
1,Great food and biggest glass of wine EVER.  Very nice people.  And the lunch special is enough for two!
0,"I feel like this place should be rated in WTF's instead of stars because if I was rating in WTF's this place would have like, the highest score of all time.\n\nI went in with a pretty large group at lunch time and my they were eager to eat all of the sushi. So it's not like we were wasting their time. I mean, lunch time... restaurant... hungry people: It all made perfect sense!\n\nWe waited several minutes to be acknowledged. WTF? \n\nOnce the hostess came out of the back we noticed she was on the phone. WTF? \n\nAmazingly, she looked at us and went away again without acknowledging us. WTF?\n\nWhen she came back she was still on the phone. Really? WTF.\n\nThen she pointed and grunted towards the dinning room. WHILE STILL ON THE PHONE. Seriously?\n\nWe sat and she gave us one menu. ONE. There were 5 of us. We had to ask for more menus when we saw her again. She was still on the phone, and without a word she went and grabbed like 2 more menus and kind of threw them at us. WTF? I can't believe that was even real life.\n\nAt this point we were all just madly uncomfortable. Like what if we wanted to ask her for something more complicated than a menu... like SUSHI? She was still on the phone when we walked out and barely glanced at us. WTF.\n\nI guess I can't say anything about the food because I was too busy WTFing to order any. But I definitely wouldn't go back so it doesn't matter if the food is the best. If I want service this terrible I can eat at home where my private cook is NEVER around.\n\nThat is like 8 WTF's in the condensed version of this story. That is like 1 WTF/ minute for this place! Great job!"
1,"Love wine? This is the event for you.\n\nRundown of what you need to know:\n\n-This is an event that IMO the VIP is not worth it. You don't really get all that much more. Some access to a VIP tent that has some cheese and samples of a few other wines. $25-26 for general admission is a great deal to enjoy a day of sips.\n\n-Bring chairs, blankets, etc and enjoy the day. This is a day long festival and Symphony Park is a great place to spend an afternoon. There's live music, food options for purchase and some different craft type tents to explore.\n\n-Parking is free. However, it's hard to find a spot if you don't get there early. The restaurants block off their parking areas and the mall is just busy in general. This is a drinking event. Take a cab or Uber.\n\n-I know it says you can bring kids, make it a family day and what not. However, people get super drunk. Wine drunk. Holy people watching drunk.\n\n-The crowds are not very good at the whole concept of making a line to get a sample after hours of consuming wine. You're going to get a little annoyed. Good thing you brought that blanket, right?\n\n-Seriously, drunk should be in 72 pt font here.\n\nI had a good time meeting all the different vineyards and vendors. I don't know a lot about wine. I buy based on what the label looks like. So, it was good to learn a little bit along the way.\n\nJust like Beer, Bourbon and BBQ (the same people put this on), I think this is a festival that gets a little bit better each year."
0,"Granted, I went to this pool on a weekday...however, I was still not overly impressed with this venue. You would actually think service would be better when it's not busy. First off, we arrived with reservations for a daybed and we waited 20 minutes at the front entrance before being let in. (There was no line). Then our cocktail server was highly disinterested in serving us. Anytime she asked if we needed anything, if we debated for a second about what we wanted, shed'd say,\""I'll come back when you've decided.\"" Then she would wander off like it was busy. The pool overall was pretty with a great view, but I have been to way better pools in Vegas. The drinks were very overpriced (way more than usual Vegas prices at $40-$50 for a 32oz cup) and so was the food. It is a good experience at least once, but I wouldn't necessarily visit again."
0,"The food is whack. Calamari was nothing special. Hong Kong wonton noodle soup was not good. The soup came in a cup and you have to pour it in and it was not hot enough. Service was horrific, slow and rude. Would not recommend this place."
1,"The choices at Jean Philippe Patisserie are very overwhelming making for freeze-brain and therefore no choice at all when trying to figure out what to snack on.  This is a good problem to have.\n\nTheir coffee is wonderful!  This was my morning staple on my past visit to Vegas since I was staying at Aria.  At $4 you will pay about what you are paying at your local Starbucks which is sad but still tasty.\n\nThey literally have everything from cookies, pastries, gelato, chocolate, nuts and even hot food.  \n\nThe prices are high but if you sample small you will watch calories and your wallet."
1,"I went to 808 Sushi with some friends. They picked this restaurant because of the All You Can Eat sushi. I already ate before going to 808, so I didn't eat all I could.\n\nI ordered the salmon teriyaki entree and it was very good. The portion was not huge, but not small either.\n\nMy friends ordered and ate a lot of sushi! The service was good and there was plenty of parking."
0,"For being the only gay club on the strip, this place was a bit of a letdown. Maybe I was expecting the same club quality as the infamous Vegas straight clubs, but sadly, this place just reinforced that if you can't beat them, just do it that much trashier.\n\nA group of us came on a Friday night after searching up and around the strip for the place. Upon arrival, we were able to talk down the bouncer and get in for local price. When we got in, I was pretty surprise by how empty the place was. Everyone was off in their own friends/dance circles, and you could clearly see all the empty spaces in the room, which didn't get filled either. Music was alright, your usual mixes of brit brit, top 40 and top 40 dance remixes. \n\nOne thing that really bugged me was how rude the bouncers were. Our girl friend took off her heels to sit on the couches for a second, and the bouncer immediately told her she needed to put hem on or be kicked out. He proceeded to basically follow her all around ensuring that her bare feet never touched their dirty ass floor. \n\nWait... so you can't have your heels off for a second, but you can have guys running around in just their tight ass bun huggers, practically balls out? Sorry, I love guys as much as the next, but let's not jump on the patriarchy bandwagon that suppresses us all down as well."
1,"The B continues to satisfy. Much better service and ambience than Aria. Also, the Conservatory and lobby are matchless in Vegas. Disagree with the Spa Tower review. The rooms are newer but a bit more sterile. Even with the obvious staff cutbacks the place works. One major deficiency, that has always been there , is the lack of valet service. Too long a line at check in. Not always a welcoming valet. At pickup they hand you your keys if you've called down for the car in advance. Costs them a tip. I don't get it."
0,We went to Sunday Mother's Day brunch. It was 50 dollars plus. I ordered a mimosa assuming it was included like most Sunday brunches but it was extra. I wanted fresh berries but they didn't have any of those either. Great atmosphere but a real rip off on the food side . Really limited selection . A true tourist trap .
0,"What a let down!  Could go to chain steakhouse and get the same taste.  Steaks not cooked correctly. Waitress seemed like we were putting her out everytime we asked for something.  For the price and for the chef's name on it, I expected so much more."
1,"Best sweet potato fries I've ever had. Ever. \n\nJust the right amount of crispy with salt and sugar sprinkled on it and an addictive sweet sauce for dipping. Seriously these things were so good I went back the next night and ordered some to go after having a few drinks. \n\nI honestly don't even remember what my burger tasted like, but if you're staying at/near the Wynn definitely cross the street and check this place out."
0,"I have eaten at this restaurant a few times before and liked it. A nice neighborhood place. So, we thought to go here to celebrate my niece's graduation. We had a party of 10 and the service was terrible.  The servers didn't bring drinks or ask if we wanted anything other than our order. They were all in a back room doing something. And the food was not good, either. I had chicken piccata - yuck. It had a thickish cream sauce - like creamy soup. Not light and lemony like it should be. I do not think I would go back."
1,I love me Mexican food! And being Latina and finding great traditional Mexican food is very hard. This place has won my heart with Mexican food! Delicioso !!
0,"Ah gimme some sugar. Their cakes are amazingly beautiful! I followed them on IG and the constant posts finally convinced me to go in.\n\nI was so so disappointed. I'm big on sweets but I didn't enjoy anything here.\n\nI tried a berry Marscapone cake, a cake pop, two macarons, a Oreo and pudding diet cup. Oh and my sister had a cupcake.\n\nThe cake pop was the best thing.\n\nThe MACARONS had a weird overly sweet whipped cream in them. The cookie part was good but the amount of whipped cream was overwhelming. They are flavored but really don't taste like what they're named because they just taste like whipped cream. Maybe I just got the only two flavors filled with whipped cream. I think it's a cute novelty but it's more like. Crisp whoopie pie or something.\n\nThe Oreo cookie, pudding, and whipped cream cup with a worm in it wasn't good.\n\nThe cake was the most disappointing. I think it was close to $8 bucks. It was really small, the thin layer of berry \""sauce\"" on top was so dry that I couldn't get through it with my fork. It was like super thick fruit leather. \n\nMy sister said her cupcake was good.\n\nOverall it was just disappointed. I had so much expectations since they do cakes for Hakasan and stuff but it was just disappointing. \n\nThe place was very cute and clean but that's all it has going for it in my honest opinion.\n\nThe service was eh."
0,"Attended a gun show that was hosted here a few weeks ago.  The gun show was cool, but the convention center is less than stellar.  Bottom line....it's old, dirty, and tiny.  Add to that, parking is not convenient....the gun show attracts a lot of people and parking was scarce.  If you fell asleep in the 1970's and woke up today, you wouldn't know the difference if you were in this place.\n\nI wouldn't stage events here and would only come back so I can attend a show like this.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%"
0,This place was okay. We stayed in a suite and had to request room service three times before they finally came at 11pm. I was sleeping. The staff is very nice and respectable.
1,"Being a man who just recently lost a ton of weight (and clothes sizes), I am in need of a new wardrobe. I am now in full \""purchase mode\"" and procuring the best shirts, polos, pants, etc, all at the best price. I heard about Rack a couple times, and thought \""Meh, if they have nothing, I only wasted about 10 minutes of my life.\"" Well, lets just say this place is outstanding! Lets run our hands through the Pant aisle at full speed, and discuss Nordstrom Rack:\n\n~What to do~\nBuy buy buy clothes, shoes, perfumes, accessories, etc... ALL at significantly marked down prices.\n\n~The Good~\nTHEY HAVE PENGUIN! I love....love...love this brand. I am not a clothes person persay, but holy God I love this brand. They have it marked way down, at prices which allow me to comfortably stock my closet. The prices for all the designer clothes, for that matter, are outstanding. I was giddy with excitement looking at all the magnificent deals. Everything I got was at least 50% the normal dollar  rate in regular stores or online! I picked around and was able to come out of the store with everything my heart wanted. The selection is outstanding and they do not skimp on the name brands or styles. Everyone is accounted for, and the styles are not the slightest bit garish. Also, service is fast, even with long lines. They are efficient with your time spent in the store in mind. \n\n~The Bad~\nAlthough they are still marked down, the shoe selection is still pricey. I do not suggest buying the shoes, you can go online or to a shoe store to get better deals. Maybe try on the shoes you are looking for, but put them back and save your money. The jeans are also pretty expensive. I am not a jeans guy, so the dollar amounts for the jeans seemed excessive. I am pretty sure I can get the same quality jeans for a quarter of the price somewhere else. I obviously can't vouche for the womens side, they have a ton... so no comment there. That really covers it, not too bad if you ask me.\n\n~The Down Low~\nAll this said, there are many places to get marked down clothes at. I did my homework, the prices here beat markdowns online and even on E-bay for my Penguin brand. The same goes for a lot of brands, I am sure. For designer styles at marked down prices, this is the perfect spot, and its so close to my place. As for my 4-star rating, the strong variety of options, good looking clothes, large list of designer brands, and the quick efficient service keeps this place with a high rating. The poor prices on shoes and jeans knock a star off. I highly recommend shopping here. Why waste your money with markups!?! Come here, and enjoy!"
0,"From the outward appearance, this Wendy's is modern and easily accessible.  The inside is also very ergonomic and very nice.  That's about all the good I can say about it.  \n\nFrom the time we walked in, there was only one register open and the line was to the door.  The child in front of us even screamed he wanted to leave because he wanted to eat and he wanted it now!\n\nWe hesitantly waited 20-25 minutes and I wanted to leave but by then we had too much time invested.  We finally got to place our order and the line behind us was still to the door and the manager even popped up front but refused to acknowledge the crowd and lack of service being given.  Despicable!\n\nTo beat all, the chicken nuggets were cold and dry.  Service was poor and extremely dissatisfying.  I also noticed the drive thru was wrapped around the building and once you got in line, you couldn't get out because of the way it was poorly designed.  You're just stuck.  I don't think we were the only dissatisfied customers that day but I won't go back."
0,"o sole mio.. o sole mio... \n\nI forgot what I ate, and I forgot what I drank..\nSays a lot about this chain restaurant.  While it does not dissapoint, it is not memorable at all.\n\nThe hostess was kinda grumpy. We had an extra person , and she had to move us.. and she was all huff and puff.. I was like, lady, the place is empty.. why you mad?\n\nAnyway, i totally cannot remember what i ate here.."
1,"I love this place because it lets me not leave the office and still get food without ordering at least $20 worth of food. \n\nAlso, the food actuallly quite good if you are in the mood for sandwiches. The fruit salad is good too."
1,I love this promenade!  You have a variety of shops and restaurants and it's a nice change of pace from the rest of the hustle and bustle of Vegas.  It's almost as if I'm walking down 3rd street in Santa Monica.  It's nestled nicely between large hotels so it's often shady.  Great to beat the desert heat!
0,Way too expensive for mediocre Mexcian food.
0,The hostess underestimated the time by half an hour.  Could have chosen another option   When I waited my 45 minutes and went back to check at hostess stand she told me it would be another 25 minutes rather rudely.  The manager Beau defended her by stating it is hot out and people don't rush to leave. No apologizes   The menu has been abbreviated and many items deleted that were popular staples.  I frequent this restaurant and recommend it to many tourists.  Needless to say that won't be occurring any longer
0,"This is our first time trying it and we were hoping it would be satisfying... Unfortunately we didn't think it was very good I had the pork luau sandwich and my husband had the kahuna burger ( teriyaki). The rumbi fries were salty and overcooked,  and the burger was lacking flavor. The barbeque sauce was tangy and the fry sauce resembled ketchup and mayo.   On the positive side, the place was well decorated,  clean\n And the staff was friendly!! Sorry, we probably won't be coming back tho..."
0,"Just got back from our Las Vegas Christmas vacay.  \n\nFirst I've always enjoyed the casino at Fremont...I have my favorite machines there so that in itself is enough to keep visiting, however staying at Fremont might be something that I'd need to consider.  \n\nOur toilet overflowed on our second night - not as gross as it sounds...it wasn't what you think it was...lol...water was was all over the bathroom floor and spilled over onto the rug.  I called guest services and it took a good 20 minutes for someone to come up...he plunged it and said that we need to flush twice.  He then sent a maid up that cleaned the floor with the existing towels in the bathroom with her gloved hands...then came back to give us more \""fresh\"" towels with the same gloved hands.  Just thought that it was unsanitary that she didn't clean the floor with any kind of soap or disinfectant being that it was toilet water....and that she used the same hands that I'm sure touched toilet water...to replace our towels.\n\nThe elevators weren't working properly so it would stop on the same floor and the doors would open and close.  It would take a good 5 minutes to get down to the lobby.\n\nIf you're a germiphobe this place probably isn't the right place for you but hey you're not going to Vegas to sleep right..."
1,"The Grand has been updated very nice. I had originally passed this hotel as a destination point, only because in the past this wouldn't be a hotel or area that was good, even being 1 block off of the main attraction area of freemont...... \n\nI read several reviews and decided to try it. I wanted something close to freemont. I booked with only two\ndays before my trip arriving on a Saturday. The room rate was $95.00 plus tax plus resort fees for a total of $127.00.\n\nThe hotel was very nice and busy but not packed, it was comfortable . The room was nicely decorated and CLEAN! The furnishings were new, not beat up and I really must stress this room was furnished nicely. Nice comfortable King size bed and the bathroom was CLEAN and udated to match the room. Carpet was new and clean and no spots or stains.....no smell of cigarettes! \n\nThe hotel gaming area was very nice and updated and the hotel center bar was nice with table electronic Keno etc. The staff was polite and personable and funny. NO SMELL OF NASTY CIGARETTE SMOKE, GOOD VENTILATION! \n\nThe Hotel has really come along way from years past. The only thing that they haven't done is updated the parking structure which is detached and across the street. There is a very very small elevator which was absolutely a disgusting mess and very dirty, dated and smelled pretty awful. \n\n The parking levels were littered with trash as well as empty beer cans, bottles & food stuffs, jus filthy!  I really didn't want my nice car parked at this location, it was like another world compared to the hotel. They do offer valet service but I didn't want anyone driving my vehicle, and I'm pretty sure they don't park valet parked cars across the street in this parking structure.\n\nNot one time did I see security in the parking structure and checked on my car several times in 24 hours that it was parked. A lot of questionable people lurking around the parking structure both on the street level and various levels in the structure,  it really needs attention with visible security!!  \n\nThe hotel did in fact validate my parking ticket and it was free. Upon attempting  to leave the parking garage and using my validated parking ticket the self service automated  machine attempted to charge me, I think 12 bucks or more and wouldn't lift the parking control arm, there is no person working the booth. So basically it's  holding you and  your car hostage waiting for payment...I reinserted my validated ticket several times and the machine finally released me from its clutches and the control arm lifted so I could escape without being strong armed into paying by use of my credit card, which would of been the only way to pay I guess, can't remember if there was a money slot for payment.\n\nBottom line is it just didn't feel safe in the parking garage and that's to bad they forgot about this portion of the hotel..... I won't park there again!! I'm not sure where I would park and I would need to further investigate other possibilities , simply put without a safe and clean parking garage this could keep me from staying at this great hotel in the future.\n\nThe garage filled up on Sarurday nite and it was very packed with cars.\n\nThe walking distance to the hotel is just across the street from the parking structure and to freemont street was easy and fast using a pedestrian corridor that was well lighted.\n\nCan't beat the location  and hotel but beware of that parking structure ......\n\nCheck in was very slow (300 pm / 330 pm  Saturday) with only two reps working the counter but check out was quick with 4 or 5 reps at 11am on Sunday morning.  All of the charges matched my quoted confirmed booking........\n\nIf that parking structure  and elevator gets attention with a good steam cleaning and daily maintenance along with visible security this hotel would deserve a five star plus rating.\n\nMy wife brought some to go food to our room from one of the hotel's restaurants at 230am and it was absolutely great, hot and fresh with no issues, eggs , potatoes and sausage with pancakes syrup and whipped butter and a club sandwich that was delicious.\n\nThere you have it.......\nBe mindful of your surroundings if you choose to use the parking structure.\n\nThat's it!!......"
1,"The best burger joint in the whole country, I ordered the damnation chicken burger with chocolate smoothie, I did not have any burger taste in my mouth like that. the Parmesan truffle fries. it is pricey but it's worth it. I tried Jack in the Box and Sonic but nothing like Gordon Ramsay burger. his a tip for two people to order your own burger and drink and share order of fries."
0,"I'm never stepping foot in this place again.  Service is generally slow, but waiting 30 minutes for food was a bit excessive.  To top it off our server was not friendly, and he admittedly forgot to ring in a drink I ordered in the beginning.  Our food came out cold, my burger wasn't cooked at the right temperature, and the pasta we ordered needed a heavy hand of salt.\n\nOverpriced, mediocre food, with crap service- not even worth it.\n\nThis place should stick to being desserts only."
0,"This sushi was DISGUSTING. The service was horrible and everything I tried  tasted like charcoal: burnt. Sushi isn't just deep fried and full of cream cheese. They even overcharged my card by $10!!\n\nNEVER coming here again! IF I could give them no stars, I would."
1,"Somehow I missed reviewing this place after going there every night for a week.  I'm a pretty big fan of this place, only because it seems like the only real alternative option to my favorite bar The Griffin.  Commonwealth is great but has a line a lot, and Downtown Cocktail Room is also great but is usually empty.  I don't care for the other bars on the block.\n\nPark is great because there's 3 distinct areas that each have their own vibe... the front patio, where you can chill and people watch, and it's awesome if the weather is good.  Inside the bar it's just your run of the mill bar, but has it's own style of exposed wood and stuffed animals (not what you think).  And then out back is this huge backyard playground that if you wandered in off the street you'd never find.\n\nThe bartenders I've dealt with here have all been pretty damn friendly, and that goes a long way to my bar selection.  Add a good beer list and not too expensive prices and you've got a winner in my book."
0,"One very, very blurry night a few months ago, I was showing an out of town friend around the Strip.  He wanted to go to a buffet in a bad way.  We were right by Harrah's, so against my better judgement, that's where we ended up.  Let's just say $22 a head was outragious for what was offered.\n\nFirst, I was hungry.  Second, I wasn't expecting much, but thought I could eat just about everything.  Nothing looked appetizing to me, even through my beer goggles.  Everything looked old, the place was kind of depressing.  I wouldn't think anyone would really consider ending up here, but if for some reason you are - please think again.  There are better, cheaper buffets in town, I promise."
0,"This place has the potential for 5 stars but not as is today!!! We live 5 min away and after reading the reviews we were soo exited to try a place where we could became regulars, we walked in and the place looks super cozy and nice , here is one star!! The music was amazing , there was live music and was really great!!! That is my other star!!! The service was the worst I had n a long time, the waitress was careless , never checked on us, plates were Piling on our table, my husband got a bacon cheese burger, she forgot the bacon and didn't even said sorry, the burger was aww , nothing great , we had fried calamari , was blend and we didn't even get a wedge of lemon they advertised is served with on the menu!! But it was so hard to get attention from the waitress we were done before she came back. I had the chicken Parmesan , and for what I read on the other reviews I was expecting it to be good, pasta was overcooked , chicken was soggy and took me 10 min to get the waitress to bring me Parmesan cheese, and when she did she slammed it on the table like she was angry she had to go grate it or something!!! And last of all, the garlic knots sucked!!!! They brought 4 out for a table of 3 and they where ok, a little heavy but fresh, we asked for some more and I think they were from the day before reheated, it was steal . Well all I have to said is I won't be a regular here, and they need some management checking on the staff because service was terrible!!!"
0,"Stopped here for breakfast one morning during our recent stay in Vegas.  Food was average as were portions,  decent enough but nothing special.  Wait staff was ok,  nothing special.  Doubt I would repeat going here again.  Breakfast for four was @ 65.00."

0,"I love Shabu Shabu, and have been going to the Shabu Shabu in Henderson (I won't name to be fair) for a long time. We decided to try this place, Swish, to get something a little different. In the end, we were extremely disappointed and wish we could recommend it, but just can not. \n\nDecor and ambiance are OK. Waitress was nice. Peach tea was good. Prices fair.\n\nThe major problem was the food. We ordered chicken and beef with shabu shabu and sukiyaki. Firstly, the sukiyaki and dipping sauces were way too salty and just not appealingly flavored. Secondly, the chicken was in chunks, not sliced, and had all sorts of cartilage and chewy bits. The chunks wouldn't cook because they were too thick.. The chicken was completely inappropriate and also tasted bad because it was served marinated in some sort of sauce that neither of us liked. I just couldn't eat the chicken at all. My companion ate it just so we wouldn't waste it, but he didn't like it either. The beef was ok, and sliced appropriately, and I ate that in the shabu shabu, but without a good dipping sauce was ultimately just disappointing. I like cabbage, but they served way too much of it and not nearly enough of the other vegetables or tofu or noodles.\n\nThe minor problem was the hot pots. They were extremely shallow, and the waitress didn't pay attention to them, so they were constantly boiling down, and at multiple points were down to almost nothing, so we couldn't cook our food.\n\nI left hungry, and sad."
1,"The food here was amazing. The atmosphere was good but for the price it could've been a little better, the tables were a little too close and the restaurant was pretty loud, definitely hard to have a conversation with the person sitting right across from you at the same table. But the positive is the food was great, the steaks are huge and cooked perfectly how I ordered it. And it's also great that you can make reservations online and through Yelp! I highly recommend this restaurant to anybody who's gonna be passing or staying in Vegas. Next time and every time I go to Vegas this will be a restaurant I will be going to every time."
1,"Discovered this place today as I was trying to find a new place to try for lunch. I was looking for a healthy place to eat and hit the jackpot! Salad creations has a lot of creatively made salads of their own, and you can also create your own as well! They also have some wrap options, soup, and dessert. The service is real quick and organized. As soon as you walk in, you're already standing in line, and the staff greet you with a friendly smile and ask how they can help. The good thing about being in line quickly is you get served quick, but the only thing I would like to see is more menu options. \nOverall, great place, I do plan on trying their other salads and creating my own too. They have so many great and healthy toppings!!"
0,"The steak was burnt on the edges, the salad lacked freshness and the baked potatoe was a little salty. The service wasn't too bad."
1,"I love this place, a stand-by for happy hours.  The beer selection is amazing and the food is top-notch for bar grub.\n\nComing here with a group and knowing a little bit about beer is gonna get you points with any crowd.  Want a nutty brown ale, you got Moose Drool.  Not a beer fan?  Recommend the Lindeman's Framboise.  Want to class it up with a Belgian?  They got everything from Chimay to Gulden Draak.  Beer to impress.\n\nFor food, I would recommend the Bernaise Sliders.  Nice rib-sticking bar food that anybody can enjoy.  Will be back frequently!"
1,"Cheap cheap cheap!!! Less than $10/person for lunch. They have sushi and it's quite good so instead of KAYA or Sushimom which is like $20/person, this is much cheaper and still delicious. Chinese food is top. Tons of seafood and yummy deserts. Nothing bad to say. Satisfy numerous cravings at once!"
0,"As a bit of a chili head, I have to say that I was very very excited about the atomic wing challenge here. Unfortunately, when we arrived we were informed that no such challenge existed anymore but they still have the wings. My coworkers and I excitedly ordered a round of the atomic wings and the wait began.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, the surroundings finally started to set in. I had noticed a bit of an odor when we arrived but hadn't paid it much mind. As it increased in intensity, I didn't have much of a choice anymore. Apparently, lunchtime is the ideal time of day to pump the raw sewage out and it just happened to run right through the door right in front of me. Not a good start.\n\nThe food finally arrives. This is going to be what makes it all worth it. I smell my wings and there is a little bit of noticeable tang and a some jalapenos on top. I take a bite nervously. Sort of cold. No noticeable spice. At all. Soupy wing sauce that doesn't taste very good on top of wings that I'm pretty sure just came from the grocer's freezer and found their way into Sport Pepper's microwave. Death knell.\n\nThe service wasn't bad but wasn't impressive either. Overall, between the dingy, dark decor, the overpowering smell of raw sewage, and the absolutely lackluster food, I just don't see myself ever being able to justify coming back.\n\nIt's unfortunate. I was really looking forward to this, too."
0,"First, I have to say I loved the atmosphere. This establishment was well put together. The only reason why I am giving it two stars. \nA couple of friends and I went here after having dinner down the street. I have seen this place and wanted to try it. So, I convinced my dinner companions to stop off for one last drink. It was before 9, and the doorman was extremely friendly and let me in even though I had on cargo shorts. We were met by a server (could have been the bartender) who I asked about seating. He lackadaisically told us we could sit in any of the unreserved booths. The only problem was it seemed like everywhere we looked there were reserved cards. So, I had to be persistent about getting a booth that was not reserved (only one table was available). He sighed and acted annoyed we were there and asked for his help. In fact, it seemed like he did not want us to bother him at all.\nWe sat down at a nice leather booth and waited for our waitress...and waited...and waited... Finally we asked another waitress to get our server. She finally showed up and was very nice. But, when I asked her about the drink menu she was hesitant to offer any choices and did not ask what I liked and did not offer any help. I saw an old fashion on the menu, a personal favorite, and ordered away. 15 minutes went by before we received out drinks. No lie here. We timed it after about 10 minutes passed. Our server did not deliver our drinks, nor did she come back and ask how they were. In fact, I did not see her the rest of the time we were there. We were there for over an hour. On a side note, I have had tasted some great old fashions before and this one was sub par. Nothing special for a $12.00 drink. So, I waited...and waited....and waited some more to order another drink. No one came by and asked if we wanted more drinks or even if our current drinks were good. So, one of my buddies had to go up to the bar to pay for our bill and we left. \nI can hear the syncs, what makes me qualified to write this review? Well my wife and I are foodies and enjoy fine dining. Also, I am a small retail owner who prides himself on customer service. I value Yelp as a tool to review my business and ask the same of others. I hope the owner of Mabel's on Main sees this and takes a hard look at their wait staff and if they want to keep their doors open."
0,I've been twice. Not a fan. That pretty much sums up my experience.
0,"First impressions begin on the phone.  I was new to the practice.  I had lots of questions.  The couple people I spoke with answered my questions and set the appointment.  3 stars for you!\n\nMy visit with the Doc was good.  She was very helpful and listened. 3 stars for you.  (I do not need to know about any personal cell calls you receive, this is my time with you.)\n\nThen I receive a phone call just minutes before closing from the office saying they had results for me.  I missed the call and responded immediately. Much disappointment when the answering service came on to say the office was closed for the day.  It is Friday. Most people want to know their test results. PLEASE do not call and then not allow us to call back the same day.  You might call patients at an earlier time giving them a chance to speak to you the same day.  Would you like to wait over the weekend for results?"
0,"Went with 4 friends, and we shared quite a bit so I got to try most of the menu. The biggest problem across the board was the service. All our questions about the menu were answered with terrible one word answers, so we ended up with many dishes that were nothing like we expected. Best example...when I asked, \""What is the 'Stuffed Guinea Fowl Supreme?\"" The first answer I got was, \""It's like a chicken.\"" My next question, \""But what is it stuffed with? And what does the 'Supreme' mean?\"" The response I got was simply, \""Dates\"". That was pretty much how all our conversations with the waitress went. But terrible service aside, the biggest disappointment was the food itself. Nothing was necessarily BAD, but nothing was particularly GOOD or memorable either. They also seem to love their foam machine a little too much. While making cucumber foam, or pea foam is interesting, the textural element was used as more of a novelty than a compliment, as it was used on half the dishes. The meal ended appropriately. When asked, \""What's the 'Death by Chocolate'?\"" The waitress responded, \""Mousse\"". Turned out it was chilled and closer to ice cream. Overall I would have given the meal itself closer to a 3, maybe even 3.5...but such horrible service is inexcusable. They also did not open our wine until we asked, and they placed the white in a bucket, but with NO ICE! Unbelievable...There are far too many good restaurants in Montreal, especially in this price range to waste your time here. Nice ambiance though, the interior designer gets 5/5."
1,"Don't be put off by the appearance.\nThe great little cash only restaurant has some of the best beans, rice and salsa I have had (I know that many will refute this).\nThe menu is what you would expect, tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc. all at a great price, as well as lunch and dinner specials that can't be beat.\nThere is only outside seating, on a make-shift patio.\nThere is the occasional loiterer who will ask for change or food, so it is best for take-out and to-go orders. But eating there is not bad.\nIt is right around the corner from me and part of my neighborhood. There are always people there, and having eaten there often, I know why. My only complaint is they are cash only."
0,"This restaurant looks nice. But that's just about it. The service is superbly slow, the prices are high for what is ostensibly sub par preparation of the menu items, which are quite limited (though they receive one star for plating presentation). The servers seem to try, but there are clearly the organizational issues which clearly mitigate them from performing as well as this place touts itself to be. Looks can be deceiving, and this place is a prime example of that."
1,"Please let me be clear: This review is for the CHOCOLATE; not the tour, cactus garden, or M&M monstrosity.\n\nI know a lot of people are underwhelmed with the \""tour\"" aspect, and I would have to agree. I have been here at LEAST 20 times in my life, and have seen the convener belts running only twice.  Once though I got to see people doing chocolate decoration which was really cool because it is something I try a hand at myself, and so it is nice to see someone else do it.\n\nThe chocolate, however, is another story.   Ohhhhh the chocolate.  I actually am a fan of the renovations that have been done in the last few years.  The new \""Lounge\"" area somehow reminds me of something out of the I Love Lucy era.  And it features this AMAZING chocolate blended drink that I am convinced is superior to EVERYTHING in the world.  Every time I go back and get it again, before I try it I am worried that I have built it up in my mind.  But no. It really is just that good.  \n\nThe chocolates are expensive, but they are ALL great. I have never gotten a dud here, even when I try something completely new.  They have a new line of liquor filled chocolates that are amazing.  I recommend the Lemon Drop and Cosmopolitan.\n\nAlso, if you haven't yet tried it, their Earl Grey chocolate is the BEST of its kind.\n\nThere are usually samples offered here, and honestly, if you are nice,you may be able to just ask for one.  It really depends on the time of day as to whether or not you get a sample freely, but when you do.....it is heaven. \n\nGo in, enjoy the air conditioning, buy a box of at LEAST 14 chocolates, and try the blended chocolate drink.   If you are just visiting The Vegas, it can be a nice break from the strip."
1,"I love this store. Not only are the owners and staff super nice and helpful, but they have a great product selection and the self wash is top notch. They use premium dog shampoos and conditioners, the tubs are huge and easy for our pooches to get into, and always so clean. I haven't had a chance to use their professional groomer, but all the dogs I have seen leave there have looked cute and happy. So glad a self wash is in our area."
0,"I am sad to say that it has really gone downhill. For lunch there is no prime rib, just roast beef. The sushi was obviously refrigerated with hard rice. One of my pork chile verde was still pink inside. The trout Proven\u00e7al had little flavor. However the dessert selection is great! So many different flavors of gelato! Therefore if you get the buffet of buffets ($45 with a player's card and they are enforcing a player's card for each person doing the buffet of buffets) it would be worth it to go for dessert but not the food."
0,"I just dont get what the big fascination with this place...\n\nIt's mediocre at best...\n\nI've had their beef hard shell tacos which are quiet greasy flavoress half the time.  Breakfast burrito was eh...would i go back willingly no, but if someone was buying me a free meal I couldnt go for it either."
0,"Food is good service is terrible. I phoned in an order for pick up 15min prior to showing up and the fries had not even been dropped yet, as I have a very limited amount of time for lunch as most people it did not leave time to even finish my food. I have not been to Rics in over a year because of prior service, but thought I would give them another try. Oh well, maybe I will try again next year."
0,I am only commenting on the brunch.  It's very pricey given the very limited selection and the quality mediocre at best.  The pastries are pre-packaged and the bacon is way over done.  It was actually burnt. Stay away for the brunch.  I can't speak for the other meals
0,"We made a reservation for 8:30pm on April 12th.  I figured it was good timing prior to our Jay Leno show at 10pm.  We were seated as we arrived.  The hostess wished us happy anniversary, which was nice of her.  Apparently it showed on their system when my husband made the reservation.\n\nWe had a nice table and our waiter seemed nice.  We were surprised that an Asian/Japanese fusion restaurant didn't have Plum Wine.  That's the most unusual thing I've ever heard of.\n\nWe ordered several small plates.  Grilled Asparagus, Chilean Sea Bass, Salad, Carpaccio, Salmon Sashimi and couple of rolls.  I made it clear that the rice portion of our meal will be from the sushi.  Everything came slowly and after waiting an hour for the sushi rolls, our waiter tells us it will be another 45 minutes.  REALLY!?  Are you kidding me?  I canceled the sushi order and left still hungry.  All the small meals that my husband and I shared were too small for any satisfaction to happen.\n\nTo think that it cost an arm and a leg to leave hungry...pretty ridiculous!\n\nBTW-the 2 stars are for the Asparagus and Sea Bass.  Everything else is worth NOTHING!\n\nHave not been this disappointed in a restaurant in a very long time.\n\nWill not be returning!"
0,"Sorry Howard, but gotta disagree with you on this place.  Well, okay partly disagree with you.  It is indeed very expensive.\n\nI came here for some late night eats.\n\nI split the following with the gf:  Hong Kong Won Ton (just okay), Shanghai Rice Cake (Shanghai cabbage with seasoned pork, wok-tossed in a mild soy sauce - the rice cakes were overcooked.  I like 'em much firmer), and Cantonese Sausage Fried Rice (With egg whites and thinly sliced Chinese broccoli stems - not bad).\n\nAdd in 2 very small chrysanthemum teas and you easily rack up $48 bucks and some change sans tip.  For that amount, you can feast.  \n\nNot worth it.  At least for me."
1,"A year ago this place would have gotten 5 stars, but it is not what it once was. That being said it is still very good for a buffet. I do miss the crab legs."
0,I don't get it. I ordered the chicken and waffles like everyone recommended but it was very tasteless and over cooked. Maybe I'll try it again. Just don't see it though. It was large enough for 2 people however. Maybe 3 since non of us cared for it.
0,"The day before I listed my car for sale, a rock smacked the windshield. I needed to get it fixed right and FAST so I could get it sold fast. I had seen all of the safelite commercials and their reputation, so I decided not to risk it and to take my vehicle directly to the main Safelite location to have the work done, so it would be done right. The customer service who I scheduled with on the phone and who met me at the shop was amazing. I left my car, got a ride back to my office and waited. Hours later, I called because it was three hours after they said it would be done and no one had called. Apparently, they forgot to call me. I got a ride back to Safelite and was met by a service technician. I was horrified by what I found. There was a huge gap all across the top of the windscreen. The rubber gasket was flipped UP and didn't seal anywhere. Looked like the entirely wrong kit (photo attached). I said \""woah...what happened? that's not right.\"" The guy started to argue with me. He said \""the national trainer is in today and he said it was the right trim kit.\"" \""I'm just a layman, dude, but even I can tell there is nothing right about this installation.\"" then he backpedaled further and tried to say my last windshield was installed wrong and it had caused damage...it was the factory window and was totally fine. I owned the car since new and it was the factory windshield with factory marks...I never had it replaced. I had an appointment to show the car that evening and was really irritated. I had to get a ride back to the office and leave the car to have it fixed. I got another ride back when they called to tell me it was done. It was better, but didn't look up to factory specs. I disclosed when I sold the car (Warranty doesn't transfer to the new owner). I wrote to Safelite about the experience (included the photo, names, dates, times, etc.) and they gave me the run around. The only saving grace is the nice guy that answers the phones and meets you up front."
1,"Ok, I know what you're thinking....\""Send Paul for drug testing...he gave a Walmart 5 Stars!\"" Well perhaps, but in my world, I rate things using the concept of RELATIVISM. Call me an Einstein junkie.....but, COMPARED TO OTHER LOCAL WALMARTS, THIS ONE IS 5 STARS. Get it now?\n\nIt's clean, well organized (for a Walmart), and I just don't feel that a drug deal will be going down in the parking lot anytime soon when I'm here. \n\nSo IF you have to go to a Walmart, check this one out. Note that I have NOT been to some of the Walmarts up North (Huntersville, etc.) but this is in comparison to everything West, East and South of Uptown."
1,"First, thanks to the offer of AZ restaurant week, $40 for a 4-course meal, I left happily! Second, it could be a bad-luck day that you just wont have food that's as good as your guest on the same table! Last, I'll share what I had!\n\n1. Japanese congee with Japanese Ginger and veggie - a light rice soup-ish dish, a little sour taste from the ginger, just enough to boost your taste buds to keep indulging it!\n\n2. Halibut cheek with greek yogurt sauce and a pesto looking (?) puree - very pretty plate and the fish was nicely done with a light taste, though I wasnt so sure if the two sauces complimented the fish well...still trying to figure it out, hmmm\n\n3. Duck leg confit - the meat was well done, so soft that you don't need a knife to cut (think about the texture of a nicely cooked short ribs), yes, I liked it a lot, just be aware that it was cooked with skin on which adds the natural taste duck fat, but its so fatty that you would still see the extra fat on the skin.\n\n4. Peach shortcake for dessert! Locally grown and fully riped peaches was so good!! Much better than the last dessert I had at different pointe of view...\n\nWith three of us on the same table, all 12 different dishes, I have to say mine was the best! :p but this is the beauty of posh, be adventurous and be surprised, you never know what would arrive to you!"
0,"I've been having a hard time finding a vet that I felt like I could trust and was doing the best for my pets.  I received a recommendation from a friend for Augusta Ranch to help treat my dog's Valley Fever.  I was very pleased with their treatment and his quick recovery! However, I brought my 13 year old cat here to figure out what was causing him to constantly vomit.  Turned out he had diabetes and the vet wanted to prescribe him the most expensive (probably most effective) insulin that is on the market. I explained that I was not in the position to spend $200/month on insulin for a cat and asked for alternatives.  The vet did not want to prescribe any other insulin and the reception then told me that \""Maybe it's time my family and I enjoy the time we have left with him\""!!!!  After I collected my emotions I went to another vet for a second opinion.  They were more than willing to work with me regarding affordable insulin, and wouldn't you know it, my cat is now in remission, living a healthy life!  Needless to say, after I was told to basically watch my cat die, I will not be going back here!!"

1,"Bradbury's, nooooooooooooooo!\n\nUpon my arrival in Madison, I knew there was only one thing I wanted: Bradbury's coffee. It had been a year since I left, and I was excited to get one of those wonderful, wonderful pourovers.\n\nThis may not mean anything to the non-coffee snobs about there, but they've replaced the Hario v60 with a Kalita Wave (both methods of brewing coffee). \n\nService was friendly, if a little curt, and the coffee was painstakingly brewed in a few minutes. It's great seeing the baristas work their magic. \n\nThe coffee, though? Only very good, not great! I don't know if my evil, yuppie Brooklyn mind has ruined coffee for me, but it simply wasn't as good as I remember. Very good? Absolutely, but it lacked the quality necessary to make it 5 stars.\n\nIt's still near-excellent, and everyone should go there. But man, that slight drop in coffee quality..."
0,"This restaurant is the one that my husband and I disagree with the rating the most. He swears by this place. The atmosphere, the food, the service. He thinks it's all great. However, after being drug here a half a dozen times or so, I hate to say that I find nothing special about Harlow's. It is always very busy, but not in a busting, upbeat way. More like people running around frazzled and disjointed. The service is average. The waitstaff does their job, but they aren't overly friendly. The food is average to less than average quality. I always order breakfast items, so I can't comment on their lunch menu. However, in my experience at Harlow's, french toast is french toast. A muffin is a muffin. And that's it, really. The atmosphere is kind of dismal to me as well, but I have yet to put my finger on as to why it feels this way.\n\nI want to love this place, I really do, but Harlow's has yet to prove anything special to me. Perhaps I'll be back, but if I'm honest it would take quite a big change for me to catch onto the hype."
1,"short version: good food, great flavors, generous portions, and awful service. \n\nlong version:\nWe got 1 veggie combo + 1 fish with peppers and onions and everything was delicious. Also, despite us both having hearty appetites, it was enough to fill the both of us for 2 meals! We took home an entire large container that we ate for dinner the next day and the bill came out to less than $30 including tax + tip! Usually, we order an appetizer and 2 veggie combos at ethopian restaurants and finish everything so the portions are definitely larger than normal.\n\nOnly reason for 4 stars is the service which is pretty awful. First, they tried bringing us overpriced water bottles even though we never asked for it. Then, they started clearing our plates before we finished eating. Lastly, they didn't fill our waters and again took it away before we were done, without asking if we wanted a refill. Also, it took quite a while to get the bill despite us being the only table of customers there by the time we finished our meal.\n\nAll that said, I would definitely come for the food again...just don't expect great service and dont come if you're in a rush."
1,"@redrockcasino is definitely my favorite casino outside of the strip.\n\nBig and spacious. Classy and fabolous. Simple but beautiful are phrases that come to mine when I think of this casino. It lives up to it's name red rock because they have beautiful rock/stone architecture inside. Because it is simply decorated, it may not get all the raves and oohs and ahhs but it is beautiful in it's own way. I just like how big it is and how clean it is. Clean casinos are always nice!\n\nThey have plenty of restaurants here, a great buffet, a bowling alley and pretty huge movie theatre and a nightclub called Cherry.  (random note: Model Cindy Crawford's husband Rande Gerber owns Cherry).\n\nRed Rock is a resort for everyone. I just like walking around Red Rock because there seems to be something to do in every corner. Good food and enterntainment in a big, clean and simple casino - this place is a winner in my book."
1,"I just went to this buffet this last weekend and boy was it worth it! The buffet was around $15 per person for dinner which wasn't too bad compared to all the other buffets esp. on the strip. They served all kinds of food like: italian, mexican, u.s.a., mongolian, chinese, bbq and delicious desserts. I was pleased with the variety of food and service was great. It was so much better than the Bellagio buffet. I totally recommend this place!"
0,"Let me get this straight, I am a fair minded and reasonable adult, I don't go out of my way to purposely slam and talk down about a business unless they REALLY have it coming. 24 Hour Fitness had it coming.\n\nLong story short, I was a member at this Chandler location for a year and a half, and when I chose to cancel out of personal reasons and my displeasure with the club I went through the regular cancellation process. This process means walking in, sitting down, telling them you're done, and they release you and cancel your membership right? I thought so too. So there I am 4 months later really digging into the bank account that this membership was on, looking at my activity, and I have been charged every month since November. How can this be when I cancelled in person and had a staff member cancel my membership? \n\nAfter getting corporate on the phone, they tell me that not only am I STILL A MEMBER, they have no record of me cancelling or even making contact about it. I tell them my story and give them a very deserving earful. Finally, this call center worker tells me \""okay, we can get that cancelled right now and refund that money\"", you bet you will refund that money! You will do it right now!  $120 stolen from me over 4 months...And why? Because some employee working there, some front end sales guy, never actually cancelled my membership when I was sitting down with him asking to cancel it. He was smiling in my face as he lied to me about the membership being cancelled. Oh yeah, I'm sure he just \""forgot\"" to press a few buttons or sign a few forms. They know what they are doing, they will do anything to steal from you and find a loophole, hoping you're too stupid and blind to ever notice. Do yourself a favor, NEVER do business with 24 Hour Fitness, or any large gym for that matter. Work out at home, at the park, or at some tiny mom and pop business, these giant gym chains are thieves, plain and simple.\n\nLet me also mention this, last summer in 2012 the A/C broke in this gym, and it wasn't fixed...not once. They gave all the club members a bunch of heave-ho about \""oh, we're fixing it, we're working on it.\"" The A/C stayed broken all the way through November when I cancelled. The gym smelled like a bag of dirty socks and it was at least 90 degrees in there, talk about a bad environment to work out in.\n\nThis place is a disaster zone, I urge anyone who wants to keep their money to stay away. Plus the equipment is usually broken and they don't fix their A/C...put that together and you have a shabby place of business. 1 out of 5, and that is being GENEROUS."
0,"ok, can I give no stars? Given this is the ONLY place in and around the universities to sell clothing, I was stubborn and went back a couple of times to try to sell clothing.  All I got were snooty employees eyeing my clothing, and chucking what they don't want into a dusty, dirty corner.  Gross.  Also, what the do have to sell has gotten worse and worse.  Now its down to a few racks of grody sweaters, forever21 jeans (which they are charging essentially the same price as you get in the actual store) and one or two designer dresses for $130.  right.  yea. \n\nOh, and the owner? Ever speak to him? I've never been called \""sweetie\"" or \""Honey\"" or \""Little miss\"" so many times in my life by one person in 10mins.  Oh, and the snickering, the smug look...\n\nYea, forget it.  I'd rather donate all my clothes to Goodwill than have them go through it again.  Not worth it at all."
0,Zero stars for this place! My home was just broken into...along with two other apartments -that I know of so far...one tenant her second time today! Wish I would have read these reviews before moving in
1,"Alright so like most of my reviews it was my first time here. I got the Grilled Chicken Broken Rice I believe it was R5 on the menu. It was pretty good I'm not going to lie. But the rice was a little sweet. Because they give you fish sauce and I was just listening to my sister when she said to pour it on the rice and the chicken. Maybe next time I can put a little less on but it was definitely good. The chicken was also pretty good and if you like spicy things you should use the chili paste, in the rice and on the chicken. I will possibly come here again but I don't think it's worth the drive for me. It is good but not to die for."
0,"It's a crappy dive bar, the strippers need rhythm & dance lessons. I usually only come here if my friends from out of town insist on going here, I just can't stomach it anymore.  \n\n   Tried to go to Jitter's last night with some friends (Jitter's & Lucky's are both owned by the same miserable owner & have the same address), and was turned away at the door. We were told that  this was a \""members only party, by invitation only and a private party\"" and they refused to let us in.  I have been to Jitter's too many times to count, and have NEVER had a problem getting in. But last night was also the first time I didn't walk in with any of my white friends.  Those same white friends were actually in Jitter's WAITING for us, and they were NOT told the same excuse abt it being \""members only\"". They showed their ID, paid the cover and walked right in. So this was obvisiously a blatent example of racial discrimination.  They should be lucky that anybody even wanted to go into their hole-in-the-wall bar (that is literally the basement of some raggedy old house) underneath a bridge. It's not really my scene anyway because their is always too many underage-looking kids in their openly sniffing coke,  but I've had fun there only because it's the only thing left thats open & nobody is ready to go home yet.  \n\n  I wish there was a NEGATIVE star rating that I could give this place, soley based off the way that we were treated last night. Although, I shouldn't be surprised since I have had similar problems in going to Lucky's & they are owned by the same people.  No type of minorities are welcome at these spots, UNLESS you have some white friends with you...they WON'T let you in. Don't even waste your time."
1,"Loved this place, sat outside for drinks and pizza and it was great. Service as wonderful and food was impeccable. Will be going here again!"
0,"Nice hotel but bad service at Wicked Spoon buffet, very slow service unfriendly staff including line cooks floor staff, for the price service is really bad."
0,"I've been here 3 times, and each time we were told \""sorry, the kitchen's backed up\"" as an excuse for the slow and confused service. The first time, the fries and hot appetizers came out cold. The burgers are okay but not worth having to endure the frustration of dining here. \n\nIf you do end up here, get the cheeseburger and a shake. And good luck."
1,"I've been here three times now with nary a disappointment. Yes, there's a huge crowd and a long wait, but it's worth it. By far our favorite breakfast spot while in Vegas. They temper the wait with serving the very best bloody Mary's in the world in the waiting area. Pickled green bean in my drank? Yes please!\n\nPortions are enormous and perfect for taking half back to the hotel to eat later. Share a plate? Pffft, I think not. \n\nI've tried the salmon benedict and the salmon hash, and I think the hashes win over other stuff. I love their biscuits and the sage poking out of them is cute, but it makes the biscuit taste like sage so if you're not a huge fan you might want to ask for no sage in your biscuit. The homemade peach jam on the table is not as good as it sounds, and if you've ever had peach baby food, well then, there ya go. The biscuit is  more than fine without it, though.\n\nSuper delicious and worth navigating the Imperial Palace construction and the long wait."
1,"Cheryl did a 5 star job, the hookah on the other hand is not so great, one guy taking orders from 50 plus people. Other then that drinks and atmosphere is cracking"
1,"Let's be honest. Last Chance is not a place to take your date, your parents, or anyone else you're trying to show a good time. Yes, there are shoes and shirts strewn about - there are hundreds of pre-menopausal women clawing through the doors each day. No, the people there aren't always friendly - they're not trying to earn a tip from you...they're on a mission to clean up the 38,039 pairs of shoes and shirts left strewn about by said pre-menopausal women. Yes, there may be a line to the dressing room a dozen people long. Yes, there may be a checkout line 3 times longer than the dressing room line. *This isn't the place to linger with friends and admire the latest fashion - this is for die-hard bargain shoppers only.*\n\nAs far as the actual clothing goes, it's hit or miss. I've gone there many times without finding anything, but I've also left with $500 worth of clothing I paid less than $50 for. IMPORTANT: Carefully inspect everything before you buy it. Everything is sold as is, and there are no returns or exchanges - no exceptions.\n\nBest advice? Get in, and get out. Best times are weekday mornings, though the last time I came I unexpectedly timed it just right when I thought it would be awful. I came in the early evening on a weekday, around 5:00. I had to wait over 10 minutes for a dressing room (it would have been much longer if I hadn't taken the open changing area), but once I was out there was no checkout line. The store was packed full of people, but it seemed that everyone had just arrived and wasn't ready to check out yet. If you can avoid it, DO NOT WAIT UNTIL LAST CHANCE CLOSES TO LEAVE. They will not let you keep looking around once 9pm hits, and you may have to wait in the checkout line for 30 minutes while the dozens of people in the store are pushed together all at once.\n\nKnow that everything is hit or miss at Last Chance. Some people are friendly and helpful, and some are not. Sometimes the lines are horrible, and sometimes they're quick. Sometimes you'll find incredible deals on beautiful clothing, and sometimes you won't."
0,"I knew it was too good to be true...\n\nWe stopped-in for dinner tonight and, well, yeah - not so great.  The service was atrocious; 20+ minutes before we got our drinks (2 beers, 2 sake - both of which were incorrect when we received them, and he forgot one person's beer - we received 2 orders of sake and 1 beer).  Edamame arrived cold.\n\nSushi was definitely not fresh, and I'm feeling less than stellar after having returned home from Takara.  I know the 'ole gut isn't a-rumblin' from anything else, as this was my only meal for the day...  I have a feeling I'm in for a loooong evening.  :-(\n\n$126 for a few specialty rolls, 3 brews, sake, a hibachi order, and terrible service.  It literally took us 3 hours to eat dinner - we rarely saw our server.  We checked-in at 6:15pm and I just got home now (it's 9:30pm).  After he dropped-off our checks, we sat for nearly an hour before he picked-up the cards - no exaggeration.\n\nI think this was my last visit to Takara. Sorry for my previous 4-star review..."
1,EAT the chips and salsa!!!  You will not be disappointed!  \n\nChicken enchiladas are A-MA-ZING!  \n\nGreat patio!
0,"Went in there with high expectations, Neil Brown \""Who wants to be your jeweler!\"" never even came out of his hole in the back.  This place is over priced and will rip you off, also if you want to sell jewelry.  Don't go here!!!"
1,Just had a great lunch. Owners were super friendly giving suggestions and chatting. Nice patio with real BBQ.
0,"Brand new, but lacking luster.  \n\nThe descriptions on the menu belie the actual appetizers and entrees.  This \""gastropub\"" was suggested to me for happy hour by a colleague.  At first appearances the menu suggests interesting twists on standard pub fair, but don't be fooled.  I ordered the \""dewedged\"" salad that claims pancetta as an ingredient.  What actually appeared on my plate was cold chewy bacon bits.  The consensus at the table was that the food fell far short of what was touted by the waitress as being made predominantly in-house.\n\nThere's a caveat to the $2 can Tuesday happy hour: It only applies to beers $4.50 and under.  Sadly, the beer selection is limited generally.  The beer selection priced at $4.50 and under forces you to choose from run-of-the-mill beers like Red Stripe, Blue Moon, and Yuengling.\n\nI had a better experience at Industry Public House in Lawrenceville."
1,Always good service and great food! I am a regular here and the staff are always so friendly.  I would definitely recommend this place.
0,"I used to love it here. Then, came the the \""temperamental\"" machine on visit three, that had seen too many customers and wasn't working well during my visit at the end of the day, (but the payment system was working just fine). And then came the visit when I was charged for a \""full\"" service but I only got a two second laser zap touch-up, and to my face I was told it was done... like I can't feel it... Then there was yesterday's visit, my last visit. First of all, it took two weeks to get in because the woman scheduling couldn't get it right. When I received my first appointment call confirmation for the wrong day, I let the receptionist know that there was a mix up, she said, \""Well, we're gonna have to ch...\"" I interrupted, having read the paperwork, I remember they charge for missing appointments and I said, \""You shouldn't charge me for this appointment, since it wasn't my mix-up.\"" The receptionist cleared her throat, said, \""Okay, well, let's try to fix this.\"" So, good I thought. Until the next week she called to confirm the wrong day again. I expressed I was getting frustrated, first getting charged for a full treatment when not receiving it and then the two-weeks of ill scheduling. After I arrived for my appointment yesterday, my 17 year old daughter with me, and my witness, the owner not only wouldn't make eye contact with me, but then called us into the room, where she was extremely rude. \""I hear you have a problem. What's going on?\"" Thinking maybe her tone is just nervousness, I proceed to tell her, she puts her hand up to motion for me to wait a minute and then calls the receptionist in. They stood near the door, squaring off, telling me they would never say they would charge for an appointment, she slipped up saying we screwed up our scheduling and then proceeded to tell me she can re-do the treatment that I was charged for at no-charge but, she says, it sounds like nothing will satisfy me, her voice getting louder and more angry as she talked, not letting me finish mind you. She blew the whole thing out of proportion and grossly mishandled it. My daughter and I will never go back. This morning, I have scabs on my face from how high the laser was after she was angry at me for addressing a situation. \nThis woman rushes through her clients, each time we've been there a client says, \""Oh, well, looks like you missed a spot...\"" EVERY TIME. I will never go back. Nobody should be treated people like this."
1,My experience with Aimee Bar Am Photography was a pleasure! My daughter was fussy and not in the mood for a photo shoot but Aimee managed to capture her adorable happy side.  The pictures I got were great and i get many compliments  from the people around me. will defently use Aimee agin for all my Photography needs.
1,"Even a NYer was telling me to get tacos here, so I did. Pretty good. Loaded more than I'm used to. They make their own tortillas which is respectable. It's fun to watch people order tacos here, this is a real taste of Mexico, and it seemed new to half of them. Pittsburgh is a great town because the vendors aren't afraid to give the people something real - they even have tongue. \n\nThat chinese food truck across the street though.... it's good, but way Americanized."
0,"Now I know why this was featured on every travel site about Pittsburgh. It's what is known in the trade as \""tourist trap.\"" Surely Pittsburgh could have come up with a more original way to showcase its riverfront and the Clinton Furnace than importing Chicago's chains: Joe's Crab Shack, Bar Louie, Houlihan's. The only local restaurants were, unfortunately, closed during our visit, so we were forced to eat at the Hard Rock Cafe. What could we do? There was nothing around for at least a mile after we took the inclines. My children enjoyed the fountain, but I couldn't wait to leave."
1,"This was recommended by a friend to try when we visited Las Vegas, and she did not steer us wrong. Best tasting broth (I had the Tonkotsu) and noodles ever!  And the pork slices just melted in your mouth.  Wow!  Delicious!!  What a memorable lunch.  Unless you don't  mind waiting, I would recommend not going at noon as we did because there was a line out the door to be seated. Once the crowd cleared out and we were seated, it didn't take much time to get our food.  We'll be back on our next visit!"
1,Decided to try this place for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised! I got a chicken teriyaki vegetable bowl and half a California roll. More food than I needed but I wanted to try the sushi. The chicken teriyaki is delicious! The sushi is pretty good considering that this is fast food. The service was great my order was up fast. I will definitely be back!
0,"After a positive experience with Dr. Davis and his office, I brought my expensive Calvin Klein sunglasses in to get a new set of lenses. When I got them back, the lenses didn't seem right. I asked the optician to look at them and she did something with the right arm and she broke it! Her attitude was, you signed a release and your screwed! We're not responsible even though the glasses broke when she was working with them. I was very upset with the lack of s caring attitude and hiding behind a release form. I am left with the opinion that once they get their money from VSP, game over. I had to take my broken sunglasses to a frame repair place and pay $65 cash to get them fixed. VSP did reimburse the $65 to me because they do care about their customers, unlike Dr. Davis and his staff. The take away from this experience is that Dr. Davis is a good eye doctor but his business practices leave a bit to be desired! Definitely do not use his office to get new lenses on your exiting frames. He will not stand by them if anything happens! Unfortunately in today's world, good customer service is hard to find. It's all about the $$$ and not the customer."
1,"I've only ever been here for happy hour on a week day, so I can only comment on my experience at the bar. Even on a week day, there was a 30+ minute wait for a table, however, we were perfectly fine scoring two seats at the bar. We ordered drinks and were able to order some \""saucy balls\"" as an appetizer. \nThe vibe at the bar has a very luxurious feel, and the drink menu is extensive. Lots of after-work, happy hour people. I also only was able to stay at the bar on the bottom level, I did not venture to the upstairs. \nFor the happy hour crowd, I would say the bar was a little understaffed. I am not sure if there was an event going on that time, or if they are usually this busy on a week night, but they could have used at least one more person behind the bar.\nI thought the food was delicious and quick to come out.\nI also ordered the cheese and olive plate, which was perfect with my cab sauv.\nHighly recommend for after-work dinner or drinks!"
0,"Ate here yesterday and did not have a good experience. It took quite a while for a server to greet us, but the nice hostess finally realized. Apparently our server knew she was giving us bad service the whole time and waited until the end of the meal to apologize for the \""bad service\"" because she \""just got caught off guard.\"" I'm not sure what she got caught off guard by, the table clearly in her section? I think it was just that she was talking to people at the table right next to us, which we could clearly see. She could've owned up to why she gave poor service, given that we could see exactly why. The food itself was just okay. The food is overpriced for the portion size. I got the sliders and one of them was a tiny piece of chicken and mostly bread, which is obviously saying a lot that it was small since sliders are already small. I won't come back."
0,"If I were to rate *only* the food then I would have given a 5-star rating since I find the food really good. But its not only the food that makes you come back or appreciate a place.\n\nThe service of this place is very poor. I believe the servers should be given some training on how to interact with guests, how to behave with them, how to serve them. But no, the owner doesn't care about it. It happens with me all the time, the servers \""hands-me\"" the plates, bowls, curries, breads everytime without fail, insteading of keeping it on the table even when I am in the middle of my meal. \n\nAnd the most irritating thing, they always ask you to pay while you are eating. ALWAYS! Why can't they wait for me to finish and then let me ask for the cheque or if it can't be avoided, why can't they be courteous while asking for it. Last time when I went there, the same thing happened and instead of complying, I complained, asked the server that I wanted to speak to the manager. This really spoils *the* experience for me.\n\nI keep going back to this place since it is walking distance from my place, but after the last time, never going back!"
0,"One of the first Indian restaurants I have ever eaten at. Actually I think it might of been the first. I don't know if that disqualifies me from being a half decent critic. But I have eaten tonnes of Indian food since, and this place just didn't cut it. The food was bland, uninspired, and presented in a sloppy fashion. Granted it is Indian food, but I believe that Indian unfairly gets a bad rap for being mishmash food. I think this place gets away with serving sub par Indian food, I do not recommend it."
0,"Very bad experiences not only with the customer services also with the foods that I ordered.\n\nFirst of all, my broken rice dish with bbq pork and pork skin was very bad.  The rice was half cook.  Meaning, I was chewing into a crispy rice or something.   Pork skin tasted and smelled like something that been lft outside for a lomg time and ready to be rotten.  BBQ pork is little burn, which is acceptable, but it was salty like hell.  We also order egg rolls as an appetizer and Pho Special.  Egg rolls were plain and not to our liking.  Pho noodles were bad, soup was not to the correct medium and tasted rather sweet than pther Pho restaurant.   \n\nWe asked for cook bean sprout.  It never came.  We asked again and saw no sign.\n\nWe asked for extra napkins and folks, an older asian waiter nodded his head and then again, we see no signs of our simple requests.  The restaurant was half empty and we were there on 8.11.13 at 815pm!  Either the staff members were tired or they simply telling customers not to come and eat there again.\n\nI also did order my three colors dessert but never came to our table.\n\nLast thing really blew me away was that,  the three colors dessert was on our check.  We refused to pay since we never received it.  \n\nBeing a good and responsible customer, we paid our chk and include our 15% tips.  We can imagine how hard it was to work in a restaurant.   So, we still paid our tips regardless of the bad services and low quality foods.   That was our last and only time we go here to dine.\n\nEATers beware!   If you come here, expect a bad service experience and low quality food.  Prices were at a higher scale.   Environment is average."
1,I have to say the only reason I am giving this place 4 stars is because of one of the delivery drivers that work here. I still don't know his name but I will update it when I find out because I've never had a delivery guy that is as friendly and helpful as this guy. I enjoy the mild hot wings and cinnamon sticks here and order them a lot. The driver knew my name after a couple of times and always gives me coupons and info on the best deals so I can save money. I thought that was very nice of him and he deserves to be recognized for going above his job to make his customers happy.

0,"An open letter to Primp & Blow: I am a real customer. Writing a real review. Stop accusing your competitors of writing nasty reviews, pay attention to what your customers are saying and fix your business. That's how it works.\n\nMy experience at your shop was just all wrong from the moment I arrived--so much so, that even my 12 year old niece, who was also getting a blow out, realized it. We compared notes and here is our honest, genuine review of Primp & Blow. \n\nThe okay: Open on Sundays, decent location, no wait when we were there, Bumble & Bumble product.\n\nThe bad: The stylists were ditzy, unprofessional and lackluster in general. The girl doing my hair actually stopped what she was doing to read over the iPad over my shoulder so many times that I stopped reading and switched to entertaining myself on my phone. She also, while doing my hair flirted with a maintenance man across the salon and hit me in the head with a blow dryer. She loudly and, in an accusatory tone, commented on any flaws in my cut or hair quality but drew a blank when I asked her for suggestions. \n\nThe ugly: My blowout lasted a few hours. It was pretty--that's about it. I paid extra just to have the stylist touch a curling iron for my blowout and my niece's so I did feel completely stilted. To my knowledge, this is the only blowout bar that charges extra for hot tools. The stylist didn't use any product pre-blowout and it showed. Checkout took forever. It was during that time that the woman working the front desk told me her suspicions about a competitor writing reviews on Yelp. \n\nThe bottom line: I've been to plenty of blow dry salons in the valley--this was by the far the worst. All show, no substance. Nice space, good location, lack of talent.\n\nCatherine Thomas"
1,I have stayed in this hotel a few times. I think overall it's good. I am happy with the golf view. The restaurant is alright.\n\nUpdate 9/7/07 - I stayed over at this Hotel again....really great customer service!
0,"Quite the adventure.  I had bought a Living Social and Gavin did my hair.  It came out fine (cut, color, and blow out) and since then I have been back three times.  The last time I went, I had an appointment and when I walked in, Gavin was working on someone else.  I waited twenty five minutes before it was my time to get my hair cut and colored.  Not even a sorry I am running late.  Two weeks ago I booked with Gavin for 9:00.  The day before my appointment I got a voicemail asking if I could come at 11:30.  When I called back I said I would change my appointment for then.  I was then asked if I could make it at 12:00.  I said yes.  Got there today and Gavin was NOT there.  First I was told he was out getting supplies, and then after 15 minutes I told Frank, the owner, that I was not going to wait anymore and leave.  He then told me that Gavin was on his way and had gone for therapy.  So which is it?  Supply store or therapy.  In any case, as I was walking out, Gavin showed up 20 minutes late.  I usually don't write bad reviews but I just wanted to warn others as this has got to be the most exasperated I have ever been at a hairdresser."
1,"I've been riding on Mallard/Clarks Creek Greenway for several months now. I'm new to cycling and figured that this would be a good learning point before dealing with traffic on the open road. Plus it's one of the only Greenways in this area that is longer than 2 miles one way. \nThe paved section is around 10miles (out and back) so you can get a decent \""newbie\"" ride. I like and don't like how it winds behind housing developments. It's nice to see what the Jones' are up to but also kind of creepy thinking that you may be watched. The route is a good workout with some small, slight climbs and turns. Parts of it is uphill a little bit (mostly heading back from Saxonbury way). There is a lot of activity during the warmer days. Plenty of dog walkers and other fellow bikers. \nParking at the Elementary School can be limited, especially if going around 2 o'clock and the uphill climb is brutal when you are returning to your car. There is also parking along Saxonbury way which is very accessible and if you're eager for more, then you can ride throughout the neighborhood too. \nThe trail is decently maintained but I think that may have to do with the budget cuts in Charlotte. You will definitely find better maintained Greenways in the counties north of Charlotte (i.e. Davidson and Cabarrus). The main issue with this is dodging sticks and debris after a storm the night before and also navigating across the bridges. I'm afraid of losing a tire over some of them with their gnarly, knotty wood. It would be nice if they had water fountains and Doggie Depots along the greenway but I may just be spoiled from Cabarrus County. \nYou can easily make this a 12miler by adding the University Research trail and the Kirk Farm Fields trail. I will say that if you have a Road bike then it may be an uncomfortable and unstable ride through the research park as it's loose gravel/rock. However, if you are on a Hybrid bike or MB then you will do just fine. I particularly love the Research trail route for the scenery along the creek. It reminds me of a winding forrest trail in the mountains."
1,"went here for dinner a few weeks ago and again for lunch this weekend.\n\ndinner has crab legs, sushi, oysters (all not my gig), and several shrimp and fish entrees.  the shrimp entrees were great!!  soooooo yummy!  the chicken and beef entrees were also really good. the service was a little slow and the iced tea was a bit watered down, but for the quality of the food and price you can't beat it.  \n\nlunch also has oysters, sushi, shrimp and fish.  the lobster shrimp was good, as were the chicken entrees.  not too many beef offerings for this lunch.  the ice tea was better (not great) and service was on the spot!  she flew in each time a plate was finished, even thought the place was fairly busy!  and lunch for 3 ppl including tax and drinks for under $30 is a bargain."
1,"We recently purchased a new home, and consequently, needed a lot of lamps.  We'd driven by this store many times without really paying much attention to it until now.  Upon going in, we realized that their prices are a bit higher.... if you're looking for just a lamp to get by, Home Depot or Target will probably do the job.  But for something that will last and is more of a quality, eye-catching addition to the room, Lamps Plus is the route to go. \n\nEvery time we've been in, the salespeople have been helpful and friendly.  One of the many (10+) lamps we bought was defective and couldn't be assembled.  I brought it back the next day (with the receipt) and had no problems exchanging it.  No problems to speak of on our end."
1,"Dear Gordon f*cking Ramsay, Esq.\n\nDude, you need to chill.  You have like 275 shows on TV, most of which consist of you screaming your balls off at some poor sap because \""the soup was dry\"".  I only ever watch Master Chef, and that's because you dispense earnest, humanizing advice that gives the impression that somewhere deep inside, you still kind of give a sh*t, which your image desperately needs.  But seriously, Master Chef Junior?  What's next?  Master Chef 'n Da Hood?  Master Chef in Space?\n\nAnd no, I'm not brainstorming for you.\n\nAnyway, the point is, we get it, you're a \""brand\"", but we are so bombarded with your visage that it almost makes it seem like your place as culinary alpha-and-omega is maybe not arbitrary (no one can deny you are an accomplished chef) but seemingly self-appointed.  So, because of this, I went to BurGR (the only one of your Vegas restaurants I can consistently afford) with the firm predisposition to hate it.\n\nAnd based on the decor alone, at the beginning I totally did.  Your face is all over the damn place, your hostesses looked plucked out of a Hooters calendar, and the flames-and-metal decor is over-the-top and uninviting.  But, I have to say, once I sat my ass down and started stuffing my face, my mind changed quickly.  Been three times already, and it wasn't some kind of fluke.  The garden burger with the duck bacon and fried egg is as good a burger as I've ever had.  Definitely top three.  The fries with the fancy ketchup are absolutely delicious and the service was quick, effective and infallibly polite.\n\nI also have to give you kudos for keeping prices reasonable, at least comparatively speaking for a Vegas strip restaurant.  Fries are not included with the burgers but one order can easily feed two people, which is nice to know in advance.  You have an awesome beer selection and I was pleasantly surprised to see that for $6, I get a tall pilsner glass filled to the top.  The Innis & Gunn is a particularly awesome pairing with any of the burgers.\n\nAnyway, I still find you kind of odious, but food-wise, BurGR is firing on all cylinders, and ultimately that's what's important.\n\nThe water was a bit raw, though."
1,"Best spa experience I've ever had, without a doubt.  I've been to a dozen spas out here, but I've never seen any reason to write about any one of them. First off - best massage of my life. I've recently started training for a marathon, so the stretching included with the Signature massage was absolutely perfect. Not so much that I felt like I was exercising (that would defeat my purpose), but just enough to make my sore muscles melt. The facilities at the Montelucia are amazing. I really love the Moroccan theme - unique and vibrant, yet as serene as it should be. Everything is clean and new and it smells delicious.  I LOVE the idea of the \""whisper room\"" - a dimly lit space with loung-y beds, especially after a couple of pitchers of sangria out by the pool. I see Camelback Mountain everyday, yet the view from the terrace was breathtaking. My friend and I lounged outside for hours eating and sipping cocktails by the 85-degree heated pool. \n\nThe only drawback is that it ain't cheap, even with the \""local\"" discount. Even though my spa day cost me more than the monthly payment on my BMW, I can't wait to go back. Perhaps after I find a second job."
0,"While visiting my father who was admitted to St. Joseph, I had to get my Americano fix. The first day, I felt like the barista was irritated that I had asked if they had a canister of non-fat milk.\n\nThe second day I had brought a 2nd visit coupon from another location. The offer said $2.00 iced drink after 2PM, which sounded great. The same barista, the one with the mullet, was quick to point out the fine print \""Participating Locations Only\"" with a nasty attitude. When I told him that I didn't feel right buying full priced Starbucks drinks twice in a day, he rolled his eyes and said \""Oh well, YOUR LOSS!\""\n\nSo today, I made every effort to get my coffee elsewhere. I usually look for the non-corporate coffee shop, however, in this neighborhood it seems like the only options for quick espresso drinks in this area the Starbucks peppered all over the downtown area.\n\nThe staff here made me really appreciate the Starbucks by my house as well as all of those small independently owned shops that I really enjoy so much more.\nIf you must get your Starbucks and you are going to the St. Joe's, GET IT ON THE WAY, NOT HERE!"
0,I walked in Bebe nails just expecting a quick manicure maybe a short wait.  After waiting 30 minutes with no one acknowledging me another person walks in and is greeted right away. The person wanted the same thing as me a manicure. They sat them down in a chair an immediately got to work. At that point I was so pissed I just got up and walked out. Thanks for nothing bebe nails.
1,"Needed two Palo Verde trees thinned and trimmed.  Received a call back less than 24 hours after leaving a message.\n\nThe estimator showed up the following day, and presented a very fair estimate for the job.\n\nThe crew (Dave and Luis) showed up 2 days later to do the job.  I have to say they did an outstanding job.  Trees look great.  They were very knowledgeable and meticulous in their work.  They literally swept their way off of my property.\n\nHighly recommend!"
0,"Extremely disappointed. I'm totally letting the quality of the service I received outweigh the food. If you're in the mood for good food and you don't mind crappy customer service, then this place will suit you just right. \n\nI've been to sushi kaya many times in the past and wasn't always impressed with their customer service. The main reason I come back is for the decent pricing and good food. I even had my birthday dinner here last year. Their sushi selection is good and the AYCE menu has a variety of appetizers and tapas. I can't remember how much the lunch AYCE price is but dinner is ~$25 which is pretty competitive compared to other sushi joints around town. Aside from the food, their service totally got in the way and ruined my likes for this place. They're open until 3am but last call is at 2:15am. I opted not to get AYCE because we got there at 2am and 15 minutes was definitely not enough time for me to order a crap ton of food. I ended up getting stuff from their regular menu (kimchi fried rice $8.95 and four pieces of agedashi tofu $5.95) while a couple of my friends did AYCE. While my friends were ordering, the waiter kept interrupting them saying they were not allowed to share their food with myself and another friend since we were ordering stuff from the regular menu. We could tell he was not happy that they were doing AYCE right before closing time. It was just a huge disappointment. If you're gonna offer hours of service until a specific time, have the decency to honor and uphold it! They were pretty quick with bringing our food out but that's probably because we were the only guests there, aside from a couple that were seated a little before us. Near the end of our meal, they came by to ask how we were doing. My friends were missing a couple of their orders so they went to check. The waiter argued that we had received the orders already and defaulted the blame on the server, excusing her because she's still training. Regardless of the fact that she is new, he should not have argued with us. It was not professional by any means. We finished eating and continued to sit there to chit chat but noticed that it got extremely cold around 2:40ish. I'm not sure if they cranked up the a/c to get us out or if they just had a door open. We paid our bill and there was still 20 minutes left before closing time. We probably should have left right away since we knew they were closing but we were in the middle of a great conversation which was interrupted by the waiter. He came over to tell us that we had to leave because they were closing. I totally understand but it was very awkward. He didn't walk away from our table until we got up to leave. It's not like we were gonna camp out there all night.\n\nI wasn't happy walking out of there. I'll probably come back again but it will definitely not be my first choice."
0,"This review is only  on the customer service on reservation cancellations and management communications.\n\nCanceled a reservation for my boss and apparently they do not have the standard 48 hour requirement.  Theirs is 72 hours.  We were penalized one night's stay.  Fine.  \n\nTried to retrieve the invoice for the charge to complete an expense report and apparently this request is brain surgery.  I called and was connected to reservations and they sent me an invoice alright, for a charge for two room nights?  Not only that but the document was quite official which was impressive but the charge was for the base room price, no tax or any additional resort fees which tells me that it was a manually and carelessly generated invoice.  That was day one.\n\nCalled again and the reservations representative apologized and mentioned he would look into it and there went day two with no return call or follow through.  Before the end of my day which is 3pm, i called the hotel and asked to speak to a manager.  Until today, day three... no call back.\n\nAs mentioned, it's now day three.  I called the hotel myself and stayed on the phone until i got an actual manager on the phone.  Then she transferred me to accounts payable at which by this time I had repeated my story to THREE different people.  ANNOYING.\n\nFINALLY, Amelia Carr from Accounts Payable took the time to make sure I got what I needed.  \n\nREALLY???  three days for an invoice???  SHOOT ME NOW."
1,"I'm not sure why I love this IHOP so much. Maybe it's because I can order pancakes, a cheese omlette, cheesy-hash browns with bell peppers, bacon and toast and  it all tastes so damn good and is relatively cheap... although I just realized our waitress overcharged me by A LOT this morning. Grr.\n\nPretty solid experiences all around here. Go IHOP!"
0,"The owner's mom used to own a restaurant in central avenue, then she sold it to help out her daughter here. The pho at first is still as good as the old place, but now the quality and the quantity are both becoming worse and worse every time I come here. I would rather drive couple more miles down the road to Asian corner next time. Peace out pho real."
0,"Never again. I have to go to Avis because they're one of my company's \""preferred\"" vendors, but I'll have to make an exception next time. Service was mediocre. However, when I got to the car to my surprise it was a tiny little Chevy Aveo, which I imagine is an automobile only used for rentals, since no one in their right mind would purchase a vehicle like that. If that wasn't bad enough the car wasn't cleaned; filthy inside and out, the clock in the car was about 7 hours off, there was no power steering, and the navigation system kept on falling apart almost causing me to get in an accident every time I took a turn. I'd recommend any other car rental co over Avis."
1,"I totally enjoyed this place. Not the best area,but as always, looks can be deceiving. Ordered a snow cone, smoothie, and a fresh juice. My juice was on point. Pineapple, oranges, and strawberries. Delicious. Only snafu was when the guy at the counter forgot I had ordered it. So I waited, and waited, and waited. When I mentioned it he totally owned up, apologized profusely and even offered a freebie scoop of ice cream for his mistake. I love it when people take responsibility for their errors and move on. This kid blew me away. I also loved this fresh juice and will definitely be returning when in the area. Always glad to support small businesses."
1,"Always a great place, we visit Los Dos 1-2x everytime we are in Phoenix yearly. This time we gave the Mesa location a go, opposed to the original. Food and service were great as usual, however the food didnt seem as spicy as at the original Los Dos and the ambiance is not the same...has more of the standard restuarant look and feel. Not a knock at all...still amazing food regardless!!!"
1,"At the time of reservation we were told the resort fee is included but it was a different story at check in. Last time I was in Vegas was almost 10 years ago and a lot has changed since then. This hotel is really great place to stay for it's price. On an average not fight or big event night it runs around $200 a night for suits. The rooms are really nice with 3 TV's basically in each room. Mini Bar included witch is really pricy and I recommend taking your own drinks and ask for a refrigerator for $25 per night. \n\nThe hotel has a lot of nice restaurants and stores including a gift shop next to the Elevators which is really convenient if you need something really quick. I wasn't to much into gambling since I can't stand the cigaret smell in the casino, even they have crazy air cleaning system running 24/7. \n\nBouchon was my favorite Restaurant which is part of Plazo hotel next door in a short walking distance threw the hotel. It is an amazing french restaurant with great service and hospitality, and atmosphere."
1,"Had a short layover in PHX airport terminal A. didn't have enough time to sit at a bar. saw this place and decided to give it a try. i was in the mood for hot breakfast food, but my flight landed at 11am local time. Most of the nearby eateries stopped serving their breakfast food at 10am, so I thought I would have to just \""grab a burger and go\"".\n\nFound this place and saw the \""breakfast burger\"" on the menu. Got it with the all beef patty, with bacon, fried egg (over easy), tomato, lettuce, cheese and thousand island spread... hell yeah! Hot breakfast food! kindof.. but it hit the spot and it was really good. Did not skimp on the bacon and the mixture of runny egg and cheese gave the texture of a good hash (except with ground beef not corned beef). \n\nScarfed this sucker down so fast, I have time to write this review before boarding my connecting flight.\n\ndidn't order any fries, so can't comment on that. would have ordered hash if they had some, but didn't. this is more of a burger and hot dog joint, not a \""breakfast\"" place. But if you're feeling like some breakfast food, but every other eatery in terminal A says it's not the appropriate time for breakfast, take your business to modern burger and get your bacon/egg/cheese fix!\n\nAlso ordered coffee. pretty light and standard large volume drip. nothing to write about here. just filled up my thermos for the plane.\n\nAlright! Gotta board my flight, but if you're in the area and need a quick fix, this breakfast burger's da bomb!!!\n\nPrice is decent for Airport food. paid $7.50 for breakfast burger with beef and $2.25 for the coffee. Fast service. Great food. Won't miss your flight! Go Go Go!"
1,"I love this place. Their service is friendly and everything I've tried on the menu for the last 2.5 years has been great. The calamari appetizer, half price at happy hour, is the best calamari in the country. And my airline pilot husband and I have traveled and eaten out a whole lot in the last 30 years. Our college student son likes the food as well. The Asian fusion cuisine works. You'll love it."
0,"Distinctly tepid soup, an eclectic car-crash menu, and friendly but slow service. This is not the recipe for a happy lunchtime.\n\nOverall, we said: \""the Slug & Lettuce wasn't great. They absolutely, categorically need to chop their menu at least in half, if not further than that. They have eight different burger options, sitting next to a similar number of curry options, sitting next to a broad range of pasta options, and from what I could see, none of it looked too appetizing. They need to focus on a much smaller number of dishes, and try to inject some quality. For now, I couldn't recommend the place.\"""
0,I really wanted to like this place. I even prematurely took a menu because I thought I would be ordering dinner as take out from this place as everything looked super healthy in a biggest loser sort of way. I ordered the Antioxidant Salad (see photo) and it was AWFUL. The lettuce was fresh looking but had tons of wilted slimy pieces on it. The chicken or turkey was dry and chewy. The walnuts were not candied and the salad dressing was non existent. Basically this salad was not even edible and I ended up throwing it out after I picked out the edible bits. Sad :(
1,"This place never disappoints me! It's conveniently down the street from me and I always order takeout when I'm feeling lazy, ha!\n\nThey have great prices and delicious food, I always order the Family Meals with my spam musubi on the side, I'm obsessed with their noodles! Delivery takes about 30-45 minutes though, but it is expected since they are whipping up your food.\n\nTheir slush bobas are delicious as well, the tapioca balls are always perfect, I always have the bad luck of getting hard balls. It's hard to find good chinese joints but this one is at the top of my list!"
1,"I don't travel as much as some people, but I really like the fact that it's so easy to navigate.  Signs are clearly marked that it's nearly impossible to get lost.  You can also play the slots while you wait for your flight which is something you can't do at most other airports.  There's a decent amount of restaurants spread throughout the airport as well.  It didn't take me long to get through security or anything.  I wouldn't mind having a layover or a delayed flight here."
1,"Everything is always great service, food, and atmosphere. My only complaint is I came back from vacation and my bartender Matt is not longer here. I won't be back as often now that he is gone."

1,"I love Scooby Do's! When I bring in my yelping dog (and her bark could break glass) they accept her with open arms and patient hearts. Somehow the staff there endures 3+ hours of ear mutilation, and when I return for her, she smells sweet, is softy and shiny white and she no longer rubs her behind on the floor. They never complain about her and even feign affection when I bring her in.   \n\nThe entire staff is very friendly, they do a proper papillon cut and their prices are lower than Petsmart. I could go on and on...they're just great. I've already referred several people there and they concur."
0,"We arrived fairly early on a Saturday night for Las Vegas expecting a traditional piano bar.  We came up with a list of several songs that were good sing along songs. It wasn't too busy and we gave a $20 tip along with the list of songs.  My sister also gave a list and a $10 tip.   The piano player didn't seem to know most of them (he could play American Pie by Don McLean) that that was about it.  Instead of playing any of our songs we requested or admitting he didn't know them, he turned the mike over to the bartender (I admit was a great singer) and a few people who shouldn't be singing.  That included the rap song that some may consider art. It used the M-F*&^%r word in almost every line.\n\nThe main reason why I would never go back there is the way the piano player took our tip money and ignored all of our requests.  I think he was more interested in playing the piano and letting others do the entertaining.  I think their venue should be listed as Karaoke and Open Mike night.  It defnintely was not piano bar, it lonly housed a piano."
1,Exactly what I expect for a quick cheap lunch spot when I'm craving a hot dog and fries.  Prices are right and the fire dog was delicious.  Will definitely return.
1,"I had a customer come in and her nails were banging so I told her I had to know where she had gone so that I could try to get my swag on her level.  To my delight she told me the place was just a few minutes away on Ray and Rural!  Now I'm not the type of girl who goes to the nail salon every week for mani-pedi's but a friend was doing a music video shoot and I was going to be in it so I figured I could expense it at that point...I'm sending him the bill.\n\nWalked in on Friday at around 1:00 and the lobby was pretty full so I debated leaving because I was on my lunch break and while I can get away with a lot I knew that it would probably be frowned upon if I took a 2 hour lunch.  Luckily everyone was helped within minutes of my arrival and they were able to get me right in.  The girl who was in charge of my nail transformation was Natalie and she was awesome.  Suuuuper sweet, call me a sucker for pet names but she kept calling me \""honey\"" and I wasn't mad at it.  She actually made conversation too which was nice 'cause I'm not all about that awkward silence you get with most nail experiences.  She did a great job too, my french tip toes are on point and my nails are able to be seen in public again.  I'm going to have to step my game up at work because coming here makes me WANT to be one of those girls who's in the salon every week."

1,"Well the food was pretty yummy, but this place gets 4 stars because of the hot waiter with the tattoos and mohawk! \n\nI got the noodle things with pork (chow fun?) and my friend got some other thing that was super tasty! \n\nThe waiters are nice, and I will def go back for the hottie!"
1,"Food is surprisingly good for a bar!  Well worth it.  When I first moved to the neighbourhood I went almost every night for dinner...casual atmosphere, nice bar.\nDon't get there too late on the weekend if you are eating as it turns into more of a nightclub type hangout, which is also cool, but different than the dinner spot you think you are heading to!\nIt's kind of tucked away in the basement, you see it off the street, but need to look for it."

0,"Have visited several JCS over the years in many cities, but this is by FAR the worst as far as the food is concerned.\nI have great balls of fire for appetizer, HORRIBLE to say the least! They were so dry and overcooked. I asked my waitress for a fresh batch, but she tried to tell me that's how they were suppose to be (as if it were my first time having them).\nMy crab legs were small and tasted watery. I couldn't believe how bad all my food was there!\nI can't believe the cook is employed there! WRONG COOK! He doesn't have a clue of what he is doing. \nI will not return to this location....."
1,"This particular LA Fitness manages to be well patronized pretty much around the clock while never being packed.  It results in an upbeat, lively atmosphere filled with pick up games of basketball and a strong class schedule.\n\nI attend some of the pilates classes and have also gone to some of the total body workout classes - all of the instructors have been great.\n\nLA Fitness is not a \""luxury\"" gym, but it has pretty much everything you'd want at a reasonable price.  Paris, the general manager, really cares about the operation, and it shows.  He knows all of the members, and you'll frequently find him mingling and trying to make the gym better."
0,Stopped in here while shopping because there was no place else to go. I did not have high expectations and my expectations were met. The food was marginal although the service was good. The burger just wasn't very good.
1,"One of the most authentic places to get Chinese food in the city. I've heard of servers being rude but had no such experience, they were quite curt though.\n\nWent with a friend. We ordered salt and pepper squid, spinach w/ garlic and crispy chicken with dry garlic oil.\n\nThe flavors were spot on, authentic Cantonese."
0,"Wow.  I was SO disappointed in this experience.  I watch Iron Chef fairly religiously and had always thought Batali and Morimoto were the chefs to beat, and was totally looking forward to eating at a Batali restaurant while in Vegas.  So as I checked the reviews of all three of his places I noticed two were $$$$ and this one was $$ but they all got similar reviews.  Similar in that there were more dissatisfied customers than I was comfortable with.  So we decided to play it safe and test out ESM for lunch, and if it was good, check out one of the others for dinner another day.  Needless to say, this was our only Batali experience.\n\nOur service from the hostess was great, she sat my husband and I at a four person table so we could both sit on one side and watch the \""street show\"" in St. Mark's square.  One star for that.  But sadly, good service then came to a screeching halt.  We saw very little of our server throughout the rest of the meal.   He dropped off the boring cold bread and took our orders, and we didn't see him again until after our food had been removed from the table and he came back for our dessert order.  And after that was done, it took him forever again for the check.\n\nWe ordered the balsamic marinated figs to start, the gemeli pasta with house sausage and broccoli rabe as our first course, the pork shoulder as our main course, and the cactus pear sorbet and goat cheese gelato for dessert.   I absolutely LOVE figs and enjoyed this first dish very much although it wasn't particularly unique or difficult to prepare.  Half a star for the figs.  The pasta was disgusting.  I agree with everyone else who says he gives \""al dente\"" a new meaning--the pasta was not cooked enough at all for my liking.  The sausage was completely flavorless, and the bitterness of the broccoli rabe completely dominated everything.  If our waiter had come back to check on us, we would have told him so.  The pork shoulder WAS good, I'll give them that, but I make an equally delicious pork shoulder in my crockpot at home for MUCH cheaper.  Another half star for the pork.  By this time my husband was trying to convince me that we didn't need to spend any more money here on dessert, but I was determined to give it one last chance.  I saw the goat cheese gelato on the menu and since I LOVE goat cheese, I figured it had to be money.  Sadly no, this dish was as bad as the pasta one.  The cactus pear sorbet was saccharine sweet and the goat cheese gelato tasted nothing like goat cheese...and they were even worse when eaten together.  We ended up eating only three or four bites of our $12 dessert.  \n\nI am sure we must have just had horrible luck on the dishes we ordered because I am having a really hard time believing that this food was representative of Mario Batali's cooking, but I'm pretty sure everyone in the restaurant the day we were there (and we would notice whenever we passed by throughout our visit) was also receiving horrid service.  So many bored, hungry looking people straining their necks to find their server.  Inexcusable.  \n\nHope you have better luck there."
0,"what a dump.\n\nRUDE staff.\n\nsecurity was a breeze, checking in wasn't awful. but it was just so gross and very disappointing with the non-accommodating staff. \n\nidk. you have no choice though, thats part of going to vegas.. right?"
1,"What a wonderful find in the Central Phoenix area!  We just finished the Children's Museum and wanted to get a quick, healthy bite to eat before heading home.  After two attempts at different deli establishments (both closed on Sundays), we stumbled upon Zookz. \n\nI had #15 (the turkey, cranberries, roasted almonds, and a light curry sauce) with a side of Kale salad.  It was light, tasty, filling, and satisfying!  The combination of these wonderful, fresh ingredients made my mouth as happy has can be.  Of course, the best part was the toasted bread-you've got to experience it!  You'll see nothing like this anywhere.  My boyfriend had a breakfast sandwich (don't recall which one it actually was), but he said it was delicious too!  \n\nIf you crave something fresh, healthy, and original (the toasted bread-like Panini pocket), you have to try this place, it's totally worth it!"
1,Great Filet Mignon. Asked medium rare but received it medium but still very juicy and tender.  Double baked loaded baked potato was huge and amazing.  Great for dates but was actually there with a bachelor party of 10 men and worked out great.  Very pricey but when in Rome..

1,Ethiopian food is without a doubt one of my favorite ethnic foods and Tana provides delicious options that are truly authentic.  Many of the other reviews mention the slow service which is true but as you begin to talk with the owner / bartender / server / cook (yes when we went he was all of those things) the immediate personal connection you make and the friendly conversation which follows makes the wait bearable.\n\nTana has replaced Abay in my book as best Ethiopian in the burgh
0,"Their yogurt is good, but personally I'd recommend yogurtology or mojo better, for the flavor and especially because I really like the self-service system."
0,"There's a reason why this place is closed.....\n\nI guess I'll leave it at that, since apparently I'm a bit too late to review it while it was open.  I just hope that the restaurants in the other cities due a better job with the food."
0,"I've always said I avoid \""fusion\"" restaurants. I am a vegetarian and it should be easy to find something anywhere... but with fusion dishes it's nearly impossible to customize or substitute entrees and that creates problems for my diet and (mushroom) allergy.\n\nLast night while arriving 45 min. prior to watching \""perks of being a wallflower\"" (watch it!) I noticed this place next door. I have been wanting to try \""tapas\"" (this was not that style of small plates)... \n\nMy friend and I stopped in and ordered two individual glasses of sake wine \n(try the top red option if you dine here! I had the white peach- meh.) I simply ordered dessert which was the banana fritter + ice cream. It was good but nothing spectacular. Ordinary deep fried 'nana, fruit as a garnish, and a scoop of ice cream. Not even really worth the $6. Why didn't I eat any 'real food'? I only noticed one tofu dish listed throughout the whole menu. Not very impressed. And NOT veggie friendly. \nI've been to other sushi places and usually I can at best find a ramen noodle option. Not the case here.\n\nAlso, the female server was nice 'n all, she mentioned. . .\""Oh if you ever stop here AFTER your movie you can bring your ticket stub and get a discount\"" \nUh....... cool? Not helping us tonight. We also split the bill. 2 cards. she charged mine twice! How do you mess that up? We weren't even in a rush. \n\nAs the yelp rating ^ states, \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"""
1,"I like coming here when I'm craving for Chinese and am on my boyfriend's side of town. The place is nice and I like their big booths. The servers are pretty nice and quick with things also. I like most of the foods that I've ordered but the house fried rice that my little sister ordered, in my opinion is a waste of money it's nothing special. Other Chinese restaurants make better fried rice so just don't order that. Everything else is fine."
1,"Who has two thumbs and loves Fatmans? THIS GUY! Hours are a bit odd, but waiting for those doors to open is worth every delicious bite of that menu."
0,"This place is HORRIBLE!! Ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito. It didnt have any chorizo in it at all! It was dry and made of corn beef hash. Which they are trying to pass off as chorizo I guess. When I asked if they had maybe got my order wrong the waitress simply said No you got the chorizo burrito. However I am SURE that is not what I got. Couldnt even eat it and they didnt even care. I spoke with the owner about it and all he said was that he would love to take me into the kitchen and \""show me\"" the chorizo. TERRIBLE customer service and the WORST breakfast I have ever had! Its really hard to screw up breakfast! Dont waste you time!!"
1,"Went with the family of 4, we had a great time, food is a bit bland, so ask for the spice. I did not think I would like the Miso soup but was pleasantly surprised. We had a birthday girl , they did make it very special for her. I had the chicken and would have hoped it would not been so dry , but was a little disappointed. Overall a good family experience, A little pricey but worth the experience if you have not done it before."
0,Waste of time and money. My wheels are still dirty. Inside was barely wiped down and can tell no cleaner was used just a dry towel that left lint EVERYWHERE. I should've known a good job couldn't have been done in the 6 minutes I was there.
0,"I always think of Mickies as a must-go place when I am in town, but this time around, I questioned why that is the case.  The food was decidedly mediocre, not cheap and the wait was interminable.  My companion's omelet, ordered with pepperjack cheese, was served with cheddar sprinkled on top.  My mushroom and swiss omelet almost certainly was made with slimy canned mushrooms.  The fried cheese curds - which my every visit to Madison must include - were forgettable, sadly.  Even the coffee was not up to snuff.  At least the waitstaff was friendly and trying hard."
1,"For the win! I was wondering, aimlessly you might say, in the general direction of downtown from the strip when, hungry for something other than a $5.99 \""prime rib special,\"" I found Amanecer Salvadoreno.\n\nI had never had Salvadorian food. Clearly, that was a mistake on my part, because everything I had at Amanecer Salvadoreno was amazing.\n\nSalty pulled pork with eggs, fried plantains, pupusa, fried corn things, all washed down with a tasty Salvadorian soda? Ahhh... I'm still not clear on exactly I had is called because of the language barrier, but that's all part of the adventure."
0,"I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money."
0,"Avoid Marcel Painting at all costs. We hired them to paint the interior of our house and kitchen cabinets. They failed to tape off the windows, fixtures and parts of the carpet. We now have over-spray everywhere that we have to clean up. The fixtures were ruined and had to be replaced. The kitchen cabinets were not properly cleaned and sanded. They are full of bumps and runs. I would not hire them to paint a dog house."
0,AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL :( I was so so so super excited to try this place and not one single item we ordered was any good..\n\ncrab and artichoke dip literally tasted like creamy water\nfried  tuna roll- gross\nmozzarella sticks were ok but the sauce was worthless\nportabella mushroom burger was loaded with a gross amount of cheese and wayyy to salty\npizza was flavorless \n\nso sad because we were so so excited to try based off the reviews
1,"All around my favorite resort casino in Vegas. First off, great casino with lots of options and even reasonable minimums. The interior of the casino/hotel is amazing. They have lots of statues and paintings and really fall in line with the Roman Theme. The forum shops are great and include many of the popular designers with helpful sales personel. And finally, the buffet. The number #1 rated buffet in Vegas and it is well worth the $50 you spend to get in. Crab legs, sushi, steak, ribs, lamb, tacos, muscles, clams, pastas, you name it they have it and it all tastes as though it was ordered as an individual entre."
1,Every time is just as good if not better than the last. Thank god I don't live closer I would be here every day! On this visit the bread was extremely fresh and added to the overall awesomeness of Corleone's. Keep up the good work!!!
0,"BOOOO \nThis place was WACK/WEAK/CORNY/BORING/etc etc \n\nThe bouncer dude at the door had major attitude & rolled his eyes at us for not leaving out of the exit door instead of the entrance door. You would think l he was bouncing for a club that had a real importance or something. Dude your bouncing at a chick bar in a hotel get over urself \n\nWalked in place was dead & so were the girls, well the three girls that were there & that's including the bartender who had a major attitude as well. Really in this empty dump you should be happy someone even walked in there \n\nDrinks were overpriced w/the next drink free promotion but the odds of anyone staying in there must've been the catch. The place was so boring we did not even stay for a second drink as a matter of fact we left out with the first drink in hand & headed somewhere else \n\nThe girl on the mic was annoying & supposedly some bad ass shit talker but more like some annoying chick that you wish would just STFU & let me enjoy my overpriced drink \n\nThe crowd was about 10 old men & 1 old granny that was at the bar getting alcohol poured into her mouth,that's how bad it was \nyou know it's bad when you see granny with a fanny pack on getting tequila poured down her throat.. Yea umm ok time to go for sure now"
0,"1 star?  Why?  2 Words - FOOD POISONING on the night of 11/05/2011\n\nTotally ruined my last date night with my wife before I deploy for the military when you are praying to the porcelain gods hurling with nori blowing out of your nose...graphic I know...\n\n\nTo top it off, the rolls were mediocre compared to Sushi Twister and Sushi Xtreme and the service was slow for the amount of people in the restaurant.  \n\nWhat are my credentials to be badmouthing this \""highly\"" rated yelp institution?  5 years living on Honolulu and knowing what sushi restaurants are supposed to taste like, but what do I know...uggh worst night ever afterwards SMH"
1,"Oh Vegas.\n\nYou've changed. \n\nFriend to friend.\n\nIt's not for the better.\n\nThe days when every hotel was competing to get you up to the front of the hotel with free shows are over. And yea.. if I sound like a broken record about it.. that's because I am extremely bitter about it.\n\nVegas used to give you the ability to visit on a budget, enjoy yourself.. waste only some of your money in their slot machines and still have a blast.\n\nAll the frustration aside... the Mirage still does it right. \n\nThe volcano is one of the most fun and attended attractions in Vegas still to this day. The girlfriend and I watched this twice in one night from different vantage points.. Highly recommended. It's a blast of a time. You feel the heat and you can't help but get into the drum beat."
1,Great service. Movie theatres aren't always too clean though.
1,"First time trying this place today almost looks like one of those hole in the wall places from the outside but going inside its nice, me and the wife ordered the mozerella tomato basil sandwich....sooo good the bread is amazing the sandwich is so simple but works so well together. Definitely recommend this to who haven't tried it."
0,We were looking to enjoy the concert at the mall using the San Felipe Cantinas patio.  The manager was Extremely rude and told us that unless we were going to order an entree we would not be allowed to dine at his restaurant.  We had full intentions of ordering drinks and appetizers.  With an attitude like that we took our business across the courtyard to Cadillac Ranch.  Excellent food and very courteous staff.
0,Bento box....blew.
0,"McCormick & Schmick's is an adequate chain restaurant that clearly is a carbon copy of others located around the country.  The food is decent, but formulaic.  If you can get the wait staff to break from the script, they are usually quite friendly and eager to please.  As with many large \""upscale\"" chain restaurants, butter seems to be the ingredient that is frequently overdone.  McCormick & Schmick's is no different.  They offer a 50% discount on lunches to employees of the South Side Works, and if I didn't benefit from that, I would never pay their normal prices for the food you get."
1,"We go to Arties all the time and have never had any issues and love it more now that they have a post office in the back, so we don't have to drive to the post office. It is a little cramped, but the staff has always been great in helping me find things. I also love the fact that I can take my dog. She loves to go in there but I won't take her during very busy times."
1,"4 stars for surprising me with great hotel food. My expectations weren't too high and I ordered some chips and guac to keep it simple and what came out was nachos taken to another level. Spice was just perfect and the guac was the right amount for this size of the plate. Not the best guac, weren't not talking chipotle here but the mix of peppers and cheese was refreshing.  Add that with some local IPA to top it off and I got to say they knocked it out of the park here.  I couldn't wait to finish my meal and I'm eating it as im posting this review. Service was also good too, asked me how I liked it twice to make sure I was satisfied. I just arrived and will be here til Friday, I'll definitely will be coming back."
0,"Food ok. Service consistently poor to awful. Lighting painfully low. \n\nSpecialty burger restaurant whose burger patties are only ok - today dry, rubbery, fairly flavourless though previously better - and flavour combinations pretty mediocre. Assorted deep fried foods are pretty good including the very expensive cheese curds. I had the toadstool burger. The mushrooms and cheese faded away against the charred flavour of the patty which was slightly pink inside and black on the outside. The bun was soggy. The garlic sauce remarkably tasty. For $7.50 ish I felt ripped off. Would recommend getting a cheeseburger to go from five guys to be honest!\n\nService has been poor on previous visits and today was especially bad. \""Emily\"" took her time before she finally came by our table. Then she asked us for our drink orders three times in the space of two minutes. Then a five minute gap... When I said we were ready to order she inexplicably turned around, walked off and disappeared for another five minutes. The rest of the service was adequate in a surly teenage kinda way though she also failed to mention that the cider on the menu was listed incorrectly. When it arrived it was actually peach flavoured and not to my taste at all. However I couldn't be bothered wrestling with her further so can't really blame the restaurant entirely for having suffered through an entire glass of the stuff. \n\nOverall, we will not be returning. Between the dingy lighting (I think meant to create atmosphere...?!!!), the mediocre, overpriced food and the appalling service I would recommend you go elsewhere too."
0,"Qualification - I am rating the Healthy Marketplace side and not the coffee bar:\n\nJust left a movie and wanted to pick up something quick/easy to go - drove by Luci's the other day so I stopped there to grab some chow.  The space itself is cool and has potential.  But...\n\n1.  Many of the goods are the same as in the grocery (some stuff from regular groceries, other stuff from Sprouts/Trader Joes type places) but they cost more.  Five or six bucks for some healthy cereal.  In particular I was disappointed in the wine.  I guess its just my style, but I like a variety of affordable small-production wines.  They had small production wines, just not cheap.  And then they had the same Clois du Bois red wine that has been on sale for $8.99 in Fry's/Albertsons/Safeway for the last five years, except here it was $13.99.\n2.  Grabbed a chef salad and a meatloaf sandwich to go.  Salad looked good (and was) - big pieces of chicken and egg - but,....   No dressing!!  The meatloaf was Ok at best, the bread was probably sliced and placed in the box 8 hours ago, and it came with 2 wedges (wedges for a sandwich?) of tomato and two little tiny strings of roasted red pepper.\n\nI had high hopes based on the name/location/etc., but I was disappointed.  Maybe try some quirky grocery items and wines?"
0,"If I could give less than one star I would.  I lived around the corner from this place for 8 years.   It's consistently filthy.  The staff is typically rude.  The food is almost always disgusting (I DO like Burger King, but this restaurant is always gross)  There are a ton of other places to eat in the South Side... skip this place."
0,"The place is in a sketchy neighborhood, the inside was a dump, the charbroiled beef was all fatty, and the Penang was mediocre. My jasmine tea didn't even taste like jasmine!  They even messed up desert! The sticky rice was poorly made and the fried banana was oily. The coconut ice cream was powdery tasting and not much flavor.  Not sure what all the hype is. Maybe people are just starstruck by the pictures of famous people that ate here a long, long, time ago."
1,"For Summerlin natives, it's easy to take Maru for granted.  It's practically in our backyard, we see it everyday taking kids to school, and it seems to always be open.  For non-fans of Korean food, it's easy to go there once, then forget about it, but if you like this type of cuisine, there's no reason to think it's any steps lower than a Korean restaurant you'd find in Koreatown (Spring Mtn & Jones) or on the Strip...and certainly no reason to have to drive further.\n\nMaru, although its clientele tends to be mostly non-Asian, has not dumbed down the menu to just the usual staples of the middle-American palate (bulgogi, kalbi, etc.).  Those items are definitely available, and are done expertly, but the more authentic array of tripe soups, steamed rice bowls, and very spicy noodle dishes are all on the menu, and I would think the fully-Korean cooks are delighted to get one of these offerings on a ticket once in a while.  They're delicious, like everything else here...except...\n\n...for the sushi.  As an Asian, I've always contended that the Japanese should run Japanese restaurants, Koreans should run Korean eateries, and the Chinese should stay with Chinese fare.  As sushi has exploded in popularity since the 80's, it seems like Asian restauranteurs of every ilk now think they can roll sushi right...but unfortunately, that still isn't the case.  A few times, our white tuna or yellowtail have arrived obviously quickly thawed out (and consequently lacking any body or true flavor), and they seem to try to make up for it by putting a gigantic slice of fish on top of an oversized rice cushion.  In short, I would not take my Japanese mother here for sushi!\n\nBut if you stick with any Korean menu item, you'll be delighted.  The matriarch of the family will undoubtedly come by your table at some point in your dinner to offer her gratitude for your visit, and ask you for any special requests.  She does this from her heartfelt feeling that you are visiting her home, and not for some marketing or \""feelgood\"" effect.  Koreans are a very proud and passionate people...and the food they prepare from their homeland at Maru represents them well!\n\nI almost forgot to mention the kimchi and appetizer assortment that you get with every meal.  This, too, is the real deal, and if you see something missing (occasionally, they seem to cycle through their available items and bring out, say, 7 out of the 10 goodies they have in the back), just ask.  A few of the more fringe items you may get at a restaurant on Normandie in LA may not be available - maybe a pickled squid, a type of dried fish, or a blanched pearl onion - but almost anything you'd find at any Korean restaurant will gladly be brought to you if you ask.\n\nAll in a fabulous, ultra-modern decor with comfortable and expansive tables.  Why leave Summerlin?"
1,We were having cold stalling problems with our Honda Pilot. Took it to 2 places nearer to where we live but they couldn't diagnose and repair. Only thing left to do was take it to whiteys even though we now live 100 miles away. Well worth it. Mark diagnosed it and repaired it first try.  Others were going to start replacing parts and hope for the best.
1,"K'Os is a great place to go for happy hour. They have awesome specials and the drink prices aren't bad at all. I've been here multiple times, and I have never had bad service. The patio is a dog friendly patio, which is nice. We go there for the sports games because there are 6 different tv's outside playing the different games, and you can get a little sound box for your table that will play the audio for the game you want to watch, which I thought was super cool. If you're looking to have some fun and watch a game and have some drinks, I would suggest you try K'Os."
1,"I stopped in here with my father for Sunday brunch.  As we walked in the door I immediately felt comfortable, like we had walked into the right place.  The atmosphere is cool and laid back.  I also noticed the nice Bloody Mary bar which was conveniently located right in the middle of the restaurant.  While I did not partake, I most certainly would recommend it for anyone who enjoys Bloody Marys.\n\nOur waitress was very nice and attentive, making sure our coffee and water never ran out.  I ordered the veggie benedict which was really excellent.  My dad ordered sausage, eggs, and grits.  The grits were really good and made just the way I like them.  The sausage was in large links rather than patties which was a bit unexpected.  My father did not particularly like the sausage.  I tried it and it was indeed a bit different, but I enjoyed it.\n\nThis is really a great place and I'm glad I finally got the chance to try it for myself.  All in all really good experience and I look forward to coming back!"
0,"On advise from a friend I took my car in for a check engine light, they diagnosed it and  quoted to fix the car. I gave them the go ahead and picked my car up, I drove my car less then ten miles and the light  came back on, I tried to call the shop back and tell them what had happend and they told me to bring the car back. So I did then they said that I had another issu and to me it would be anothe 400 dollars more. I gave them the go ahead again, Picked up my car again and before I got home the light came on again. At this point I was so upset I decided to take my car to another shop. \nonce there it turned out that I had a hole in some vaccum line and that was the cause of the light. After the line was changed my car was better and the check engine light never came on.... Sunset auto thanks, but no thanks... you really did a number on me"
1,"Actual rating 4.5. Venue and cocktails bump up the rating.\n\nFor a Saturday evening the No1DP and I wanted to do a \""dinner and show\"" date Vegas style. For us, this meant either fine dining or upscale casual with a named chef. He already booked the show way in advance and left me in charge of planning dinner. As the show we were going to was a fun show in New York-New York, I didn't want to go anywhere too extravagant. \n\nVENUE\n1) Chef Rick Moonen is well known for his seafood restaurant \""rm seafood\"" in the lower level. This is his take on comfort food in large and small plates made to be shared.\n2) Restaurant is decorated in Victorian period steampunk-style. Prominent features are that the women are dressed in bustiers, which the No1DP noted to be different for each waitress. This was confirmed, letting the waitress express herself while conforming to dress code. Furniture pieces were appropriate to the time. Sofa was comfy.\n3) A cocktail program managed by the talented Eric Smith, who kinda looks like the current Doctor with glasses.\n\nSERVICE: Staff took care of us. Waiters attended to us, bussers served our food and I had a little chat with Eric himself. \n\nDRINKS: Cocktail menu is served on an iPad. No1DP noticed that you can e-mail your orders. I hope he used this feature for the wines as I am having a total brain fart for not remembering the exact wines we had. I tend to do this for restaurants with notable cocktail menus as I tend to pay attention to the cocktails more :/\n\nNo1DP got the Smoked Whiskey and Cola ($15). The whiskey is smoked to order with cherrywood chips. The cola is a housemade concoction with various spices as to not make the coke too sweet and enhance the smokiness of the whiskey. No1DP never had anything like this before and enjoyed his drink.\n\nI got the Mario Took the Wrong Pipe ($14). I actually had a talk with Eric about this particular drink. Caipirinhas are one of my most favorite cocktails and I was impressed on his method of using cacha\u00e7a - mixing it with cura\u00e7ao, egg whites and extra virgin olive oil to make the drink a lot more smooth than the caipirinha and still have that burst of citrus each sip. Finally cacha\u00e7a is used in a cocktail other than a caipirinha!\n\nFor our dishes No1DP got an oaked Chardonnay and I got a Cabernet. Wine parings were sufficient, the tannins went well with our quite savory dishes. \n\nFOOD\nRx Fish Tacos in Taro Root Shells ($12): The kampachi is done as a ceviche and the \""taco\"" shell is delicate enough that the taco could fall apart mid-bite and the fish flavors and textures can shine through.\n\nLamb Osso Bucco Greek Style ($28): I've had veal osso bucco in the traditional Italian style and I like this interpretation better. The lamb is braised so that the meat is tender and falls off the bone. The meat is covered in its own juices and the orzo soaks these juices nicely. There were two pieces of lamb cut perfectly for sharing. \n\nLobster Bolognaise ($38): Pasta was perciatelli. Lobster and pasta were also prepared to be shared. I could still taste the lobster even with the bolognaise sauce. No1DP notes that the pasta was just a tad too chewy.\n\nMoonen Tater Tots ($9): Big tater tots that were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Potatoes were not greasy. Decent, but might pick another side next time.\n\nCookies & Milk ($9): Made to order chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies. Milk poured nicely as it had a higher cream content. Outside was crisp so cookie didn't fall apart but center was moist and chewy. Cookies were rich yet lost some of its richness and moistness the next day.\n\nThe No1DP and I had such a great time that we ended up being a little late to our show. We noticed that the restaurant was empty for a Saturday night and hope that this restaurant will still exist the following year. The cocktails bridge the gap between the comfort food and the Victorian steampunk theme; while the cocktails can survive without the restaurant, the restaurant cannot survive without the cocktails. If the restaurant does close I hope that Eric's cocktails can survive in some other form."
1,"Good food, service and atmosphere. If i lived here this would be our hot spot."
0,"Came here to study - because of the music, this place was louder than Saturday night bar even though it was early afternoon on a weekday. It is also full of out-of-work hipsters. Headed for a more coffee-shop like coffee shop."
0,"Five stars?  Eek.  \n\nI dont wanna get all highbrow here, but prospective diners probably shouldnt harbor illusions about a place charging $7 for a couple of chicken fried \""steaks\"" big enough to flop over the edge of the plate.  \n\nNeither of us finished our cow patties and we both felt a little sick afterwards. Not violently ill or anything, just that bloated, greasy feeling culminating in a concise bout of diarrhea.  \n\nThe service is ok and it's cheap, but in terms of food quality, there are half a dozen better restaurants within a hundred yards of this place - seven if you count Taco Bell."
1,"I have been to this location twice, both during restaurant week and both times the service was excellent and so was the meal!\nI started with the house mixed salad, but I was disappointed after tasting my sister's Caesar salad which was far superior to my choice. \nI opted for the filet which was cooked perfectly and the oscar style accompaniment, which had a generous amount of crab. \nThe meal ended with a slice of cheesecake with strawberry topping, which was a perfect consistency. \nDespite being very busy both times the waitstaff never made me feel rushed and tables were spaced far enough apart to keep the noise level down."
0,"The buffet is not even worth the 8.99 price.  There were maybe 6-7 dishes total to choose from and you probably wouldn't want 3 of them.  Scarce desserts, sad, sad salad bar.  Perhaps if they had a 2 for 1 local special it may have been worth it. I felt really bad for the servers. Not sure what the Kali style ribs were, perhaps they were the ribs of a cat!!"
0,"Purchased a suit here 3 years ago and was very happy with it. However, I had a far less than stellar experience here just this weekend. Long story short: they didn't have the top I wanted in the right color and size, but offered to have it shipped to me for no additional charge. Great, right? WRONG. What an ordeal. Sounds like a great option in terms of customer service but turned out to be a huge pain in the ass. Not so sure about this place anymore."
0,I went to Chop Shop with some buddies on a Monday night. The manager Alex did an awful job of managing how the food went out. My order took 35 minutes and the multiple people got their food before me even though I ordered first. Once the order came out it was missing sides and toppings. After complaining multiple times the manger took a very laid back approach. He said oh there are a whole bunch of orders back there. This manager was just awful and shouldn't be in such a position. He is clearly way over his head if he can't handle a Monday night. My visit was on 5-12-14 aprox 8:20 pm.
0,I have found them to be less than accomodating or helpful.
1,Tried their chicken pho & a sandwich the server recommended and everything was delicious. I was pretty hungover and it brought me back to life. The customer service was good too and it's at a pretty good location.
1,"We had a great experience with our \""to-go\"" order this afternoon.  The manager, Sam, was very helpful and enthusiastic.  His store was neat and clean and the employees were friendly.  It is nice to see someone excited about the company they work for and proud of the product they serve.  Our meal was excellent too!"
0,"If you like food seasoned with half a can of salt then this is your place. If you like your food being served to your husband and your kid and wait 30 minutes for your plate, then this is the place for you! The cashier was so apologetic and gave me a desert for free to try to make up for it at least. But Id expect WAY better for $45. At this rate and flavor, Filiberto's or Taco Bell would have been a better choice."
1,"I don't know if I'm missing something, but I really am a fan of Office!\n\nI'm not one to be swung easily by high street chains shoving fashion down our throats. But I always find Office caters for a lot of styles and sells shoes that are great quality even if they are expensive. Most Office shoes I've bought have lasted for years - even the tiny, cheaper dolly shoes have withstood the test of time (and the Scottish rain).\n\nThis branch of Office is more petite than the one I shop in regularly in Glasgow (or at least whenever I can afford it, ha), but it hits the spot. It has some great bargains on display as soon as you enter the store and a wide range of footwear for girls and guys. They do some snazzy formal shoes and their fair share of streetwear - catering for all types of feet! The staff in this branch are very friendly as well which is a bonus. Rather than turn on the smarm like some high end retail assistants are sometimes forced to do, the dude who served me in here was absolutely lovely and full of genuine banter! My card had been blocked by the bank for some reason (not his fault, most definitely mine for over spending) and he couldn't have been nicer about it. Even though it ended up being past closing time he was really patient and I liked talking to him! \n\nEven if you're not into the shoes in here, it's a great store with nice staff and stock. Worth a look."
1,The salon is professional  and luxurious. Stella S. Is incredibly sweet and amazingly talented!
0,"Bonfyre tries. They have interesting architectural elements (disclaimer - I used to work for the firm that designed Bonfyre), comfortable seating and a nice ambiance for the 'burbs.  That's about where my pleasant experience ended.\n\nFor one, our table was in front of the fireplace - the back of my chair was less than two feet away from the glass enclosure. On a frigid November evening, you'd think that'd be wonderful, but it was SO HOT. I literally felt as if I was getting a sunburn, and coats facing the fire were untouchably hot. It was so profoundly uncomfortable, even after we asked them to turn the fireplace down (they wouldn't turn it all the way off). \n\nThe table for 7 was not meant to hold that many, and once our appetizers and drinks arrived we were forced to hold the bulky menus in our laps because there was no longer anywhere to set them down. The appetizers were ok in taste but lacking in critical elements they advertized. The truffle fries needed more truffle oil or a better dip. There was no gravy on the poutine (I don't even know how it's called poutine without it, but I digress), but instead an oily \""poutine sauce\"" that didn't seem to have a flavor - it just seemed like curds and fries in extra oil.  The artichoke dip was good but so very greasy. \n\nAs a non-meat eating person (I just don't really like meat, sorry) who also dislikes cilantro, my menu options were very limited, but I expected that at a grille (the restaurant wasn't my choice). I was excited to see a margherita flatbread option, but again was terribly disappointed.\n\nMargherita is hard to screw up. big slices of fresh mozz. Tomatoes that can take center stage - heirloom, roma, sundried, something. Basil leaves. Drizzling of a good balsamic. Done.  Nope. None of that. Instead I got a grocery-store style thin crust with a thick base of shredded pizza-mozz, with mealy and yet unripe beefsteak slices and a half-sphere of a tiny fresh mozz ball on top of each slice. No balsamic or any dressing of any kind. The whole thing was just barely dusted with shredded basil and mostly tasted like a totinos pizza with no sauce.  I had a greek side salad with it that came with no dressing on it or with it at all - just some olives, red pepper, and feta on a bed of dry greens.\n\nThey did have a delicious malbec, so at least the night was not a total waste. The server, however, forgot to bring me the soda I ordered after it was clear I'd had plenty of malbec, and only refilled our party's water glasses once. Between the excessive heat, drinking the wine too quickly to wash down the bland, sticky, greasy food, I was left chewing ice just to keep from passing out.\n\nTurn the heat down on the patrons and up on the menu, and I can see that it'd be a nice place."
1,"Finally ran into Joe's truck at the First Fridays art walk in Phoenix.  Several food trucks and vendors on hand, but lets talk Filipino food.\nI tried the adobe chicken and Pancit and I was impressed.  Great Adobe chicken dish that put a  a $7 dent in the pocket.  It came with 2 pieces of chicken and rice on the bottom of the chicken.  The dish is on the smaller side so I am glad I ordered another dish.  The chicken is seasoned well and the skin holds most of the flavor, good thing you have plain rice just in case the sodium is overwhelming on the skin to even the flavor out.\nI also enjoyed the Pancit at $8 a dish and very large.  I would of enjoyed more meat in it, but the noodles and rice was overflowing the dish.  I did enjoy it, however my other taste testers and myself hinted at the slightly bland flavor.  Wish the dish had more flavor in it.  \nGoing from the well seasoned adobe chicken to the more bland Pancit was a disappointment.  I will order the adobe chicken again and if I crave Pancit I would still order it here.  Especially if I was hungry, since the Pancit dish is a large portion of food.\nOther items on the menu is Lumpia and sugar cane Coke for $2 and waters for $1.  I am sure the Lumpia is great, but I did not have enough cash and stomach storage to sample 3 dishes.  \nIf you see Joe's trucks and crave some Filipino food I am sure you will enjoy it.  It seems to be the closest Filipino food place in Arizona that I run into."
0,"I love hot n juicy. But I'm going to stick to the locations on spring mountain because the service at this location SUCKS. \n\nOur server was a Filipino guy and he was friendly and upbeat, but he seemed more interested in having conversations with his co workers behind the registers. He forgot our refills so after 15 mins we had to get another server's attention. And she forgot too! \nFood was good, but the service at this location isn't the same like the other locations. The girls and guys at the spring mountain locations are always moving fast and friendly. Won't be coming here again."
1,"Excellent service by Michele. First time coming to a massage parlor outside a spa. Price is very reasonable, ambiance really nice. Will definitely be coming back and sending the husband."
0,"Service was horrible.  Six of us went to dinner and as we have done for 20 years, brought our 20-30 year old wines to enjoy with dinner.  In the past, we paid $25-$50 corkage which was fine.  Cut limited us to only 2 bottles for 6 people.  We had 5 people, and of course we wanted to sit together, so we negotiated to get 3 bottles.  We tried to split tables as we get 2 per table, but they wouldn't let us do that.  So, we agreed to open 3 bottles.  They would charge $50 corkage.  That's $50 to open and drink a bottle of wine we brought to the restaurant.  They would waive that corkage fee if we bought a bottle from them equal to or greater in value than $50.  \nSo, we sat down and ordered our first 2 bottles of wine for $50 each, minimum.  Another person appeared and told us that, as our wines may have been worth more than $50, we would have to buy a bottle from them equal to or greater in value than each bottle we were opening.  Scott said he had bought his 2 bottles for about $10 in the 1990's.  Who knows what they're worth now?  They appeared prepared to haggle over the value of our wines.  This was such nonsense, we finally just got up and left.  They didn't try to stop us.  \nLast year, Carnevino accepted us without such stupid rules and we were allowed to bring our own wines.  We were told this is Wolfgang Puck's rules, so we had no choice.  In reality, they just wanted us to pay for hyper inflated wines from their wine list - they charge 4 or 5 times the market price of a wine - and also pay them for over priced steaks, together with terrible service.  We left, found Morel's, a much better restaurant, and enjoyed our wines and a great dinner.  The wait staff was attentive, helpful and appreciative.  Cut is not a place to eat if you want to be treated well, unless you have a huge wallet and willing to unload it there.\nNone of our party will ever patronize a Wolfgang Puck restaurant in this lifetime.  We encourage you to do the same."
1,Don't come for the service...don't come for the ambiance or cleanliness...don't come for the other food. Come for the pie. Jack Daniel's Pecan is divine.  Lemon cream is outstanding. Rhubarb is top-notch. there's no other reason to stop here and if you're driving by you need to stop here.  It's all about the pie.
0,"Gross..went to this place on a Sunday and the bathrooms were disgusting. No toilet paper or paper towels to be found. When I addressed w management my reply was well its the end of the weekend. Soooo you only clean your bathroom on Friday?? The first thing I want in a restaurant/bar is a bathroom to use, this to me is a minor detail that should be primary when management comes in for every shift. Instead you have employees standing around doing nothin!"
0,"Nice casual atmosphere....\n\nHowever the food was underwhelming to say the least.   If I was eating in a airport cafe or a 3 star hotel lobby, the food would be decent.   It was plain boring and lacked any intensity.\n\nService....Bleah!\n\nSerious WP, do you just want to say you have a bunch of restaurants in Vegas or do you really care what your restaurants are actually serving?   I get it.  Tourist trap, lots of foot traffic....easy money.  Yeah you don't care."
1,"Fantastic food, fantastic service, fantastic atmosphere!!!  Kenny, the owner and master chef is knowledgeable offering suggestions on customer favorites and telling me what I might not like.  As I waited for food to go he fed me samples!  They are all about the customer and pleasing.  Lotus root cake, crispy veggie beef, chicken and mushrooms, chicken vegetable sizzling plate amungst the tastiest food they have to offer.  My 1 and 3 year old girls could not get enough of the soy shrimp.  I also ate in the restaurant for my mom's birthday and they treated us like family!!!  Such an excellent find for vegans and non-vegans alike.  My new favorite restaurant!"
1,"The place was clean, nice, and the staff friendly.  My kids 6 and younger loved it.  My 9 year old was just ok.  He brought his ipod touch and that helped. I would highly recommend it to people who need a safe place to leave their kids for a few hours.  I wish they allowed kids to stay longer than 4 hours."
0,"I don't know if it was an off night, but the food was very disappointing. Especially considering the price of the food!  The appetizers were good and service exceptional. The main course, foie gras, was under cooked and all of the presentation beforehand was elegant for show, but the food still has to taste good. In my opinion, this is a very, very over priced French restaurant that is trying to add modern gastronomic flare...fail. I would rather go to Alinea for the real thing.   I had a much better culinary experience at a much cheaper restaurant called TAO. For people who are in the culinary field or eat high quality food frequently, go somewhere else and save your money...lots of money!!!!"
1,"This is the best massage place I've found in Las Vegas.  Their Thai Massages are even better than what I had in Thailand.  They have true professionals that know their craft well.  \n\nThe facility is impeccably clean, inviting and relaxing.  I took my girlfriend the first time and we had a simultaneous massage in the couples room.  \n\nI've been back five times and have always had an outstanding massage and great experience.  I typically book at the last minute, but it's usually better to have an advanced reservation.   \n\nAnna has been my favorite masseuse, but everyone there has years of experience.\n\nThis is definitely NOT a \""happy ending\"" massage place (like so many others in Vegas).  You will be happy if you're looking for an authentic Thai massage though."
1,"I went here for the first time on Saturday night. I had to go & try the famous Giant Fish Sandwich! When it arrived, I was impressed. The fish was even bigger than I expected & the batter was perfect. Also, the beer menu is lengthy! They serve beers from almost every corner of the world! I thought about trying something new, but turns out I was homesick for a good old Pennsylvania beer... :) Roland's is definitely a cool place in my book. I'll be back! :P"
0,"Eh such a nice looking restaurant with mediocre food and bad service. \n\nIt was our first morning on our trip and after a long first day traveling we didn't want to go far and this restaurant looked like it would suffice. Looks can be deceiving. \n\nWe were seated immediately and looked over the menu. Since we were planning on hitting up Wicked Spoon for lunch I wanted a light breakfast and coffee. I ordered the Irish oatmeal which came with berries and cinnamon. \n\nService was alright in the beginning but towards the middle and end it seed like our sever didn't want to be \""bothered\"" by us. He didn't like that we were drinking a ton of water and coffee and they needed to be refilled. We weren't finished eating and he dropped the check off. That is a huge pet peeve of mine. \n\nThe oatmeal was meh. It was watery and was super plain even with the berries and cinnamon. The serving was tiny maybe 1/2 a cup. I know I wanted a light breakfast but it wouldn't even fill a kid's stomach. \n\nPrice for the oatmeal was $9.00 and drip coffee was over $4.00! Come on I know it is Vegas but geeez."
1,"This is hands down the best instruction in the cleanest environment. My entire family participates in several classes offered here. Moses is the finest tumbling instructor possible and his kettle bell classes are phenomenal. Quinn provides top notch ballet, jazz and tap instruction. Beyond their tremendous skill and knowledge, they are the friendliest and most thoughtful people and business owners you could hope to encounter. On my baby's first day of ballet Quinn quickly ran in the back and sewed up her new ballet shoes. Moses often stays late and let's my oldest daughter's tumbling class run long just to provide encouragement and to keep trying. You would think amazing and selfless instruction such as this would cost a small fortune, the prices are so reasonable and they do it for the love of it. Their passion inspires others and that's priceless to me. The facility is beautiful and well kept. I would give more stars if possible!!!!!!!"
0,"Oh my.....I am a Cirque \""addict\"" and try to see every single Cirque show but this was a huge disappointment.   I am glad we went only because I now hear it is closing the end of the year (my review will clearly explain why) and because I love Elvis.  Let me say  this show was so cheesy that I expected to see mice scampering in the aisles.  That being said, there were some good qualities.  I thoroughly enjoyed the video footage of Elvis that is shown throughout a lot of the show.  The dance numbers were amazing and feature many talented dancers however, the actors that interacted with the audience prior to the show were no better than I have seen at amusement park theatrical productions (possibly because many of them are really dancers who have been tasked with acting).  Costumes were fun and I enjoyed seeing them.  The whole show seemed disjointed and it would have been much better had they played more of his original music.  The female singer who attempted to sing several of his more popular numbers literally butchered them to the point that it was hard to recognize the song.  She was a talented songstress but rearranged the melody and lyrics to the point that they sounded nothing like Elvis's originals.  The Cirque acts sprinkled throughout seemed gratuitous and had little to do with \""Elvis.\""  There was a very seductive \""cirque\"" act that was enjoyable but I felt did not belong in this show.  Both the man and woman were very scantily clad and it was very erotic and sexual.  It just did not work with the rest of the show and seemed better suited to Zumanity.  The theater itself is amazing and the seats were extremely comfortable.  We booked the best seating so we were sitting in a comfy couch.  Not worth anything close to what we paid to see it but glad we did before it closes."
0,"Do not come here.  \n\nI was in vegas for our family trip and my family always insists on getting Vietnamese food, despite all the other food to choose from in vegas.  We yelped a pho place, but it was closed down so we found ourselves at Pho Bosa.\n\nWhen we entered the restaurant we were rudely greeted and said we would have to wait for a seat in their small and dirty restaurant.  When we were seated the waitress was also rude to us as well.  To make things worse, they have these signs on their walls that basically states you are not in a fast food restaurant so be patient for your food.  Obviously, if you are at a restaurant there will be a wait and it's pretty unnecessary for them to post that sign.\n\nI ordered bun bo hue which was decent for vegas.  \n\nThe gentleman that came to bus our tables after we ate and he asked me if I like my bun bo hue with a native tone and it confused me for a bit because he didn't look Vietnamese.   In any case, wish we encountered him earlier because he was friendlier than the rest of the people that work there."
1,I found the most amazing vintage flight attendant bag for $18.
0,Do not... I repeat do not.. go here. Owner/manager is condescending unless you are a celebrity's wife
0,The last tome I was in I was waiting for my motorcycle to be finished woth service next door. The wings tastes awful and the fries were clearly frozen store bought. The place still smelled like rotten feet. Later that night I got terribly sick and had diarreah for hours. Clearly the chicken had turned. Will not go back! Truly awful!
1,"I am always on the prowl for a good burger so when I heard there was a new burger place in Tempe I knew I had to try it out.\n\nThe boyfriend and I went to Lobby's on a Friday night. It was not busy but the location doesn't really lend itself to busy. So we were able to walk right in and order. It's an order at the counter and grab a seat kinda place. We both ordered cheeseburgers and got an order of fries to share. I liked that the burgers were not pre-made frozen patties. They threw down two hunks of beef on the grill.\n\nThe burgers were tasty, a nice size - not too big, not too small - and the fixin's were fresh. So was the bun. \nThe fries were crinkle cut but they were crispy and good.\n\nThe atmosphere was fine, good for a quick sit-down and the staff was friendly.\n\nI hope they can survive in this location because they are worth a repeat visit for sure."
1,"Tooo much food.  Can't... breathe...\n\nI'm not sure if it was just our wonderful hyper foodie waiter, or if they treat all their customers this way, but dinner became an EVENT.  He insisted that every dish was bottomless. \n\nWe did the Classic Family Dinner:\n\n3 Appetizers:\n   - Spinach & Artichoke al Forno - Very rich, creamy, and flavorful\n   - Sausage & Peppers - Delicious, but why is this an appetizer??  \n   - Bruschetta - Great flavor, but eat it fast or the lovely buttery bread gets soggy and ruins the fun.\n*BONUS App compliments of the chef for being a new customer?*\n   - Crispy Zucchini Fritte -  How on earth did they make it so breaded and crispy?  I make fried zucchini all the time and it never turns out this good...\n\n4 Main Courses: \n   - Beef Tenderloin Medallions - FANTASTIC!  It was served on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and topped with crispy thin onion rings. YUM!\n   - Chicken Parmesan - Nice and crispy.  Just your basic Chicken Parm!\n   - Chicken Tortelloni - Eh, not great.  Maybe it was the intense flavors of all the other foods that made this taste so bland, but It wasn't our favorite.\n   - Spaghetti & Meatballs - There is actually only one giant meatball.  That \""s\"" at the end is misleading!  Tasted good, not the best spaghetti I've had, but did its spaghetti duties.\n\n2 Desserts: \n   - Strawberry Pie (Special of the day) - I thought I had no room left, but I still scarfed this down.  Light and perfectly sweet.\n   - Apple Crostada - AMAZING.  So crispy and delicious.  Warm under a large scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Heavenly.\n\nI'm pretty sure I need to say some prayers and ask forgiveness for my gluttony.  I blame our server.  He kept sneaking more food on our table to \""give us our money's worth\"".  \n\nI think I need another nap."
0,I threw up after eating here. Very unpleasant.
0,"I wanted to see why people like this place. Really? I got my order in Spanish and the TV had some obnoxious soap opera en Espanol so I had really high hopes for this place. Then I opened my box and was like WTF? You know it's not a good sign when you feel the grease in your mouth before you even touch your food.\n\n I ordered a chicken quesadilla and a taco with rice and beans. The quesadilla felt like it was prepared by a 10 year old white girl who decided to use her mother's left over grease from a week ago to experiament with cooking for the first time. The taco was whatever. My Bulgarian mother has made more authentic tacos than that. The beans were good, but if they fucked those up I'd be worried. They have them premade in cans. Sure, the portions were large, but what happened to quality over quantity? I blame my negative reviews due to my travels. If I had never traveled to Mexico or didn't seek out Mexican food frequently, I probably would have loved this place.\n\nOh also, customer service....forget it. Nobody smiles here. They're probably pissed they have to eat their own food on their lunch break though so that's why I give this place two stars."
1,"My husband and I were staying in Arizona for only a day and had a craving for Mexican food. Looked up restaurants near by and came across this whole in the wall. As we walked into the restaurant we were dubious to order but we've always known that hole in the walls tend to have the best food and this joint was no exception. I ordered the asada gordita and my husband the chorizo and asada tostada with a side of the mini chorizo quesadilla. Hands down this has been the best Mexican food we have eaten and even being from LA. The food was fresh made to order and did not taste of grease like other Mexican foods. Another upside was their affordable prices. The only downside is their small menu selection, but their tasty quality food makes up for it. If you are in town please give this modest hole in the wall a try! You will honestly not regret it!"
0,"If you're looking for an inexpensive drink option, you can get both a saki and beer combo for under $5.00.  \n\nSushi was okay; not great, but not terrible.  Cucumber salad was sweet and I prefer more vinegar.\n\nService leaves a lot to be desired.  I have dined twice.  On both occasions, waited to get drinks, refills, and anything you may need after initial meal delivery.  Service is slow.\n\nWe sent a dish back this time and the server was pleasant and voided the cost of that dish.  We ended up getting something different and it was just okay!\n\nOne last note, where I'm from, they don't include wasabi in the sushi but instead only offer it on the side.  This place actually puts wasabi in the rice and or sushi ( we confirmed this with the waiter since I had never seen this done).  If you don't like wasabi, ask for them to leave it off the dish!"
1,"Great food - a hidden gem!\n\nI'm surprised this place is not busier. We've eaten there on a few occasions and each time its been as great. We've sampled many of the items on the menu and they consistently make a good tasting meal.\n\nWell worth the trip, parking is easy and the prices are right!"

0,"Famous Dave's reinforces the thought that chains suck. I had such a bad experience back in April 2011 when this location opened that I didn't go back for awhile. 14 months later I finally decided to give them another try and place a carry out order. \n\nThe person who took my order over the phone was nice and helpful. Apparently there is a special website: famousdaveslv.com that has the local menu on it which differs somewhat from the national menu. After taking a look at it we settled on mac & cheese from the kids menu with a side of spiced apples, Texas Beef Brisket with spicy mac & cheese and cole slaw, and a BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side of Wilbur Beans. $29 got us three little black plastic boxes and a styrofoam cup of milk for the kids meal. \n\nSo when we get it home we open the bag up and we're looking at $30 worth of food and we're like where's it at? Appearances / non-standard portion sizes aside, it didn't taste much better and all the Rich & Sassy sauce you can smother it with didn't help. The brisket was over cooked and tasted like double corrugated cardboard. The spicy apples looked like someone dumped a big spoonful of spice on top and it looked bad and tasted like crap. The BBQ chicken? Awful! Bleech! Boring, flat, I thought this was BBQ? It sure doesn't taste like any BBQ I know! And being from Kansas City, one of the 4 established American capitals of BBQ I know BBQ. \n\nI could go on and on but the fact is the dog ate well last night with half the brisket going to him, my 2 year old ended up spitting out the mac and cheese and the apples, and pretty much everything else ended up being put in a nice 30 gal plastic trash bag for Republic Services to take it where it belongs. The landfill. It was so bad I found myself thinking Sysco's horrible \""BBQ\"" meat - just add their special food service sauce\"" would have tasted better than this slop. \n\nI promised my wife that for as long as we live in Vegas, I will never ask her to have Famous Dave's again. Ugh, why did I torture my family by thinking this would be any good? They deserve better, and so do you. Don't go here.\n\nEdit: After finishing writing this review I looked over at the dog bowl and the brisket is still there. He even moved it out of the way to get to the dog food under it. Seeing that I created a new list: Even the Dog won't eat it. And my dog likes almost everything so this is kinda weird when he won't touch it."
1,"This is the only indoor mall worth visiting in the West Valley. \n\nFood court is above average. Gotta love having choices like Johnny Rockets and Orange Julius.\n\nGetting my shop on here isn't half bad. When I'm not stuck in ties and slacks, I know I can visit spots like Aeropostale or Pac Sun and dress it down on the cheap. If you're looking for electronics, they've got that, too, with a massive Apple Store, as well as Radio Shack. \n\nSo if you want a clean, convenient shopping experience, make this your stop. Except for Sundays...ugh...the parking lot is horrendous."
0,Average food - had the worst service last night from a young man.  We were the only table in the restaurant at 8:15 - our server was rushing us out

0,"So here it is, I took advantage of a Groupon for thier cleaning service, and in anticipation of them doing a great job, I booked thier service for a weekly reoccuring service.. if they had worked out I would have retained that reoccuring service...\n\nSkip to the day of the cleaning, I had scheduled for 3 hours between 4-7... I recieved a text that the cleaning \""professional\"" Teresa wanted to come by earlier (3:00), as my children get home from high school at 2 pm I advised this was fine. The website stated that the professional would clean the kitchen, livingroom, both bathrooms and all three bedrooms wihtin the three hour timeframe (which was the highest number of hours available). \n\nWhen Teresa was cleaning she told me that she is typically a Carpenter and not a cleaning professional, due to the Groupon they were over booked and so she took the job from the professional who typically works in the area. Teresa told me that she could only clean the living room kitchen and one bathroom and that If I wanted all the bedrooms cleaned I would need to book a 6 hour service... 6 H O U R S..  \n\nWhile I was happy with the cleaning in the areas (except she failed to dust anything) that she did do, I obviously cancelled my reoccuring service and will never use them again. I use the word professional because that is what I expected.. BUT not what I received..."
0,"I have given them chance after chance, the only reason I return is because my wife and kids don't seem to mind the cold food that they serve here. \n\n  At Breakfast time I have attempted to order the sausage burritos. In return I get an item that is nearly room temperature. The cheese has not even melted by the time I get it.  I experienced this at least  on the last 3 occasions.\n\n  At lunch I ordered a simple #1 meal.  I received a cold burger. I took it back to the register, where they did apologize. But in return I got another burger at the same room  temperature. What gives? I would have been happy if they would have just nuked the first one for a few seconds. Burned yet again.\n\nThe staff don't look like they want to provide any customer service, let alone exceptional customer service. I will be avoiding this location from now on."
1,"Pita jungle is pita jungle is pita jungle. They're all the same, No matter which one you go to. They all have the awkward hipster  staff members and the food is the same at each one. Beyond that the food is always good and I appreciate they're being a healthy alternative on this side of town."

0,"I worked out at this gym for a little under a year between April 2012 to March 2013. I had recently moved to Phoenix from the Chicago-area and had been a member at my local Y in Illinois for 5+ years. \n\nI'm not sure if my Illinois-based YMCA is just super nice and I had become spoiled, or what the deal is, but I found this Y disappointing.\n\nI went in for a tour and membership info when I first arrived in Phoenix. The membership fee was around $50/month, which I found outrageous for the shape this place is in. It's older (though apparently recently renovated?), small exercise rooms, and a maze of floors/hallways/stairs.\n\nI knew after touring the place I couldn't justify the price. I later found out that the Ys in the Valley participate in the fitness program through my medical insurance, which is $25/month -- that is the ONLY reason I decided to join. I signed up for my insurance fitness program, and presented the information to the Y. That, in and of itself, was a nightmare. I won't go into that in this review, though, since I joined at the Christown YMCA, and it wouldn't be fair to blame the downtown location for their issues.\n\nBack to my review of the downtown location. When I first started coming regularly, their water machine was broken. Two weeks later, it was still out of order, and I have no idea how long it was not functioning before I joined. \n\nI generally take group exercise classes at the gym, and this location offers a decent variety. Which brings me to my next issue -- the instructors. The ones I've had are generally OK, though I don't think the kickboxing class is nearly the great workout that everyone seems to think.\n\nHowever, I will say that on one memorable occasion when I arrived to take a Spin class, I asked the instructor (politely) if we could please turn on the fans in the cycle room since it is tiny, has no air flow, and gets HOT as Hades. He replied, \""I don't use fans in my class.\"" Wow. I have never experienced such rudeness/arrogance from a class instructor anywhere previously or since.\n\nI really love supporting YMCAs and helping the community, but I don't think I could justify the cost of this one in exchange for the facilities & service."
0,"Vdara is a gorgeous hotel and in all honesty, I loved our room, but two things really turned me off to it...so much that I don't think I'll be coming back. #1 Housekeeping never showed during our three day stay despite having had pressed the house keeping button. We paid the ridiculous resort fees for what now? No service and no clean anything. The front desk was busy when we called btw, so we didn't get through to complain. #2 The lack of self park services is just plain stupid. I kept my head screwed on straight through the first two 20 minute waits for valet to retrieve our car, but after checkout, we had to wait a whopping 45 minutes in the cold with our luggage. THAT IT RIDICULOUS. How does management see this on a daily basis and not address it? Either hire more valet guys or enable guests to park their cars. What a waste of our vacation time."
1,"You know what I love? Nice eyebrows. In this town trying to find an esthetician who knows what they are doing is like trying to find a good stylist in this town (meaning needle in a haystack). I went to Ken Vo's salon, 3 other upscale salons, and was never happy with the results. They were always too far apart, too thin, not symmetrical and I could go on and on. I tried threading and my eyes watered like a baby because it was too painful for me no matter how good the result. So I said, look at reviews! So I stumbled upon this place and thought it can't be bad if the whole place specializes in waxing!\n\nI showed up 15 minutes late because I got sidetracked, and the appointment in front of mine was already there. So the receptionist said I'd have to wait. I said, of course. It was my fault to begin with, so no problemo. I went down stairs, got a frappe, and waited 15 minutes. My esthetician came out and introduced herself and walked me into a very minimal and clean room (love that it was super clean). I laid down and we chatted a little, and she was very easy to talk to. I told her about my bad experiences before (Chola eyebrows included) and she laughed then started working on my 'brows. She was very quick, efficient, and it was probably one of the most painless waxes i've ever had. She gave me a mirror and ta-da! Eyebrows that matched, weren't too thin, and symmetrical. I was so happy! She asked me about my plans for the rest of the evening and it kind of felt like talking to a girlfriend. I was too impressed by how comfortable I was and her technique. I walked out paid my $16 and felt like I finally found what I have been looking for for 3 years in this town.\n\nWax in the City gives you great prices, friendly service, great technique and best of all, none of that uppity attitudes a lot of salons provide. Thanks to everyone there for a great experience. :)"
1,My family and I were in town for my nieces college graduation. The waitress at Joes Crab Shack told us to try Poppys because it was last call at Joes (that's how we roll). Being responsible and not driving intoxicated we walked down and was not disappointed. Fran was very accommodating to our party and even opened the kitchen up for our late night munchies. We were introduced to Poppys Punch which I highly recommend and it was nice to hang out on the patio. We had a great time and intend to drop in again when we're in the area.
0,"They make their espressos with really old coffee. What resulted was one of the sourest espressos I've ever tasted. Avoid.\n\n** Update **\nI've just received a message from the owner refuting that they don't use old coffee and that I would not be able to tell unless I have access to his order forms.  Fine, I can't PROOVE that old beans were used, but that's certainly what it tastes like. If you like drinking sour espressos, this is your place!"
1,"Came here for breakfast and ti was wonderful, I enjoyed a mimosa and some incredible pear French toast.  Service was very good, I will definitely come here again"
1,"We arrived in Montreal Sunday around noon and took to Yelp to find a good spot for lunch. As we quickly found, we're staying right across the street from Chinatown. With the advice of the Yelpers we went here for what were supposed to be amazing dumplings (spoiler: we were not disappointed). \n\nIt was busy, but a table opened just as we arrived. The service is lacking, but this is a really casual place and we weren't in a hurry. We ordered #20 boiled, those are the shrimp, pork, egg, and leek dumplings and the #2 fried, those are the pork and mushroom. \n\nThe #20 were incredible, a light but flavorful taste and the boiling was the perfect choice. The dumplings didn't have that watery feel you get in some places either. The fried pork and mushroom arrived next and were a good counterpoint to the light #20s. The fried bottoms had a nice texture and went well with the flavors, but we agreed that maybe we should have ordered them boiled. They were still quite good. I keep thinking about picking picking up a few ordered just before we leave to go home."
1,"Yoko Sushi is the best place I have found since moving to Vegas a year ago. The fish is ALWAYS fresh and the conversation with Ryan, the head chef, is fantastic. After the first 2 times coming here he remembered my favorite roll (Happy Roll). It's truly an all you can eat place which WILL accommodate your desires."
0,"The food is very good and I liked the atmosphere.  If you go for happy hour be very careful where you sit and then still ask the server.  We had a group of people on Wednesday and sat at a patio table only to find our table did not get happy hour prices.  Had we sat to the right of us at the bar or to the left of us at a different table, we would have saved about 50% on our bill.  Even the manager would not override it.  They said that we sat at a private table, this table was sandwiched between the front entrance gate and the front door of the restaurant, nothing private about it.  The waitress never mentioned it or suggested that we sit at the other table."
1,"This is a good joint.  Very outgoing, the staff really does seem to care about getting things right.\n\nThe first time was average enough that I waited a good 60 days before trying it again.  Good pizza, small pizza's, excellent ingredients, wonderful soups, by the way."
0,"Food was decent, but the service was simply awful.  Our waiter literally left us feeling like we were intruding on his evening.  Seriously?!\n\nFor the service alone, I would not go back."
1,"Great food, great people. The staff is very friendly. The networking event was awesome. Guest were networking and passing out their business cards. Located in Westgate, it is a great location surrounded by stores a water fountain and more. The store manager Cody is the best.........."
1,"Anytime was highly recommended to me by a family member. My garage door had previously broken twice and my home warranty sent out two different companies who obviously didn't get the job done right. Anytime came out immediately, on a late call (after work for me), were nice and helpful and able to fix what the other company didn't. They also replaced my garage door motor with theirs and it's so very quiet, which is a big help since my bedroom is right above the garage. I'd use them again and recommend them to friends and family! \n\nAlso, keep in mind that you can ask your home warranty to use their company (which is what I did, after the first two unsuccessful calls). I wish I would have known that sooner!"
0,Dominos is dominos. But when I walk in and order and watch my pizza be ready for 40mins. I had to stand up and ask them to look at the name on the box an hour after I ordered. This dominos is slow. Drive 5 miles out of your way if you want it. Edit: our soda was flat. Seriously go get Ian's or drive out of your way for dominos don't go to this one
1,Very good. Stoked on this place. Great atmosphere and the food was delightful.
1,"Great place to watch football, they have tons of tv's everywhere! They have a great deal for domestic pitchers $6.75! There food and service is really good too. However, it is hard to get good cell phone service in there, so that's a little disappointing."
1,"This is by far the BEST, smoke shop, in town. The prices are great. The selection is gynormous. The customer service is unbelievable! Whether you are looking for vape supplies, hookahs, lighters, all natural supplements or even birthday & Christmas gifts, this place is a MUST! They even carry hand made, all natural, scented candles, body lotions, fabric skin and air fresheners. My favorite scent is the Citrus Basil. I don't need to worry about toxic chemicals or inhalants. These products are eco, child & pet safe. Even better still these items among many others are locally made by local residents. Let's support our economy by supporting local business. Thank you, Phil & the gang for supporting your community :-)"
0,"The food was mediocre at best. I would argue the food at IHOP or Denny's is probably better. Serving size was appropriate... A little skimpy on the gravy for my country fried steak and eggs, not that it would matter, or was pretty bland but it did help to moisten up the meat. A lot of my friends were complaining about their dishes. I tried my friends steak flavor gum. It was very stringy and rubbery, probably USDA select grade. Another friends salad was frozen... Frozen... Probably made too early and stuck back into the freezer to keep it \""fresh.\"" \n\nNow the service was the final nail in this coffin. We waited a very long time for water. About half an hour before we even met or waitress. And more waiting to place or order. Even longer to even get our food... At some point I was wondering if we were ever going to get fed and had to ask them to check on our orders. Granted we were a group of 14, it was the absolute neglect or acknowledgement that we were there that bothered us. They refilled our small glad of water a few times, barely refilled the coffee for people with coffee. It's like they felt they didn't have to do anything because they got us on the group gratuity so they didn't need to work for it anymore. \n\nWhen the orders were brought out wrong we tried to fix it among ourselves and the wise got angry and snapped at us. It was truly and unpleasant experience."
0,would give zero stars if I could. place does not give two craps about the customer. go somewhere else and be treated with respect.
0,"So, I'm pretty sure I got ripped off here. From the prices listed on the website, kalbi tang ranges from 9-11 dollars. With tax, it shouldn't be anymore than 13 dollars. Having just moved to the PHX area from SoCal, I was hardcore craving some Korean food. A few weeks back, I scoured yelp to find this place. I ordered the Kalbi tang to-go and was charged 15 dollars. I was a bit surprised at the price seeing as cost of living was so low here but happily paid while giving a tip to the lady working the front because I didn't know any better. I went home, opened up my mediocre soup and continued to stew. 15 dollars was a lot for the soup I got. Something didn't seem right. I went online and low and behold, the price wasn't right. I think the lady charged me extra because she thought she could and pocketed the difference. Horrible!!! So not a fan of shady practices and this place seems to take the cake. I really wish she hadn't done that though. I would have been an excellent customer seeing as choices for Korean food are limited in this area."
0,Everytime I've come here the last four months or so it hasn't been the same. The flavors are watered down and bland and disappointing. I used to love this place :(
0,"I've been there twice now.  The food is decent, like those tacos!  But the service...SLOW!!   Most of the TVs are on OTB, which is not bad, but I'd like to see more then one game to watch.  I probably won't be back, although the Friday Fish Fry sounds tempting..."
0,ehh...no.
0,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I ordered a chicken fajita and it was hands down the worse I ever had. The chicken was extremely dry flavorless and chopped up into teeny tiny pieces and was mixed with slivers of onions and peppers. The worst part was the warm goop that I assume was guacamole based on the dark green color. It had the same flavor and consistency of the sour cream. Last but not least, the horchata was watered down and gritty. This place is definitely no bueno"
0,"Yikes! I had high hopes for this place, and I was disappointed.  The customer service was awesome, which is what the 2 stars are for.  The food was not good.  Less quality then Subway.  I got a vegetarian sub on wheat.  The bread is horrible.  no strong and thin almost.  The veggies were ok.  My mayo was kinda warm? blahhhh! Not very good at all, I will not go back."
1,"My friends and I enjoyed the food and service. The place could use a, \""refresh and update\"" but I enjoyed it overall. The food alone was worth it. The desserts were homemade and spectacular."
0,Do not shop at this location.  My wife and I went in last Saturday made our purchase and set up delivery for today. I just called the store to find out that not only are our goods not coming today our delivery was rescheduled to next Saturday without any notice.  I will be canceling my order and never shopping here again.
1,"Definitely one of my favorites with some interesting holes. Warning though, it will take 5 hours to play but worth it. Nice views."
0,"I've driven past this place dozens of times and wondered if they were any good.  I found the existing reviews inconclusive so we decided to drop in for dinner one evening.\n\nWhen we arrived we immediately liked the outdoor area and the warm decor inside.  \n\nA couple came in behind us and we inquired if they had been there before.  They replied that they had and we asked if it was good.  The husband shrugged and uttered, \""Meh.  It's gringo.\""\n\nWe stayed and shared an appetizer and an entree.  We were served a small dish of frijoles and a small dish of salsa.  To our surprise the frijoles were rather hot.  Not terribly flavorful, just spicy.  The salsa was ok and spicy as well.\n\nAs if to continue in the same vein, our enchiladas arrived and the filling was very spicy.  Again, not terribly flavorful, just spicy.  We had one pork enchilada and one beef enchilada.  I couldn't tell which was which for sure.\n\nThe tacos el carbon appetizer that we shared had so much fresh, raw onion on it that we were tearing up and picking it off.  Strange.\n\nWell, now we know and we won't wonder about it when we drive by but we certainly won't be back.\n\nI like spicy food that is flavorful not just hot for the sake of being hot and nothing else going on."
0,How do they get 5 stars? My fianc\u00e9 was disappointed as well. The funkiest looking pad Thai ever.
0,"First off, if you're interested in fitness, real, honest to god get-in-shape, look good naked, fitness, this place is not for you. If you are looking to markedly improve your cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, coordination, agility, balance, *and* accuracy, this place is not for you.\n Their free weights are stuffed in what some other fitness clubs would consider a closet. If you know what a clean and jerk is, and you go to this club, you're in The Village's 1%. Even the pool was a disappointment. It's not for laps, it's for moms to sun and read magazines while their kids splash and fart.\n Don't get me wrong. You *can* get into shape here. But you *can* get into shape in your backyard. The cost of joining up could buy you a great set of Olympic weights, a pull up bar, new shoes, a weight vest, a kettle bell or two, a jump rope... But you wouldn't be considering a club if you wanted to get fit in your backyard and buy all your own equipment.\n\nNow, if you're into tennis, this place will accommodate. I think half it's footprint is set aside for courts.\n If you're into pretty girls in full makeup wearing their brand new Lulu Lemon Yoga Pants (and believe me, it's ALMOST worth joining for this particular scenery), there's plenty of that. If you're into orange dudes who won't sweat because it'll muss their hair and they simply spend toooo much on product to deal with that, then this place is for you. If you dig stepping on french fries the aforementioned farty kids dropped on the floor while chasing each other and screaming while wearing a full set of Under Armor compression gear that costs an average person's car payment, you'll dig this joint. If you're into a place to pretend you're into fitness and \""be seen\"" then you should join up tomorrow. If you want to the cashier at AJ's to notice your latte cup with \""The Village\"" emblazoned across the front while you buy your parakeet four cases of Fiji water to bathe in, then this place is for you. \n \n There are some people here who are in great shape. There are some people who are flat out awesome to chat with. The customer service is nice. I would club baby seals for some of the girls here to star opposite me in a romantic comedy.       However, all of the positive aspects of this place are not involved with fitness. They're recreational, hang out, be part of a scene type of pluses. If you're willing to pay for that, then saddle up partner. But if you want to be taken seriously when you say you \""work out\"", by people who actually do, then you don't work out at The Village."
0,Jerk salad is small and not good. Maybe try a wrap? I am sure this place is best for wraps and smoothies not salads.
0,"I used to think Mojo was fine until I began yogurt-quest 2010 with my boyfriend. Now that I've tried a lot of other places, Mojo has gone to the bottom of my list. They do have a variety of flavors, but the yogurt taste and texture just doesn't quite do it for me. Something is slightly off. Mojo is doing something right with their branding because they do get quite a following. The crowds at Mojo are yet another reason for me to patronize other smaller places: shorter lines and places to sit."
0,"I came here for lunch because I wanted something healthy and light. I ordered and the girl was not very helpful with my questions I asked when I was ordering at all and she never repeated my order and she  never gave me a receipt! Then 45 minutes later I get my smoothies and she gave me 3. But I only wanted 2 and they tasted like water. Then I finally got my food which was the new turkey bacon ranch sandwich. The food was dry, there was no turkey on it at all and it was awful. I will never go back again. And if I could give them zero stars I would."
1,"It's not about quantity with the brunch/lunch buffet, but it is about the quality. I haven't been happier with a quality buffet for $22.00 ever. We went on a weekday and actually savored the food. I'm known for ground and pound on some of buffets, but this was not one of those times. Almost everything comes in its own serving dish, bowl, etc., so that means less mess too. I got a complimentary Bloody Mary with the meal (you get that or a Mimosa). \n\nThe salad bar has quite a few choices. We tried their Caesar, and a few others. All were tasty and really fresh. They had some amazing salami's, and Italian meats, as well as shrimp cocktail that is portioned out with two shrimp and sauce. \n\nThe fried chicken wings were crispy, yet juicy and perfectly seasoned. The red beans and rice were flavorful and brought back memories of Louisiana. The fish was perfectly prepared, moist yet cooked thoroughly.  The Asiago stuffed gnocchi was amazing. The macaroni and cheese was exceptional with bread crumbs on top. The only thing I wasn't too amazed with was their Chinese food, so pass on that.\n\nThe dessert bar is crazy. They have 18 flavors of gelato and you can ask for really small scoops to maximize your tasting adventure. \n\nThis was the best buffet I've had in Vegas for the price."
0,"You can serve me terrible food.\nYou can mix me a crappy cocktail. \nYour ambiance can fall flat. \nYou can even charge me more than I want to pay.\n\nBut take note Tempest (and really any other business in Madison and beyond) you can't be complacent. I mean you can, but I will not patronize your business nor will I recommend it. \n\nWhen you turn the lights on, polish flatware and open your doors you are entering into an agreement with those that are coming to spend money that you want their business. But after 4 visits and an event that I unfortunately brought 28 people out for, you have done nothing to make me think you a. want my business, b. care to make money. So I have to ask... why show up to work? \n\nTonight was the last straw. My friend and I were sitting at the bar for ten minutes before someone came over not to ask us what we wanted to drink or to show us menus, but to stand there. To stand there and look at us blankly until we asked if happy hour was still going on. He said yes and lobbed the conversation back our way, didn't go over the happy hour specials of which there are many. I felt terrible for suggesting we grab light bites and drinks to this friend who had never been to Tempest. \n\n*flash forward*\n\nI'm not eating sugar right now and the brown sugar sauce that tops their scallops is entirely too sweet, so I asked for seared scallops with the bacon lardons that typically top the dish but not the sauce. I explained if the kitchen wasn't interested in accommodating my request and leaving the sauce out, I'd find something else. Surprise, the scallops came out with the cloyingly sweet sauce and this is how the next few moments went:\n\nBARTENDER: Yeah, I said just the scallops and lardons, so maybe they can't separate the lardons from the sauce? \nCOREY: Ok, well I don't eat sugar, so I can't really eat these, there's no way to get just seared scallops, no sauce?\nBARTENDER: I mean, that's what I asked for, so I guess they can't do it. Did you want these? \n(I'm sort of fuming at this point)\nCOREY: No, I mean I can't do the sugar so....\nBARTENDER: They'd be on the house.\n\nGO TO THE KITCHEN AND SAY THESE CAME UP WRONG, CAN YOU SIMPLY SEAR SCALLOPS AND PUT BACON ON THEM? What's the challenge here? \n\n*flash forward some more*\n\nDrinks went empty, food was eaten, and it took forever to catch someone's eye to get refills or order more. Why? Because it was more important for a gaggle of servers to talk with the bartenders about what a proper wine pour looks like. I counted 5 at one point staring at the same glass of white wine, then repeating this behavior 15 and 25 minutes later. So detail oriented.\n\nLast up, the gent that cases the joint, a manager I assume, does laps around the restaurant every time I've been there, but never asks how we're doing. And that's really the crux of my issue. I know full well a business can't be 100% \""on\"" 100% of the time, we all have bad days. But when leadership at the top has no vested interest in how people spending hard earned money feel about their establishment, that trickles down, and I want no part of it. \n\nThere are plenty of restaurants in town that serve seafood by people who are interested in striking up conversation, making menu recommendations and righting wrongs that may occur when things go awry in the kitchen. I'll go to those places, a giant wooden boat and tea lights don't do it for me."

0,"This chapel is ghetto and incompetent. They charge extra fees for stuff, and charge WAY to much for pictures and your not allowed to take your own pictures inside the chapel, which is bogus since your paying so much to get married there, in our case have your vows renewed there. They also CHARGED us 50$ to have my dad marry us! Why? Who knows, its not like they had to do anything extra to have my dad stand up there. We also went back the next day to buy the overpriced 90$ dvd of the marriage, waited an hr and they still could not find it, had to leave and they said to come back later cause they were open till midnight. We came back around 930pm and THEN they decide to tell me, after waiting another 20mins, that the dvd guy LEFT FOR THE DAY!  I asked if they could call me and let me know if they find it, since they said they record all the weddings yet my mother in law clearly heard them say they werent recording ours and we dont get a dvd, they told me no they could not call and never gave a reason which is all bull. They have crappy customer service and RUDE incompetent people on their staff."
0,"Last night I had THE WORST movie experience of my life. I'm better off just listing everything one by one\n1. The wait to get into this place was probably longer than any concert I've ever been to. You would've thought there was a celebrity inside or something. I was with my sister and we were in our car waiting for 50 minutes to get in. There is only one way out and its forwards thru the cashier's booth at the end so we were stuck with no option but to keep moving forward. \n2. Despite arriving early before the movie was supposed to even show we decided to stay (since we waited so long) and watch the last half of the movie until the next showing. The only reason we did this was because the drive GETTING OUT was just as bad as getting in. \n3. There is no organization whatsoever as far as the layout goes, drive roads, or overall theater layout. The theaters were so packed close together that I could hear the dialogue from every single movie playing. We were that close to each other. \n4. In the same note, parking in the theater lot was next to impossible because the space was not properly utilized. It was a free for all parking scenario. Drive thru's when I was a kid had properly marked spots (like any parking lot) this place had none.  Once we parked we basically got locked in behind an enormous van that blocked half the screen. Not only should the theater lots should be properly marked but should probably be on a sloop to ensure everyone can see the screen. \n5. At the end of the first showing (which we missed half of, remind you) as soon as cars started leaving we moved closer to the screen to ensure a better view. Awesome, right? WRONG! Didn't matter where we parked because there were screaming, yelling children running amok. the noise level from neighbor cars was just outright annoying not to mention we could still hear the noise from the other movies. Should there not be walls, gates or something acting a sound barrier between each theater? \n6. The second showing of the movie was supposed to start at 10:30 (because we had missed the first half of the first showing we were going to stay and wait to see the second showing) but it didn't start till about 11:20 and even then we had no warning until 11:10 We had the station they played the audio for the movie on the whole time. Between movies they played indie which is fine but it wasn't until 11:20 that we got an announcement on the radio from the theater employees saying they sorry for the inconvenience but because there were people still waiting to get in the theater that the movie would be starting late.\n7. About the last 20 minutes of the film it just cut off. NOTHING no MOVIE! The screen went completely blank and people started honking like crazy. Understandable, however, extremely annoying. It did start back up again after a few minutes but at the beginning of the previews then it went back out again. \n8. At that point we decided to just leave. As we drove silently away we became very confused as to where the exit was because people apparently were parked in the poorly paved/marked road that led to the exit. We had to drive our car thru a labyrinth of parked cars, people in seats and children running around. Of course we got dirty looks from people because.\nEven with the cheap ticket prices (they only take cash) double feature options (which we didn't use but were excited to know about going in) and the comfort of our own car and snacks (we never bothered with the concession stand, we're not that adventurous) there was absolutely NO redeeming qualities and I would not suggest going to this place unless they do a complete overhaul of EVERYTHING."
0,"I'd like to preface this review by saying that a rating of 2 stars is based on service and service only. The food I had at this bakery was quite good, but the lady serving ruined my experience. I don't expect mile wide smiles everywhere I go - but at least neutrality is a must. \n\nI walked in with a friend. She ordered only tea and got a skeptical \""is that all look\"". I got a tea, sandwich, and eclair. The eclair was heaven on earth. I would recommend their baked goods any day. The sandwich was OK. I asked to get it warmed up and mentioned I didn't like cold meat. When I got it at the table, my meat was cold. I walked up and politely asked to have it reheated.  When I got it, it was burnt to a crisp. On top of that, the lady sarcastically asked me if the sandwich was *still* too cold, that I should bring it back again.  That really irked me. She didn't have to say anything. She could have put it down and walked away. I was saddened by my overall experience. I recommend this place for taste only - or if you avoid getting the female server."
1,"what a find. nice plating and great food. the BAO is the best. you need try that. UNREAL. thanks for YELP that we find this place. service is great. have beer from asia, it is great place to have BAO and beer, BURGER is super. make us want to come back tomorrow. it is that kind place. PLEASE come and you will be happy....."
1,"Just stopped in here for the first time. New coffee lady, Sherry, was super friendly and made a delicious dirty pumpkin chai. Great for fall! My friend got a caramel mocha latte. It was also really good and decently priced-only $3.25!"
1,"I was pleasantly surprised by this location. I wouldn't call Rubio's \""authentic\"" by any means but if you are looking for a quick fix for your taco cravings it will do the trick.\n\nThe food is pretty good. I adore their poblano and mushroom tacos. Not many places serve veggie tacos so this makes me happy. These tacos are stuffed with grilled poblanos, portabellas, fresh avocado, cilantro, and queso fresco. Plus the taco shell has cheese crisped on to it. It is a surprising and tasty twist. \n\nI have always liked their beans and before I discovered their tacos I would get a plain old bean burrito.\n\nMy husband always gets fish tacos or burritos and always says they are good.\n\nTheir salsa isn't the best but they have a few different kind of varieties.\n\nPortion sizes are kinda flimsy especially their side items...\n\nService at this location is awesome! The lady running the register is sooooo nice and seems extremely competent.  \n\nThey also sell beer which is nice for a fast food establishment. I haven't imbibed yet because I always order takeout but I saw a sign that said all beer is $2.50 in the evenings. Hmmmm... I might have to come back for that.\n\nGive Rubio's a chance- they might surprise you."
1,"My favorite things about symphony hall is how much culture to which it is actually a performance home. The ballet, the opera, the symphony, and more. \n\nYou need not look further than symphony hall if you are in search of something to bring some depth and beauty into your every day life. If you have a student ID you can get tickets to performances for $10 immediately before the start of any performance. You fill a seat basically. You may have great seats. You may have not so great seats. The point is that you get out and get some culture in your youth at a very low price. Fill your life with beauty and culture. You will always find something worth while filling the space at symphony hall."
0,"\""What's that smell?\"", my daughter asked as she wrinkled her nose.\n\""That, my dear, is the scent of government assistance\""\n\nHey, I'm no snob (but it's rumored that I'm a jackass), and Golden Corral really does offer unlimited ribs... but I don't see the benefit in having unlimited ribs when you don't care for the taste or consistency of them.\n\nIt's cheap food, and a lot of it, but I'm not a pig (although I do have my times), and I don't want to feed from a trough."
1,One of the best breakfast joints I've ever eaten at. Had blueberry pancakes with almond orange butter. Breakfast ciabatta sandwich nicely rounded out the salty portion of the meal.\n\nMust go when you're in Madison.
1,"Great place! The food is great and a good value. \n\nIt's owner operated and you can tell they really care their customers. But don't expect a bunch of Rasta's working there with Reggea blastin in the kitchen;) They are a very nice, clean cut couple. It's in a strip mall so it's not the \""coolest\"" location. It's fairly hidden back behind the Starbucks. \n\nBut if you want to try some great food that's just a little different than the norm, check out Starlight. Mrs. Brown is great about letting you try a sample before you place your order. \n\nFYI - if your in a huge rush, they tend to operate on island time ;)"
1,Only two surprises about this place.\n\nThe price was less than we thought and the food was as good as any cafe in Milan.\n\nJohn
1,"I love this concept:  healthy breakfast/brunch/lunch on-the-go.  I tried D'lish this morning for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised.  I wasn't expecting much from a drive-through establishment but they delivered a hot, yummy breakfast, coupled with a chai latte that was probably the best I've had to date!\n\nDon't go expecting the speed of fast food drive-through.  You will wait a bit but it's worth it because the food is that much better.  I tried the breakfast burrito with chicken sausage, wrapped in a warm whole wheat tortilla.  I enjoyed it.  What makes me happy is that there are several other breakfast and lunch items that look appealing to me so I know a repeat visit is in my future."

Just keeping it real!"
1,Guacamole bacon jalape\u00f1o burger with mango salsa... tickles my tongue just thinking about it. Chili cheese fries are a guilty pleasure.  Been here a few times and they always have something different on the menu.  It's very clean and the staff is fast and friendly.  Love supporting local businesses!
0,"Chicago Joes Blows!!  The exterior of the building looks inviting like an old home, but the inside is a different story.  It is uncomfortably dark, dingy, and extremely cramped.  We ordered chicken and eggplant parmigiana for entrees and had a salad to start.  The salad was good, nothing special there.  The entrees were horrible.  The chicken parmigiana was a meager piece of overcooked chicken with the frying batter smeared on top topped with what seemed like a pound of half melted cheese.  The eggplant tasted as though it spoiled a week ago, yet they served it to us.  The marinara sauce for both entrees tasted like it was the scrapings from the bottom of the burnt pan from the previous day.  Trying to salvage a bleak meal we ordered a cannoli in hopes it would redeem the experience.  Sadly this was not the case.  All in all this was a big disappointment and a waste of money."
1,"The Marksman Bar is very much an old traditional Leith Pub which is full of characters . In the Best Bar None awards they have taken a Silver Award for the last three years which I can assure you is very difficult to achieve. The charity work that is done in this wee small community bar is amazing, so much so that the licensee of the premises won the Unsung Hero Scottish Licensing Award in November 2013. Some of the customers look rough and ready but you should NEVER NEVER  judge a book by its cover, they are actually Rough Diamonds. There is always a warm welcome to strangers.  It is a small pub, spotlessly clean, with very reasonable prices."
1,"Although I'm  big fan of the Southwest Caesar salad as it is my go-to lunch here at NYF, I tried the NYPD burger today. Your choice of 1/3 or 1/2 lb burger on that buttery bun with the smokiest blue cheese crumbles I've ever had. It was delicious! I love that everything here is made to order and to your specifications. I love that the staff is friendly, courteous, and go above and beyond to make your meal special. The new menu boards are up as well and they look fantastic! \n\nPlus--did you know about the kids' menu? Yep--NYF now has kids options as well! From kid faves like Mac N Cheese to hot dogs, sliders to chicken fingers, this menu offers some great kid size choices for even your finickiest little New Yorker. \n\nOh and if you follow them on Facebook, they will run Facebook specials from time to time to keep things interesting. \n\nAll in all, a very fun mom-n-pop restaurant tucked in to Surprise that you don't want to skip!"

1,The service is a little slow when you first arrive but once you get to the table everything is fast and very polite.
1,If you can't find what you want in this store then you really didn't need it. There are plenty of items to choose from the inside of this large store. It is clean and I have had no problems w/ any of the sales staff.
0,"We went to GR's P&G this afternoon for lunch and, I won't ask forgiveness for being blunt, this place was absolutely terrible and the only black mark on an otherwise perfect tour of Vegas' fantastic dining experiences. \n\nI must also say that we have very forgiving natures when it comes to restaurants, and that neither of us are food snobs; we simply like good food, whether it's from a proper gastro-pub or from a fine restaurant. This of course was neither. \n\nI ordered the little sliders (I forget already what they called them, having all day tried to repress the memories). I don't mind paying good money for good food or for good quantities. These sliders fit none of those descriptions. Each was as small as a silver dollar, greasier than anything from a proper pub, and to be quite honest flavourless save for the strong garlic butter the came with. A \""plate\"" of three of them cost 14 dollars. The \""chips\"" were greasier than a fast food place, were not crisp, and flavourless to match the sliders. These little greese-bars were nine dollars alone. \n\nMy charming companion tried the shepherd's pie. Being the verbally generous thing she is, she could only say that the dish wasn't terrible. A 22 dollar bowl of tripe is not what you'd expect from a fancy chef's establishment. Having tasted the pie myself, I could not be so forgiving in my description as her, nor could I really come up with something intelligent and so instead made, I think, an awkward face upon tasting it. \n\nThe one thing I will say was pleasant was the service. The hostess was very friendly, and the server was rather attentive and pleasant. This, combined with the fact we were terribly hungry when we arrived, was the only thing stopping us from walking out. \n\nAgain, I must point out that I am not snobbish when it comes to food. This place was terrible for cheap food, let alone for something this expensive. In our time at Vegas, I have eaten fantastic burgers at \""I Heart Burger\"", \""The Grand Lux Cafe\"", and KGB (Kerry's Gourmet Burgers\"" . . . Each of these phenomenal burgers were cheaper than my tiny little sliders and had flavors I cannot even describe. If you feel the need for a good burger, I would recommend any of those. \n\nI feel I must end this review on a positive remark . . . their little symbol of the Union Flag within an English Bulldog was cute."
1,I went to this Dairy Queen a couple weeks ago and the employee working at the drive through window noticed I had dogs in the back seat of  the car so he made them each a doggie sundae with vanilla soft serve and two dog biscuits. What a nice gesture! I left very impressed with their customer service. I recommend this place!.
0,I switched with them thinking I could save some money by bundling my package and get the same type of service I had before. NOT!! The internet service is a joke. Maybe its because I live in Fountain Hills. They shouldn't even offer the service here.
0,"Traditional 70's style Italian-American food in a strip mall mainly notable because you can bring your own wine with no corkage fee.  Don't believe the hype - this place is nothing special.\n\nContrary to the many reviews here that comment on how cheap it is, I found it a bit expensive for what you're getting, which is not exactly nuova cucina.  $15.95 for two small (non-homemade) cannelloni a la carte is not a bargain in my book.  Their linguine with white clam sauce is some canned clams tossed with a copious amount of oil (1/2 a cup perhaps) and some boxed pasta for $12.95.  The $9.95 \""insalata Romana\"" is a plate of tired iceberg lettuce, a tomato wedge or two, and a few shreds of bland cheese swimming in a very tart vinaigrette.   \n\nThis is the kind of food that used to represent Italian food in America before the food revolution of the 80's.  The kind of place you'd find, not in New York or Chicago, but in Terre Haute or Tampa at a time when \""eye-talian\"" food was still considered a bit exotic.\n\nThe many reviews stating that this is \""real homemade Italian food\"" are a bit puzzling since it's neither homemade nor Italian.  This is very old-fashioned pre-foodie Italian-American food and while it's OK for what it is, it certainly isn't \""real Italian\"" food by any stretch of the imagination nor is it, for the most part, homemade.  \n\nN.B. No, a visit to this restaurant is not \""just like going to Italy.\""  For that matter, it's not just like going to Little Italy.  I realize Phoenix is not exactly a mecca for italian food, but WTF people!  \n  \nThe mostly 60+ crowd seems to love it.  I can only guess that they are overwhelmed by nostalgia for a simpler time, because while it may not be Kierland pretentious nor a crappy chain restaurant, the food just isn't very good.  Seriously. \n\nThe servers have a strange attitude that I guess is supposed to be \""east-coast\"" or something (rushed, cocky, borderline rude) but seems a bit out of place in what is basically a mom and pop strip mall joint serving canned food with plastic red checked tablecloths and thin paper napkins.  In any case, they are very selective with their attention and you can wait quite a while to get something.\n\nAlso, as several other reviewers have pointed out, they give you a non-itemized bill with just the total due written on it which seems to include an extra 10% or so with no explanation offered.   This seems quite bizarre to me but apparently no one objects.  At this restaurant, $15.95 + $12.95 + $9.95 somehow add up to $45.65.  The non-itemized bill is a weird affectation at best - why would you do that, especially in a cheap joint like this?  But to do that and then mis-calculate?  There's a word for that in Italian - it's imbrogliare. \n\n$54 for two with tip for a simple shared salad and two pasta dishes with no meat and no drinks."
1,"The National Museum of Scotland is as informative as it is interactive!\n\nBoasting exhibitions that take you from the Bronze Age to the present day and beyond, there is something to suit every interest and age group. They had a life sized NASA rocket and loads of old artefacts last time I was here.\n\nThey seem to have a range of exhibits that are as good at representing older ways of living as much as showcasing the changing pace of technology. But my favourite parts of the museum are the sections that concentrate on Scottish life through the ages. There are some great, insightful pieces to be found, from an interesting video reel dedicated to Scottish migration to memorabilia from Scottish music artists! I loved seeing the old Apollo programs and sneaking a look at the seats from Scotland's old music venues. I was also captivated by their detailed accounts of Scottish scheme life since the 70s and loved the quirky homage they play to the notorious Edinburgh graverobbers, Burke and Hare.\n\nWith a cafe, shop and staff all around to help you throughout your museum journey, you could easily spend a full day in the National Museum and never get bored. What's more, it's a free day out! One of the best museums in Edinburgh (if not the whole of Scotland), you'd be mad to miss it."
1,"I'm not sure I've ever been to a place where pretty much EVERYTHING on the menu looks delicious. \n\nUntil last Saturday I had never been to Husnu's. I went with my dad who had been their numerous times and has gotten something different each time and loved every dish he got. \n\nThe place has been around since the late 70s. And the reason is obvious. They have amazingly good food. Not only do they have a wide selection, but I'm sure ALL of it is GREAT. \n\nI ordered the Kabak Dolmasi (Acorn squash filled with chicken topped with tomato sauce and cucumber yoghurt sauce). The squash was soft and buttery. The chicken was SO tender it almost melted in your mouth. The sauces made for an almost creamy mixture when combined. Even the yellow rice (saffron?) was amazing. Nice flavor and could compliment any dish well. Needless to say, I loved it and ate every last bite. I was extremely full afterwords, maybe even overly so, but it didn't matter. It was just that good. \n\nThe service was perfect. I didn't feel watched over, but by no means ignored. The waitress was very nice and added to the overall pleasant dining experience. \n\nIt's a great restaurant during any season. Their food has a warm and rich flavor that would compliment any fall/winter day. Sitting outside to enjoy one of their many salads would be a great way to spend a spring/summer afternoon.\n\nOf course I'll be going back to Husnu's (hopefully in the near future). And you should definitely give it a try too!"
0,"Walked in Monday was greeted with less then a welcoming feeling.Asked about the facial and wanted to get one but  they did not have the time I wanted til Thursday.So I booked it and then told I had to put a credit card on file to hold  the appointment.I did not feel comfortable doing that and I said can I call to see if you still have that spot open on Thursday? No the employee said I would have to walk in to get the appointment,I said no way I can't call?? No she says.Walked out and later found out the facial would have cost me 109.99 for a 60 min facial by a student that just graduated from esthetician school.I can get a 60 min facial from Aveda for less then 100.00 by a spa manager.(over 10 years experienced!) The prices are so over the top for what they offer and who gives them.I don't like the way you have to be a member to get the better price.Needless to say I will never get a service there because how the front desk acted and how Massage Envey operates."
0,"I knew it wasn't going to be the Venetian, but I didn't know that black oil-like substance would spew from the tub mid-bubble bath...\nNo one knew what it was, and I really don't believe they ever even looked into it. I asked them to leave us a message letting us know what they found out, I was curious to know what it was that I was sitting in for a minute and I never heard about it again.\nOf course they offered to move us out of that room so they can fix it, but I actually had to ASK to be upgraded to a better suite. That should have been offered. No one at the front desk seemed apologetic, or even surprised, which was concerning. \nThey need to be a bit more thorough with their cleaning, there were body hairs in the bathroom when we were first checking into the new room.\nTwo stars for the upgraded suite with a big whirlpool tub that I definitely appreciated."

0,"We've frequented this restaurant a number of time with friends and even brought out of town relatives.  Since changing from Trophy's, we've seen a change in service, but unfortunately our visit on Saturday will cause us to most likely not visit again.  \nWe placed our order soon after our drink order and saw table after table getting their food served.  At first, we didn't think much of it because we were having a good time catching up with friends, but then when our waitress started getting concerned with the time, we looked at our watches and a good 50 minutes had passed.  Two of us ordered burgers (which are very good), one patty melt and one order of lamb.  Mind you two tables that came in after us, with larger parties had already been served food-- one of those tables was at least a party of 10.  \nBut you know what?  We were having a good time, so we were going to let it go.  They finally brought out our food and the waitress apologized numerous times and said the manager would be out to talk to us.  My friend dug into his lamb which was WAY to rare and sent it back... then we asked to see the manager.  After waiting another 25 minutes, having the waitress come out another four times and ask if the manager came out to see us, we were pretty upset.  The last time the waitress came to our table, she advised us our entire meal would be comped.  \n\nNow, what kind of manager doesn't come out and speak to his/her customers?  We didn't want our meal comped (except the lamb), we wanted to talk to the manager.  Instead, they comped the meal, embarrassed our waitress and lost our business.  We certainly didn't hose our waitress and tipped her very generously as we felt bad for the whole thing... They wanted to change their name for marketing purposes.... well the manager better get their act together and put their customer service hat on.  That is what the business is all about after good food.  Come on!!"
0,"First off, love Wild Thaiger, food is excellent, service is by in large prompt, courteous, and a relaxed atmosphere. \n\nHowever, I had a bad experience, where I witnessed a cockroach walking across the bar in front of me. I voiced my concern to Ola, she couldn't find it. But apologized. I was dissatisfied with this response and wrote her an email expressing my concerns. This is her appropriate, professional abbreviated response.\n\n\""As a regular you know we have an \""A\"" rating because we don't have a pest problem.  I will be glad to share the pest inspection reports and monthly service schedule for the last eight years which we have been in business.  It would be a perfect world if I could afford to have enough staff to open all of our boxes in the parking lot and stock all of our products individually to ensure that unwanted pests do not enter our doors. Of course we have discontinued purchasing product from the supplier and they are aware of the problem.\""\n\nShe refunded my money, and we're satisfied, moved on. \n\nI show up today with my party---and she pulls me out of the restaurant, tells me that \""i'm not supporting her business\"" and that a few days after my email she gets an inspection from the Maricopa County Health Department, and they gave her a \""B\"" rating. She proceeds to accuse me of calling them, and blaming me for her low grade. I inform her that I dealt with her straight, communicated directly with her, and I considered it resolved. At this point she tells me she won't serve me anymore after being a customer for about seven years.\n\nHaving never dealt with the Maricopa Environmental Services, I'm not really aware with how they schedule their inspections but clearly it was a coincidence that it occurred 6 days later. I guess Ola never thought perhaps it was a different customer, or in fact that maybe it was scheduled every 3 months?\n\nAt any rate her reaction to customer feedback is not only unprofessional but just makes bad business sense. \n\nPoor decision Ola, I'm really surprised your sanitation problem, and failing an inspection is blamed on your customers."
0,"I've been to several buffets in Vegas, but I think it is safe for me to say that Wicked Spoon was my least favorite. I even tried this place twice! Both times was pretty A-OK for me. The food isn't bad, but it could have been better. I wasn't able to fully satisfy my intense pig-out sesh, because personally, I didn't see that many foods that I wanted to reach for. They had all the basics like meats, pasta, dessert, etc but other buffets had a lot of seafoods such as shrimp and crab legs. \n\nI don't think I'll come here again... Both experiences were not worth the money personally for myself."
1,"A wonderful dinner experience at this beautiful restaurant! Everything was PERFECT! We have been to the lounge before, it was fun, and the dining experience this time was even better! \n\nThe elevator to Mix restaurant and lounge was scary, it was meant for dining people to see some amazing views on the way up, too bad I am scared of height. Passed through Mix lounge, lovely host girl let us choose a window booth or a bird nest booth, was it a bird nest? Or half egg shell? Either one I guess, I liked the bird nest, it was more private, comfy and fun.\n\nWe brought our own Perrier JOU\u00cbT champagne, our server put it in the ice to cool it down. I ordered a raspberry lemon drop martini to sip on while we were looking through the menu, very clean and simple menu, I could tell every single item on the menu must be so good. And I was right, the dishes we tried were AMAZING! \n\nStarters: \nComplimentary bread basket: assorted breads with butter and peanut butter, very delicious, loved the peanut butter! \n\nShrimp cocktail: non traditional shrimp cocktail, it was like a salad, jumbo shrimps were so fresh and tender, they tasted so good with the tomato sauce on the bottom, the sauce was so flavorful and delicious! \n\nBroccoli soup: clean flavor, with a hint of cheese in it, it was yummy. \n\nEntrees:\nLobster curry: one of their signature dishes, our server's favorite, he said he didn't even like curry, neither am I, but the curry flavor was fantastic! It was not heavy, just rich and flavorful, small amount of coconut to add a hint of spice, tender lobster meat with exotic flavors, it was MAGICAL, I loved it so much! \n\nFilet mignon with jalape\u00f1o pepper: the first cut came out overcooked to medium, they changed another one for hubby, the second one was a perfect medium rare, bloody and juicy, exactly what hubby liked. The red wine sauce was so good, the jalape\u00f1o was extremely spicy, server said it was from Santa Monica, most of them aren't spicy, guess hubby just got lucky to have a super spicy one on his plate, but both of us love spicy flavor, we didn't mind. Hubby loved his steak so much. \n\nSaut\u00e9ed mushrooms: with housemade creamy sauce, delicious mushrooms, the flavors were so strong. \n\nFrom appetizers to entrees, the food was amazing! The flavors were heavenly delicious! Chef worked magical exotic flavors on each dish, how did he do that?! Just WOW!\n\nDrinks:\nOur Perrier champagne was so tasty, loved it, the raspberry lemon drop was strong and yummy, Chef's complimentary coconut and passion fruit souffl\u00e9 was very very tasty, I usually don't like coconut flavor, what happened that night, how did I come to like curry and coconut flavors? \n\nAfter so much rich and flavorful food, I had no room for desert, the portions were big, both hubby and I got so full. Chef made us mini cakes with hot fudge as a little treat, just to apologize for overcooking hubby's steak, they were yummy. Hubby had double shot of espresso to finish this lovely dinner, I had the rest of the champagne by myself as usual. \n\nDefinitely one of the best dining experience I have ever had for a very long time! The restaurant was beautiful, the views were amazing, the food was spectacular, the service was flawless, it was just PERFECT! Worth every penny of the $300 tab! The cork fee was $35. \n\nMix has just become one my favorite restaurants in Vegas, along with Comme Ca and Circo. I think I've just had my next Vegas trip dinner dates lined up, that's awesome! \n\nPs. The lounge next door offers champagne bottle service on the patio, it's a great place to enjoy the night views of Las Vegas while sipping on champagne, very romantic and relaxing."
1,"The Sushi's shimmering sign caught my attention so I finally made it a point to check this place out! The decor inside  is nice an calming with their tall booths.\n\nI don't often go for the \""all you can eat \""sushi because my husband who typically comes with me doesn't eat \""that stuff\"". I hate pigging out in front of him while he eats a salad but I had to this time. The price was cheap 20.95 for all you can eat but I knew I couldn't eat more than two rolls. It was still cheaper than buying them separately though. \n\nI had the Vegas Roll and the BBQ Roll. I love when places put meat on sushi rolls . It feels like a mini surf and turf meal! I love it! My husband may not like sushi but he couldn't  walk away from dessert . It was pretty cute and refreshing on a hot night!"
0,"Terrible.  This is a true story.  I go to Zipps to meet up with my husband and our friend who are partaking the waitress finally comes over I ask her what is in her Zipps-a-Rita and she said, \""We pour it out of the frozen machine, then if you want to add extra alcohol you can.\"" Not my thing.  Instead I asked her if she had a lighter margarita with less sugar, I finally just ordered limes, club soda and tequila (a Nor Cal Margarita).  She looked at me and said, \""That's disgusting.\"" No joke.\n\nDude - I don't want all the processed sugar that comes out of your shitty frozen drink! And I shouldn't have to justify my drink order to the waitress.  Now when I get a light margarita at any other bar it comes in a 16 oz glass.  This came in a high ball glass. This was a drink not a mixed shot.  \n\nShe did come over and apologize, as I was leaving.  Looking around at the time I was there it was filled mostly with people over 50, the bar was 75% men.\n\nMy husband and his friend were over charged for their burgers but they did not complain because they got good prices on their beers.  I am sure that soon the novelty will be gone and they will raise a stink about being over charged on food.\n\nBottom line - if you want to hang out with old men and bitchy waitresses, Zipps is your place, but its not for me."
0,"The place was packed on Sunday for lunch. Might be people going out from Sunday church. The green salad was dressed in lightly sweetened ginger sauce. The pan fried shrimp pocket were really good. I just wish they have a special sauce as dipping instead of just plain soy sauce. As entrees, we got the chicken and vegetables which came out cold, might have been that the chef forgot to put it first in the microwave. We returned it and the waiter said he will check with the chef. But what is there to check. So we told them to change it to grilled chicken instead. The manager (I guess) came to us and said the grilled chicken will take a while and said maybe because of the weather that's why it got cold. But the other entree Ma-la shrimp and chicken was steaming hot. Anyway, the grilled chicken came steaming hot and with barbeque sauce. All in all the food is at least 3 notches up from your normal chinese buffet on a scale of 1-10 (buffet=4). The food is priced reasonably for the quality. Service is just fair."

They sit there and ask each other for help. I don't know what that is all about. Do they get paid or this is for credits? \n\nThey make you fill out paperwork and then send you over to the cashier. The cashier knows what they are doing at least. Then the cashier gives you a piece of paper, saying you paid for your test and then you walk back over to the front desk to show them the piece of paper. Is anyone following how time consuming and old fashion this is? \n\nOk so I move to a different address. I know I have to be there early so I can change my address before my test. I give proof of address with a bill in hand but they say I don't need that. So then I give my I.D. to them which also has my new address on it. He takes it and goes scans it, I guess to put it in my file. They make me filled out new paperwork. Then once that is all done I head to the testing room, and even tell the teacher I have a new address. She writes it down. On my test, it asks if I had any changes since my last test, and there's a option for new address. I check it. I even filled it out on the test. Now I am pretty confident my results will get to my new address.\n\nOne month later, I still haven't gotten my results in the mail yet. I was patient enough and decided to call to see what was going on. The young male adult that answered the phone kept putting me on hold to look for my test and when I took it. \n\nSo he finds my paperwork and starts reading off my old address. I started laughing in frustration. I explained what I went through, that morning to make sure everything was going to be sent to me. I wasn't mean or nasty with him.  laughed a lot thought because I couldn't believe this was happening. I asked if he could changed it over the phone and that was of course no. I must go back to the school and change my address and also get my test results there too. \n\nSo my scanning of my I.D. was missing, and all the new sheets I filled out were just gone? He also tells me that he would of remember scanning my I.D. because he was there that day of the test. \n\nI hung up on him. I couldn't take it anymore. He made me look like I was lying. How frustrating is that. \n\nSo I am still in the unknown about my results. I haven't been able to make it down to the school since I don't have a car. It's really not easy to get to in my situation. \n\nI am finding another school quickly. Will not give them anymore of my money!!  \n\nThanks CSN for all the drama."
1,"Came across this place on a whim, but glad I stopped in. Defiantly has some unique burgers on the menu. I went with a pork and beef burger with Chinese sausage on a Taro bun. Also had some mushrooms on it. Good flavor and the taro bun actually had taro flavor to it! Bad part of the meal would be that the fries did not come with the burger, everything is ala cart.  I liked the sauce that came with the fries. Would recommend anyone to come here that's going to Vegas."
1,BEST dam night ever!!! Double decker party bus was sick! And the clubs were insane! Def worth the $$ And host are amazing! Jessica was great! This is a MUST if you are in Vegas!!! Can't wait to go back and club crawl!!
1,"As others have suggested, the green chili is fantastic.  It really is the best.  \n\nTheir beans are very good too.  Not too salty like other places.  \n\nI wasn't overly impressed with their tacos though.  It wasn't bad, just that I've had better.  When I go back (and I will be back!) I'll pass on the tacos, but that just leaves more room for green chili burros."
0,"Tonight was one of the insulting, pathetic displays of customer service we have had.  \nMy wifeis Gluten Free, and after clearly stating this to the server, and ordering a supposedly \""gluten free\"" item (grilled mahi mahi on corn tortillas), they served the tacos on flour tortillas, and continued to insist they were corn tortillas.  The manager finally got involved and admitted they were flour tortillas, and the menu has a mistake.  For a Celiac, this is a pretty big mistake and can cause severe problems.  At this point, there was really nothing left to order except sashimi.  She also added on a salad, at which point the server asked if cucumbers are okay for gluten free!\nClearly this restaurant needs to better train the staff on what this means.  The manager was also very unaccommodating and unapologetic.\nUnfortunately this is a place with decent sushi that we will never be in again due to their complete incompetence regarding accommodating special dietary requirements."
0,"What happened here??\n\nWhen I was here for dinner a little over a year ago, the buffet (the matter paneer in particular) was fan-flippin-tastic.  Service was great, the food was amazing, and I swore an oath to myself that I would somehow come back here.\n\nI was in Vegas with my fianc\u00e9 this past weekend and, even though he's not big on Indian food, I talked him into having dinner here because of how good it was.\n\nWomp Womp.\n\nDid they change ownership??  There's no such thing as a dinner buffet anymore.  \""Well, I can't eat embarrassing amounts at the buffet, but at least I can order the matter paneer off the menu,\"" I thought.  There was one nice host/busser, one food runner, and one disinterested waiter, which got to be a problem as the dinner crowd picked up.  The naan was sub-par; more burnt air bubbles than anything.  My beloved matter paneer was totally different.  It wasn't bad.  Actually, it was pretty decent, but nowhere near as good as it used to be.  We sat at the table, done eating, plates cleared, for a loooong time before I was able to practically tackle the waiter to get our check.\n\nHad I never been here before, this would have been a 2.5-rounded-up-to-3-stars-to-be-generous experience.  But knowing what was and what could have been, this mostly left me disappointed and apologizing to my fianc\u00e9 for misleading him."

0,"MGM Signature: Where COMPLIMENTARY means you will be CHARGED\n\nOverview:\n\n- Room was put on hold for me for my Birthday  \n         - Was informed it was a Full House\n         - Was informed there was never a room set aside \n         - Was then informed I should have come earlier \n           (which I did 2x but could not get to a front desk attendant)\n\nMr. Gonzales, mgr, informed me that they had a \""full house\"" with \""no available rooms\"". He left it at that and I gather he hoped I would go away. I informed him that this was completely unacceptable and unprofessional. If I was not to have a room, do not promise one to me. \n\nMr. Gonzales offered to send Strawberries, Champagne,  Wine and a $50 Dining Credit to my room.  I requested late check-out and Mr. Gonzales agreed to 2pm to compensate for our delayed check in.\n ________________________________________\n\n- Complimentary Strawberries & Champagne in new room\n          - Room was given away\n________________________________________\n\n- Was told there were no rooms available   \n          - Waited for me to leave the front desk\n________________________________________\n\n- Indicated to the mgr that this was not a professional way to handle  this matter\n         - Offered a new room\n________________________________________\n\n- Complimentary Strawberries, Champagne and Wine  \n         - I was Billed upon Check-Out\n________________________________________\n\n- Complimentary $50 Dining Credit    \n         - I was Billed upon Check-out\n________________________________________\n\n- Complimentary Late Check Out    \n         - Front Desk attempted to Bill Me\n\nThe front desk called to \""inquire\"" what time I was checking out. I said 2pm and she thanked me and informed me that I will be billed a $30 late check-out fee. I explained that Mr. Gonzalez said it was alright and she responded there were no notes on the account\n________________________________________\n\n- Old Food Served for Room Service   \n        - Room Service refused to remove off bill\n\nThe Room Service manager (Andrea?) called and wanted to know what was wrong. I explained that we did not eat the food and it was not fresh. She said she would send someone to \""retrieve\"" it so they could \""inspect [it] and show the Chef\"". I asked if it was removed off the bill and she said no, not until they retrieve and inspect. This made me feel dissatisfaction for the service and also like a low class citizen, as if I could not be trusted.\n________________________________________\n\n- Provided me a Bill (for Complimentary items above)  upon check-out\n\nIn the Lobby, I saw Francisco whispering to a gentleman. Upon approaching the front desk, this gentleman introduced himself as Warren Sprague, manager. He apologized for my inconveniences and helped me check-out, handing me a bill for $223.84. I asked him what the bill was for and he explained it was for my room charges. I told him I had no room charges and asked for an itemized bill, he said he could not provide one. He then asked me to step aside (as he did not wish the other customers to hear) and said he would look into this for me.\n\nMr. Sprague returns and informs me they are charges for \""liquor\"". I asked him if it was the complimentary Champagne and Wine. He said there are no notes on my account regarding anything of that nature. \n\nUpon his return he said today was my birthday and he did not want me to leave the MGM Signature upset so this is what he will do for me: He will clear all my charges and I will leave with a Zero Balance. Thank you for offering me Chocolate Covered Strawberries, Champagne, Wine, $50 credit, Late Check Out and charging me for it! The MGM Signature billed me for everything after very clearly explaining to me that this will be \""charged to the room and removed upon check-out\"". The reason?: \""there are no notes in your account\"".  So much for a routine check-out.\n\nDisappointed would be an understatement. Put yourself in my shoes for a moment. Something like this should never happen to a customer, much less time and time again with the same customer. How many times should one apologize for Poor Communication in the short span of 13 hours? How could this much go wrong? How did something go from so wonderfully surprising to so terribly wrong in 13 hours? I do not believe I have ever heard the words \""there are no notes in your account\"" so many times in my life, and yet, someone was able to find these mystery notes at a later time. In the past 12 months, the MGM has had 6 \""Billing/Collection\"" complaints reported against them. I now understand why.\n\nCo-workers have suggested that I report this to my corporation as we should not be staying at a hotel which treats customers in this fashion, we shall see. We book there yearly and even rented out Hakkasan for WPPI. Definitely a lot invested there. \n\nI have sent a 6-page formal complaint to Ms. Jill Archunde Santell, General Manager via certified mail (received last week). I am now waiting their response."
1,"I've stayed in W Hotels across the world and this is the best. Great service, rooms, location. Room service is great.  It's close to the other hotels, but far enough removed that if you come for an event that is hosted at one of the huge hotels like the Hyatt, you are just far enough away to avoid the hoopla."
1,"I have many pictures of my four legged kids, most not very good as I can never get them to sit still long enough to capture the 'who' it is that they are.  Christmas of last year, I decided I needed professional assistance and contacted Michelle Pelberg of Cow Dreamz  Photography, (602) 510-1929.  Michelle will meet prospective clients in most any setting as it is her mission to photograph pets relaxed and in their element.  We decided on a local park and met in the afternoon.  Like all great photographers, Michelle snapped away, remaining inconspicuous as my dogs enjoyed a winter day in the great out doors.\n\nI will utilize Michelle in any future pet photography project and happily endorse her services to all interested parties.  She has a knack for capturing the essence of our beloved four legged kids."
0,"If you're into restaurant/bars where 30-something women go to hang out after loudly announcing, \""OMG! Sushi and Martini Monday!\"" after a rough day at the office, then this your place. Or perhaps if you're into trendy bullshit like trying to look sophisticated while you sip your appletini and eat over-seasoned edamame, then Blue Wasabi is your spot. If you're into a tasty, cool and refreshing glass of water to cure that parched palate, then by all means, check out Blue Wasabi.\n\nBut if you're into good sushi, go somewhere else. \n\n2 stars because my water was good."
0,"I was going to give three initially, but then I saw Yelp's descriptor for two stars: \""Meh. I've experienced better,\"" which about describes my feelings; it's a more apt description than three stars, which signifies \""A-ok.\""\n\nTo start, since this is a bar, let's talk about drinks. drinks are very expensive. A beer is $9. This wasn't even a fancy beer I ordered, it was a Guinness. This is expensive for downtown, but would also be expensive for any bar that isn't technically a \""club.\"" I know I've bought a Guinness at bars on the strip for less than $9. Again, this isn't exactly some rare, top-of-the-line microbrew, it's a readily available beer, so I have a hard time paying even $7 for it. But here's the real rub, unlike the bars on the strip, it didn't even look like I got a full pint! I could walk down to the Griffin and get a slightly higher end beer that will, at most cost $7, and I'll be fine with it, because at least it's not a beer I always see on tap at any given bar. Since beers are so expensive here, I've never bothered ordering a specialty drink, maybe they're great, but I'm willing to bet they're also grossly overpriced.\n\nI've seen a couple reviews complaining about bartenders, who seemed fine any time I've order from them. I'd say to look out for most of the bouncers - many of them are rude, kinda stereotypical bouncers trying to prove that they're tough guys. Some of them are okay, usually when they're at the door, but other than that I've never had a pleasant experience interacting with them. Speaking of the door... there's a $10 cover charge on weekends... because they aren't making enough money from the overpriced drinks.\n\nMaybe all the expense is to cover the interior decorations which aren't bad, I'll give them that.\n\nBottom line: Looks alright inside but don't expect to save money compared to just going to any given club on the Strip. Also, avoid the bouncers, even if you aren't making trouble."
1,"If you enjoy hot dogs, get to Ted's ASAP!\n\nTed's is a great place to have a charcoal grilled hot dog with all the sides.  There are other items on the menu (sandwiches, burgers), but I've always stuck with the staple hot dog and fries. One day I will try a burger and a milkshake.\n\nHard to beat Ted's classic meal of a hot dog, drink and either fries or onion rings.\n\nThis is a no frills place, good food, good service and old school charm.\n\nThe place can get very busy! Be prepared to wait in line and/or wait for a table to sit.\n\nI'm a bit ashamed that I never wrote a review of Ted's earlier. I thought I had and then realized I never did. Better late than never."
1,Great burgers!!!! Everyone was so friendly and it was an enjoyable atmosphere!!! My favorite part was that they had orange blooms on tap! AMAZING!!!
1,This place is awesome!!
0,"Just not a fan of Chop and Wok.\n\nIt's been here for years and I remember the food being better when I was a kid.  If anyone thinks this is good Chinese food though, I don't know what you're smoking, but I'd love some!  The orange chicken bowl is the only thing I've had that is decent here, but its nothing to get excited over.\n\nI think the only thing they have going for them is the 1-cent Yelp cocktail and the wide selection of beers.  But the crowd here is a little rough...you definitely don't think you're in Scottsdale, which I guess for some is a nice change.  For me though, it's not a place I want to sit and drink at."
1,"Reasonally priced food for the Vegas strip.  Had fast service and delicous food!  Would highly suggest stopping here if feeling hungry in New York, New York!"
0,"Not a great place to go before a Coyote's game, despite its prime location. As usual, Yard House had a ridiculous wait and McFadden's patio was empty so we headed over there...mistake. Go eat and drink anywhere else. Their service was atrocious and the food/prices don't make up for it. Despite being deserted, we were given a buzzer thing to wait for a table (told a 20 minute wait). We went and sat at the outside bar, which only has 3 beers on tap. After waiting for 45 minutes, we checked in at the front to see how much longer it would be. The lady said she had been calling our names over the microphone...clearly the microphone doesn't work in their outdoor space and the buzzer thing never buzzed. The hostess then told us the buzzers don't work...why give it out then? And why not get us from the bar? Having clearly requested an outdoor table, we were seated indoors. The menu is small and doesn't have much of anything interesting. We ordered onion rings, and a lot of beers. The onion rings came out immediately and based on their sogginess, they obviously had just been sitting out in the kitchen. Beers weren't poured great (small pours)."
1,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon and I was pleasantly surprised by Liquid. Walking in I was a tad afraid I was going to walk into something you see at TAO beach. Thank God it was nothing of the sort. \n\nThey never over packed the place so there was always room to walk around and have your own space. It felt somewhat like a relaxed day at a really nice pool, alas there were still a few crazy people who are doing all the wrong things in a very public place. Seriously, do they know we're staring at them not bc they're hot but instead a hot mess? Children, we are in Vegas that doesn't mean you still don't have a last name that your mom/dad would very much appreciate you not putting to shame. \n\nGrandma set aside, Liquid is a place you go for some good music (a DJ spins) and good food!! I'm not lying when I say their mahi mahi tacos were one of tastiest I've had. I promise if you try them they won't disappoint. Only issue is that they make you eat it at the bar, I'd rather eat it where I'm sitting so I can take my time. I had to throw out one of the taco's bc I didn't have space in my tum. \n\nAll in all the decor is pretty and the place is new and fresh so if you're feeling in the mood for drinks and music by the pool I'd recommend it."
1,"Hands down, the best spa in Vegas. I came in here for some R & R until I saw the gym. Then I decided I wanted to get all pumped up. The equipment is nice and clean. The gym doesn't smell like an abundance of sweaty men. I had a great 2 hour work out. I made my muscles work till they were sore and I felt like I was gonna puke. \nThe spa area itself, you can get a multitude of things from a waxing, baths, wraps, mud baths, facials. Really it's full service. The steam room has scents of Eucalyptus, and the sauna smells like fresh cedar. The whirlpools are so relaxing. Even the water....there's cucumber water or Lemon Water. Everything was so refreshing. Fresh muffins,  selection of teas. You get a bathrobe, slippers, and a bunch of magazines from Time, Maxim, Men's health, etc. Yea I was in the men's side, so i couldn't tell you what's in the women's!\nBut I have this plan to dress like a girl and infiltrate it. I just need to keep working out here to get into a size 2. \nDefinitely a great place to go to relax. If you don't get a treatment. Admission is 30 bucks and it's all day. That means when you get done with your workout in the morning, come back at night so you can get another workout and a relax hit again."
1,"I work right down the street from Kabob Korner so I've def had my fair share of their food - and I LOVE it!  My favorite is the chicken gyro although their hummus is pretty good and so is there chicken and rice dishes.  I got a \""side salad\"" one time but it was enormous - just a warning in case you like to add side salads to your meals.  They are very friendly and will make you custom food too if you ask.  The only thing I wish they had was fountain sodas cuz I hate drinking the ones they have from the can."
0,"I wasnt particularly fond of ice monster cafe. Their interior is pretty nice and comfortable but for quality drinks and snow ice I wasnt impressed. Prices for a small flavored ice was $5 which is served in a very tiny martini glass, large is about $10. I ordered the taro slush sensation, and a friend of mine got the thai tea, green tea float, and mango slush sensation. The thai tea wasnt good at all from what he told me, first he tried it with their sea salt cream foam, but it was too light and then with regular half and half cream. It looked very watered down and he said it was bland tasting. As for his greet tea macha float, he had described as floral traditional green tea but stronger. It didnt honestly look too good, like green water and a plop of ice cream melting in it, like a water float. My snow ice sensation was very bland, the ice cream scoop in it was good but the snow had very little to no taro taste at all; very watered down, and the texture was not fluffy but more of a crushed freezer ice texture, not worth 5 bucks in my opinion. The mango sensation was good and for a large was very decently sized, that was the only redeeming order of that day. The workers were pretty nice but not very helpful or knowledgeable at all on their products, it was more like ordering from a vending machine with no personality or presence unfortunately. I dont think I will ever be back but if I do return, maybe next visit will be better."
1,"This is one of those places that I consider an adult candy store. There is so much selection here that if you don't have an inkling of what you are looking for, you could probably walk out with the entire store (provided you have the budget). \n\nPrices are very good and their staff is amazing! They are so knowledgeable (for instance, I was in the market for a particular petite syrah, and ended up in the syrah aisle...silly moi, they are made from different grapes, and lucky moi, the sales guy wandering down the aisle knew just what I was looking for...without even having to look it up on his computer! Color me impressed. I love it there. He didn't even make me feel dumb for not knowing I was in the wrong place. :)"

0,"I did my research on yelp on vegas buffets prior to arrival.  Since I stayed at the MGM, I thought I'd give The Buffet at Bellagio a try.  \n\ni went on a tuesday, no wait.  went in at 3pm for the lunch price like what the other yelpers suggested to do, and ate lunch and dinner food.  The only difference between lunch and dinner was that they offered sashimi and instead of flank steak, they had prime ribs.  Big whoop.  \n\nMost of the yelpers said it's one of the best buffets in Vegas.  After I started eating for a while, I wondered if I actually went into the right hotel....  To think that Bellagio is one of the bigger and nicer hotels and yet they fail to even make sushi, wow that sucks.  Their super generic sushi is even worse than ones at Safeway.  Heck, even my friends can make better sushi than that!! \n\nThe flank steak was chewy as heck.  the leg of lamb tasted more like duck.  I only went to this buffet a few days ago, and I can't even remember what I ate because nothing stood out!!! \n\nI guess i have to try all the other shitty buffets in vegas before I'll appreciate the wonders of the buffet at bellagio.  until then it's still 2 stars in my book."
0,Overrated... I will not go back
1,"I've eaten at this restaurant a couple of times and there food is pretty good overall. I like the theme of the place...makes me feel like I'm on a tropical island. I absolutely love their bathrooms...I feel bathrooms say a lot about a restaurant. They were very clean, nicely decorated, full size doors for every stall, big size stalls, and they have mouth wash with individual cups so you can be minty fresh as you leave.\n\nThe food:\n\nLobster and Shrimp Quesadilla- It was good but I imagined something different so it was tasty but I felt it was missing a bit more flavor. Glad I tried it but I'll probably go with something else next time.\n\nSeafood Chowder- That was delicious, had a good amount of shrimp and vegetables and was creamy, I loved it.\n\nCobb Salad- It was big and came with the usual fixings but I've had better cobb's in my life. \n\nCoconut Shrimp- Mmm...mmm...mmm...a must if you eat at this restaurant. Perfectly fried and packed with flavor.\n\nChocolate Pineapple Cake- I don't like chocolate but I do love pineapple and this dessert called to me. It was warm, rich, and melted in my mouth. I suggest sharing because it's very decadent...I needed a glass of water when I finished. \n\nThey have a large menu so there's something for everyone and they have a good selection of tropical alcoholic drinks."
0,"So a friend of mine went here last Friday, and they were double charged.  The bartender took advantage of the situation and threw out the receipt to avoid cancelling the $60 amount. Which she claims and assumes was her tip (on a $60 bill). \""I get a 100% tips!\"" umm..yeah.. I think I will skip this place for sure!"
0,"Typical cafe with typical breakfast food. I won't sugar coat, this is barely an inch above Denny's but more expensive. \n\nOur waitress wasn't very good and wasn't very knowledgeable of the menus or prices. When we first walked in there was a sign that read $5 mimosas but the waitress tried to charge me more saying that I was incorrect, finally I walked to the front and asked if I could take the sign with me to show the waitress; the manager happened to be there and asked why, so I explained what happened and she immediately knew which waitress I was talking about and apologized because apparently theres always issues with this particular waitress. Immediately, the bill was fixed and the rest of the time the meal went without anymore issues.\n\nI didn't enjoy my food, it was bland and small portioned. But I did enjoy the mimosa =]\n\nFirst and last time here. Come on Bally's, you can do better than this."
0,"I absolutely would not use this company again after speaking with the manager, Sherry, about the work they did on my exterior signs. I would post a photo on Facebook, but these signs reflect poorly on my business! Poor judgment was used in the size of the lettering in my business name, even though Fast Signs was provided with a copy of our logo. When they could see that the name being inserted between two existing lines would be tiny, they should have realized there was an issue and called us instead of printing these signs without a proof and then quoting me full price to redo the signs! We could have changed the font or authorized them to print it much larger. Justifying a bad decision by blaming the customer is just never a way to get repeat business."
0,"This establishment leaves A LOT to be desired. Table service is extremely poor. Visited on 8/23/13 for a retirement party in the back room where 1 server was assigned to handle the entire room (30+ people) while her apparent sidekick was wiping down televisions. Waited 30 minutes for a drink order from the bar and 45 minutes for mediocre, COLD food. If you are drinking alcoholic beverages, you are far better off getting up and going to the bar yourself. I didn't bother complaining because I simply didn't have the time after waiting so long - and if I did, I didn't feel like waiting for a manager when they probably could care less. This place has great potential, but unfortunately it's a waste -- which is a sign of poor management decisions. Just shut the doors now and save yourselves the trouble. So many better choices downtown than this toilet."

Seriously, the lady who gave us a number did not give us the correct paperwork. We waited our 40 minutes to be called. Angela at counter 20 advised us that we had the incorrect paperwork. Which was not our fault. She then proceeded to argue with me as if it was I who screws this up. She then told me we would have to go back to the first counter to get a different number and wait again! As if my time was not as important as hers. I argued with her and seriously fought the urge to \""pop off\"". She ultimately conceded defeat and walked me up to the first counter to repeatedly point out the First Ladies error. Then she sat me down with Tamera. \nThis is when things calmed down. Tamera is probably the nicest most patient person within 8 miles of this place. She spoke sweetly and explained everything thoroughly. Seriously, she is a valuable employee and made my daughter feel much better about this entire process. Tamera you rock. Do not let this place jade you!"
0,"From September 2010 visit:\n\nDecided to dine here spontaneously after the boyfriend won a bunch of money in the casino. There was a short wait since we didn't have reservations. Once we sat down it took a long while to be greeted. By the time someone came around, we prompted him with questions and were over-eager and excited to start ordering. He told us he wasn't our server. Hmmm ok.Thanks. So by the time our actual server around, we were sooooo ready to order. We all wanted the prime rib. That's what they're known for us course. They were out. Not only were they out, they were rude about it. Like we were supposed to know. Well, if the host had told us or maybe we would have known. Or if they server told us before taking our order, maybe we would have known. Whatever. We got the stuffed mushroom. Disgusting. Didn't know you could mess such a thing up. It was a hard ball of fried grease. Who fries a stuffed mushroom? The rest of our meal wasn't memorable. We spent a lot of money and expected more out of this restaurant. I wouldn't go back. Sad because we enjoyed our stay in the hotel..."
0,"Deals are the same here as anywhere else.  What matters is the service.  And I can say for the table waitressing that they are pretty attentive.  But when it comes time to actually park your vehicle before entering Barney's you are going to have a hard time- mostly because the lot between Barney's and Pita Pit is undefined.  Parking in the back lot risks your car being towed and then neither owner of either establishment claiming responsibility for it.  I was the vicitim of a shady property/tow agreement and Barney's, despite my patronage, made no effort to reconcile the situation.  Beware that parking in their back lot is at extreme owner risk and that no support even with a reasonable argument will be given to the patron."
0,"Now I don't know how many check-in's I have on Yelp, but I've been here a fair amount of times to know what is good and what is bad about this place. This was the first AYCE sushi place I've been to here in the valley and it's not in my top 3 places. To sum it up, Oyshi is so hit or miss that it's almost a risk to come here. Yes, you'll come here see that there's a long wait and expect it to be great but the last few times I've been here and given chance after chance, I've left disappointed. \n\nFirst of all, I used to work in a restaurant. Server's know when it's busy, trust me, and as a customer I expect you to acknowledge that. The times that I've waited for a decent amount of time, I've never been apologized to about the wait or been given an explanation when the rolls I've ordered don't come out when it seems like people who just sat down are getting there's before me. \n\nI'm not that selfish, but I just feel like the service here is poorly conducted. I've felt that it takes a group of us to look around constantly before someone comes and asks if we need anything. The rolls are always very good, but the amount of time that it takes most times I'm there is not average to the sushi places I've been to. \n\nI will admit I do love their Salmon Nigiri and the Love Affair roll but a lot of the other rolls often feel like there is just too much going on. I don't like to complain, but the service isn't up to my standards and my standards aren't extremely high. I just expect my water to be refilled within a decent time and asked if I'd like to order more without having to ask to order more. \n\nI am very forgiving and I will come here, I just don't have the expectations that I once did. The sushi is usually very fresh and the options aside from the sushi are great. I always order the calamari and the surf-n-turf appetizers when I come here. I would recommend this place to a friend, I think I would just advise them to be go-getters with their servers and make it known when they want something. All in all, if someone said they were coming here tomorrow, I'd probably join them. Cheers!"
1,"We had a five-star experience, so came back less than 24 hours later. That one was more like 4 stars, so four it is. \n\nI had the Croque Madame both times. The first time, it was absolutely spectacular. Everything I wanted. Perfectly cooked, egg was runny and amazing. Just delightful. The next day, it was considerably slower inside, but my edges were slightly burnt and my egg wasn't runny at all. A little bummed at the night-and-day from one day to the next. \n\nThe Mexican corn with Oaxaca was pretty awesome. Got it on recommendation of our server the second day, and was super pleased. Outrageously messy, but good. \n\nThe mister got something yummy the first day which I don't remember (but clearly was good enough he didn't complain about going back the next day), and the special turkey reuben the second time. Reuben was interesting - coleslaw instead of sauerkraut. I wasn't totally sold on the idea, but he was happy with it. \n\nWe sat on the back patio until our food came. The swarm of flies was tolerable when we didn't have food on the table, but I spent more time swatting them away and defending my plate than I did eating what was on it, so we moved inside. Sat inside the second day and still noticed a few flies on the window, but the experience was much more tolerable. \n\nFriendly service, tasty food, and breakfast available all day. (Super important to a third-shifter!) We'll be back."
0,"I wanted to give this place a better review. The Cafe was pleasantly full, great tunes, and the waitress was friendly and attentive. Unfortunately we (a table of 2) waited 45 min for our food to never come out while seeing a table of 5, who came in 20 min after us, get served first. The waitress was apologetic but her continued \""your food is coming out next\"" assurance lost credibility when she had to repeat it twice and then servered the table of 5 was first."
1,"This is the most reasonable Sunday brunch buffet on Saturday or Sundays, $25 for adults with tax included. All you can eat steak, omelets,  crab, salmon,  just to name a few. The price had gone up, but what hasn't. Westgate resorts took over from LVH, so far the same. Side nite; not sure how long the status quo will last, but for now it's a good buffet next to the sports page.  Enjoy."
1,Rolling belt of sushi. Lunch time each dish 1-3 dollars. Awesome! Try the baked Scallop Cali Rolls
1,My last night in Vegas on memorial day weekend I headed here with Tiny (Luke) and had a blast. Charles the bartender who made it clear that he only works Mondays and Tuesdays (he is sooooooooo cute...) treated us with such care that I am planning a trip back in July just to go say hi. Overall drinks were poured generously and the clientele was entertaining. Of course by the time we ordered our 3rd cocktail we were getting close to missing our flight and had to slam it and run back to our hotel to pick up our luggage. Unfortunately I didn't get to see the whole Flex scene but hopefully next time.  Would I go back ....oh hells yeah...
1,"On the rare occasions when I go back to Champaign, there are a few places I always need to revisit - the first, obviously, is Dos Reales.  The second is Papa Del's.  Everybody seems to love Papa Del's, and for good reason.  Champaign is not exactly a hotbed of amazing cuisine, but Papa Del's delivers consistently delicious, hot, cheesy deep-dish awesomeness.  There's usually a line, but even on Friday night of homecoming weekend we only waited 30 minutes!  And they had us pre-order our pizza when we put our name in for a table, so by the time we sat down, we only waited about 15 minutes before the pizza arrived.  The beer is dirt cheap (the one thing that makes me want to consider living in a small town), and the pizza really hits the spot.  I'm not a pizza snob by any means - all I know is when I cut that first slice, and the cheese stretches out in delicious strands, and the crust is crispy....I'm a happy girl.  See you next homecoming!"
1,"this was my first time eating bob zip's food but all i can say is i'm impressed. i'm a vegetarian that loves sushi so finding a good  Japanese and sushi place with a lot of vegetarian options is hard, but this place has so options. i had the veggie rolls and they are some of the best i've tasted. i saw a lot of the reviews were negative but i see no reason why. the place is kind of small but most of my sushi orders are takeout so that isn't a problem. i'll definitely be visiting again to try some of their other options."
0,"The food is good but a little pricey for what you get.  \""Small Bites\"" are just that, very small.  Service was friendly but slow (even on a very slow night). The restaurant is Steam Punk themed but there's something about it that just didn't work for me.  I think they might trying too hard with their ambiance.  It's feels like a Disney version of steam punk.  The restaurant was empty when we were there and we though it might be just a slow night in the area.  However, other restaurants in the area (Hussong's, Burger Bar, Ri RA) were packed.  We didn't feel a need to come back to this place in the future."
0,"Saddle Rack meets Las Vegas.\n\nIf you like skanky crowd (middle age ladies who don't act their age, old creepy guys) and don't mind paying the Vegas price for the drinks whilst mingling with them, then Coyote Ugly is right down your alley. \n\nOtherwise, go someplace else.  \n\nI'm surprised this place is still around after all this time.  Is it the free shot?"
1,"I hear some of the complaints of the other posters here, but hey, I have to drive 3 hours to get to the closest Trader Joe's so I am a bit more forgiving.\n\nI love the variety of foods they have, and love to stock up when we can at any location.  No, I couldn't see myself only shopping at Trader's for all of my grocery needs, but it is a nice treat.  They have good snacks, frozen foods, produce, breads, Black Toad (how did I survive with other beers before finding Black Toad?) and their vitamins seem to be a pretty good bargain too."
0,"I continue to eat here when I'm visiting campus, and I don't know why. The sushi is okay at best, and overpriced. The atmosphere is tacky."
1,"It's definitely a good place to stay if you are in Scottsdale. It about a 15-20 minute walk to Fashion Square. It's also close to Old Town. \n\nWe were able to get good savings from hotels.com. I have seen Living Social offers so discounts so there are other ways to get discounts. We were able to save quite a bit of money since the hotel offered a free shuttle to and from the airport. They also offered free hot breakfast that was made to order. There was happy hour from 5:30-7:30 pm. \n\nOur room included a living room, kitchenette, two TVs, and an additional sink in the bedroom. The additional sink was great for my aunt and I especially when we needed to get ready at the same time. \n\nThere is also a Dollar Rent A Car on site. Renting a car is easy, and they do offer an AMEX discount. Concierge was very helpful as they booked our Sedona tour prior to our arrival. Some of the front desk staff were more friendlier and nicer than others. \n\nUnfortunately, the place especially the courtyard area did not look as pretty as the pictures. Although the rooms are nice and clean, I agree with other Yelpers that it does need a renovation. \n\nI recommend this hotel if you are not going to be on site the majority of the time and for the great amenities. Otherwise, if I had the money, then I would stay at resort."
1,"Awesome service, great food, I always get the crab legs and sushi, the honey walnut shrimp is very good also. Get there early for dinner, cause all the tables are full, even during the week. Servers very fast the refill your drinks and take away your finished plates. Will be coming back again. Don't know why there are 1 star reviews on here. Have never had a bad experience at this buffet."
0,"kind of yucky--I debated on whether to do a two or three for the Garage--The restaurant itself is great looking, very industrial--great patio space on Bethany Home.  We went for lunch about 1:30--service was fine, but it took more than 20 minutes for the food to be served and all we ordered was 2 BLT's and a flatbread--and by that time there were maybe three other tables of folks--so they weren't exactly busy.\n\nIf you are going to do BLT's you should do them well--spend a little on wonderful tomatoes and put enough bacon on them to live up to their namesake--for $8--i expected more than a strip of bacon--They also put the sandwich on brioche--which is not the right bread for a BLT--the sandwich needs a dense bread--well toasted to offset the moisture in the mayo and tomatoes--this thing was hard to eat at best.\n\nWhat was really awful though were the fries--first of all the potatoes had no taste and secondly they was a VERY NEGATIVE taste of oil that had been used way too many times--\n\nI have to say a got home after this meal and didn't feel right the rest of the day.  I can see going back to the garage for a drink at the bar--but it will not be on my list for lunch or any other meal  I think these \""mechanics\"" need to go back for some more training on quality."
1,"I found the service here is actually very good. A man greeted me immediately as I walked through the doors and helped me with a to-go order. He was very friendly and actually made suggestions on my order and I had a very delicious pork chop, #42, I believe. My wife asked for bun with pork and eggrolls, he didn't immediately understand what I was talking about but took the time to read my iphone and got it right. Everything was delicious and the order came out in timely fashion. The only downside here, like a lot of Vietnamese places, is that they only take cash."
1,"I ordered flowers from Springtime Floral for our 25th Vow Renewal. I orderd  Bouquets, Boutanaires. Centerpiece, Beautiful Room Flowers and Cake Flowers . The Ladies at Springtime Floral did a Beautiful job. It was beyond my expectations. Beautiful colors of flowers  and orchids. They stayed and decorated the room with Beautiful center pieces. And decorated my cake. The Bouqets were brought to us and the boutainares pined on. Our day was perfect  We had nothing to worry about.\nI will use Springtime Floral for all My FLower needs. Love the Ladies there and I can trust them with making my Flower Dreams come true :)"
1,This is THE BEST popcorn ever! They have tons of different flavors. They will also let you sample the flavors before you purchase them. All the employees are friendly as well. The location is a little out of the way but well worth it!!
0,"We ordered the Surf & Turf Rodizio ($49.95) and the Meat Rodizio ($38.95) figured we save a few dollars by sharing the seafood items.\n\nI was underwhelmed with the salad bar. We moved right onto meat parade. We had Picanha, filet with Parmesan crust, pork loin, chicken - hot and bbq, ham, sausage, turkey wrapped in bacon, pineapple, and lamb... we were served in that order. We repeated the Picanha, filet, and ham. We practically had to beg for the lamb, it took three requests before it was brought to the table. For the most part the meats were good. It was only the sausage that I absolutely did not like.\n\nThe surf consisted of shrimp glazed with butter, scallops in butter, grilled salmon and tempura cod. The seafood was BAD, Bad, bad. I couldn't even choke down a scallop, I spit it out. The shrimp were rubbery, the salmon was nearly jerky and the cod was bland and the tempura was hardly intact. They offered to bring another plate, but we refused. \n\nService was adequate."
1,"How you say YUM in Taiwanese? The food was very tasty, very flavourful and the ingredients  were very fresh.  A great selection of different varieties of main dishes and appetizers.  I loved that you could actually buy a half bottle of wine with dinner at a very reasonable price!  \n\nThe staff was very friendly and attentive and the pace of the meal was very relaxed and well timed.  The restaurant is located in the Plateau area of Montreal and even though it was a bit off the main strip, the place was busy the whole night.  \n\nMy only complaint that I would have to mention is that they charged you for parking in what looked like a auto repair shop that was closed for the night that was right across the street from the restaurant.  I figured that if you're spending what I thought was a decent amount of money for dinner, that even if they were being charged by the business, that they could spring for parking to make the experience 5 star worthy.  \n\nI'd still go back but might spend the extra minute or so to find a parking spot on the street."
1,"We purchased a used 2011 Volvo C30 two years ago.  I have taken the car in now three times at the recommended service intervals.  The last time I was in, I had a pretty rotten experience with the service advisor, and when I went in this time I was 'armed for bear', expecting another rude confrontation.  Luckily my service advisor was Brandon Bonds.  Brandon was very polite and professional.  He complimented me on the car, and at every step in the process made it seem as if I was the only customer he had that day (not the case, they were very busy).  I got a ride home with Maria, who was a recently hired employee.  She had a great attitude, and I enjoyed our conversation immensely.  To my surprise, when Brandon called to tell me later in the day that the car was ready for pickup, he had Maria pick me up and deliver me back to the dealership.  Now THAT'S service."
0,"Not impressed. We came on a recommendation and were not pleased. \n\nThe good: $5 sake bombers\n\nThe miso soup was fine, but pricey. I ordered a regular side salad which was $3.99 and what I got was a small amount of very cheap American blend (iceburg, cabbage, carrot). It shouldn't have been served, it looked old and it tasted like dirt, no flavor of dressing at all.\n\nThe sushi was fine, but small quantity for the price. \n\nI don't think we will return."
0,"Horrible! Food tasteless, watery, just plain awful. Don't go!"
0,The loudest place I've ever tried to relax and sleep in.  Absolutely ridiculous!
1,"One of my friends just moved to San Diego and he knows I'm huge on breakfast so he said he found a new place and told me about it. I later realized that we had one of them in Las Vegas so I decided to go. \n\nOrdered two appetizers, and two dishes for main course and got a few of their specialty drinks.  Wow, the food came out all together and let me tell you the PORTIONS ARE HUGE. Split dishes, don't bother doing it all by yourself or plan on taking home food with you. \n\nYou can feed small countries with the food on these plates. The dishes are unique to themselves, tastes are different. Don't expect the normal eggs Benedict  these are special versions and will be sure to keep you full!\n\nI have been back four times. If your going in a group restaurants website has coupons to save some cash. This is a must go :)"
0,"I don't know where to start, but overall, it was a lousy experience.\n\nI don't frequent any DD very often, but stopped at this one on the way to work for breakfast today.\n\nI got a flatbread breakfast sandwich, hash browns, and a pumpkin latte. The latte tasted like sewer water and I gave up trying to drink it after half the cup. The hash browns were actually pretty good, but the guy who handed me the food (who was the manager) didn't give/ask about ketchup. The sandwich was incredibly dry and the bread was hard/stale.\n\nThe staff were friendly and the entire thing only cost $6, but I guess you get what you pay for.\n\nAs far as food, you're 0 for 3, Dunkin."
1,I am not a fan of family style dining (get your fork off my plate!) so it's not exactly what I would want to do. That being said the food was awesome. Price is on the high side and I didn't like that the young hostess didn't ask us before hand how we felt about eating upstairs or walking up steps when there was an elevator there. That is something that needs to be asked right away before seating anyone. My partner in crime didn't care for that either and service can be slow at times.\nI plan on going back due to the food and for that alone it gets 4 stars.
0,"My husband and I had our vow renweal there in May '09.  Though our ceremony was fun and Elvis did a great job, their customer service leaves much to be desired.\n\nFirst, when we arrived, there was a girl in front of us in line.  She told the person at the desk that she was from rural Alaska and doesn't have a boyfriend but always dreamed of going to a Vegas chapel and having her picture taken in Vegas.  She said she called ahead and it was approved by the manager but the girl at the desk was extremely rude and was practically laughing at her.  I can only imagine how humiliated this poor girl was.  Why do they care if she wants to pay money to have her picture taken with Elvis?  I didn't understand why they were so rude.\n\nWe paid over $200 for our renewal ceremony.  Afterwards, I sent in the form for the four free pictures that were included in our package.  I then get a call from the Chapel that there are only 10 pictures that are in the consideration set for the free pictures and the rest all need to be purchased.  I think this is a rediculous rule and just another attempt to take as much money from each customer as they can.  I called the manager and told her that I do not remember that being explained to us and she was just as rude as the salesperson who humiliated the Alaskian girl.\n\nWho do these people think they are?  It's Vegas.  People are there to have fun.  I think they should consider catering to their clientele and start charging fairly and treating their customers respectfully."
1,"Ambiance - BASIC!  FOOD - Phenomenal!  The amount of Carne Asada in the small and large taco versions was enormous - price was VERY reasonable - the size and quality of the corn quesadillas   (I had the mushroom and added Carne Asada - and tons of the cilantro, onion, lime juice, and some of the red and green salsas all brought to the table in large quantity.  The Horchata was great - light on the sugar - with plenty of taste.  Anna our waitress provided great service and was very patient with a lot of questions - ready to go bk again...."
1,"big lunch buffet  (10.95  $ )  with lots of things to choose from . it's a little bit on the spicy side , but not too much . food was fresh and the seasoning was good . free mango lassie or soda with yelp check in . free choice of regular or garlic naan ."
0,"Not the best Denny's I've been to. It was empty and not busy at all. It seemed as if they had no employees because the manager was the same person taking our order and serving my friend and I. It's super quiet a little to quiet, like a run down saloon in the old west. The service was mediocre and the server didn't ask us what we would like to drink. Overall Denny's is great, just not this location."
1,"New dumpling resturant, not sure if anyone else can recommend other dumpling resturants but this is very delicious. \n\nI brought my friends from LA here and they enjoyed it too!\n\nThe decorations are red and flowers as seen in pictures. They have private rooms: party size and large.\n\nMust order: lamb dumplings!! You can't go wrong with it!\n\nParking is a bit limited but there is some in the back.\n\nLocal mom and pop resturant! I support local restaurants!"
0,It was our first experience at this chain and will be our last.  We only went there in the first place because we were real hungry and had limited choices in this shopping center.  Nothing came close to tasting anything like Chinese food. It's just gross.  We can't figure out why so many of these places exist and why anyone would want to eat at one.
1,"Forget \""Las Islitas\"" that spot is just a hype...Mariscos Playa Escondida has the best seafood/mariscos in the WORLD!  Los aguachiles estaban bien perrones! The tostada mixta was bomb too! Reasonably priced! this is your spot for the cruda! Trust me!! \n\nSincerely,\nA very satisfied customer!"
1,"Deliciously delicious!\n\nI love their spinach and artichoke dip, drive in burger, egg white omelet, spicy calamari  salad, edamame, chicken and waffles, and the bread. \n\nBest place to eat brunch, lunch, dinner, and very late night dinner. Service is awesome! \n\nBUT they close at 3 a.m. The one at the Venetian is 24 hours.\n\nIt's like Cheesecake Factory but I like Grand Lux more."
0,"2.5 stars\n\nApparently this place has some serious Vegas roots.  They used to be over on East Tropicana and have some affiliations with Liberace but there is now a new location on the Westside attached to the bounty hunter in the Albertson's shopping center.\n\nFirst things first, we had really nice service.  Our server was friendly, attentive, and hepful.  \n\nThe atmosphere leaves much to be desired since this place is attached to a bar, the bounty hunter.  There are some random booths and tables thrown in what was clearly an empty space and thats about it.  \n\nThere isn't a wine list or cocktails; just the offerings from the bounty hunter.  Um, no thank you, I don't want a Coors light with my veal.\n\nThey serve piping hot french bread,  It's crusty on the outside and chewy in trhe middle.  It's good.  \n\nWe had mussels to start.  Steamed in white wine with lots of butter, lots of garlic, and lots of chili.  They were spicy! Good flavor and cooked nice but hubs was dissapointed they were previously frozen.  \n\nWe had a cup of minestrone.  It didn't look like any vegetable soup I was used to.  It had ok flavor but was a salty brown sludge.  \n\nDad had the manicotti; the best item we had.  It had yummy creamy ricotta and mozarella and it was good.  \n\nWe shared veal.  I can't remember the name of the dish.  The veal was super tender, topped with copious amounts of a slurried brown sauce and sliced mushrooms.  It had spaghetti with marinara on the side.  It was not veal marsala but the sauce definitely had marsala in it, as did the sauce for the mussels.  I like the flavor of marsala but it seemed strange that it ended up in everything.  \n\nDad licked his spumoni dessert clean.  We shared the tortoni; essentially, vanilla ice cream mixed with frangelico then refrozen.  The presentation is awful but the iuce cream was delicious.  The basically freeze it into a little bowl.  That's it! The don't scoop it out, garnish it or anything! It tastes great though.  The refreezing with the alcohol creates these flaky ice crystals in the ice cream which is a pleasing texture.  Our bill was $50 for 2 sodas, mussels, cup of soup, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts.  Not bad.  \n\nI think I'd be willing to give it another try but have definitely experienced better Italian food at comparable prices in Vegas."
1,"I heart Fresh & Easy.  They have the best sales and really fresh food, hence the name.  This is the first store I have purchased ground beef and could actually touch it without getting grossed out.  Hardly any blood and packaged well enough not to need a seperate wasteful plastic baggy.  80/20 beef under 2 bucks a pound, well under two dollars.  I am impressed.  They don't have checkout lanes, you do it yourself, however I got a friendly greating from the staff.  I would have taken the nice lady up on her offer of free food, but I was allready so full stopping in.  Maybe next time because there will be a next time for sure."
1,"This business is booming and is for good reason.  Great service, great artists, and great experiences.  I wanted to try a new hair style and for us 40 somethings change can be a little scary out of the comfort zone.  Well I asked Rick to give me a cut similar to a model in a magazines cut.  Well he did and let's say that it looked better on the model.  Since it didn't work, I contacted Rick to have it switched back to before and he made time for me in his busy schedule to put my hair back on track.  He did not charge me and was more than gracious.  I also love that they carry my favorite hair paste which is hard to find in Phoenix aquage.  Its great for fine hair.  They also have tasty beverages ready when I walk in which is appreciated in the morning if I have not had my coffee.  Love, Love, Love R Salon."
0,"Long wait, food was weak. Even Ray Charles could see this meal was a fail."
1,"Lunch here?  Very typical, spotty service (waiter seemed spacey), and my pasta was a bit too bland (orchette).\n\nDinner?  Completely different story.\n\nI came here for a private dinner and the service, the wine and the tasting menu put together for us was absolutely divine.\n\nI had couscous that made me want to cry, lobster canneloni that made me want to...cry,  chilean sea bass that made me want to...you get the picture.  If I hadn't been surrounded by collegues I would have been one gigantic mess, a puddle on the floor.\n\nI love food and I love it when it is spot on and when it's interesting without being flat out weird.\n\nI don't know why lunch was so off?\n\nEdit:  I think I figured it out.  I had no idea there were 2 sections of the restaurant.  For lunch, we sat in the bar-like area where the service was \""eh\"" and the food was \""eh\"".\n\nI imagine they have 2 seperate kitchens for the private dining and the bar area."
1,"I was visiting Phoenix and my cousin lives in Florence, so I took a drive over to see him and his wife who actually live in Anthem.  They were telling me about this new restaurant that opened on Thursday, and although I was hesitant to go, because I own an Italian Restaurant on Winter Springs Florida, I said let's give it a try, as I love to critique the competitors.  \n\nI must say that they are doing everything right.  The food is fresh, tasty and hot when it came to the table, and the Tomato Oil is \""spot on\""!  Such a nice little restaurant in the Community, I'm sure this will be a welcome establishment to all the surrounding neighbors.  Good luck to the Barker and Valentino's!!!"
0,"I didn't really enjoy it, actually. It was my first time and they were basically giving me that look like why did I even show up if I didn't know what I was doing. Um, isn't that why you go to new restaurants? He did explain to me what they had and things of that nature but it just was very uncomfortable. The sandwich wasn't as I expected."
1,"I don't know why but i keep forgetting about the Sainte Elisabeth. Be this because it's tucked away on an adorable sidestreet or because each of my visits have been so relaxing and hassle-free, i do not know. However, i have been both in summer and in winter and enjoyed myself immensely every time.\n\nAs with most of my Montreal favourites, what i like about this venue is its multiculturality. Located right next to UQAM but still just a hop-skip-and-jump from the Plateau and swarms of McGill students, the crowd is thoroughly bilingual and tables frequently switch between languages. What could be more typically Montreal than this?\n\nThe inner-courtyard is just fabulous. At least fifteen feet high, the walls are covered in ivy and at night the lights create a homey glow - i half expect little fairies to pop up at any moment. Even on windy days (like yesterday), one can enjoy the terrasse protected from the cool breezes but in the shade. Although yesterday i was cursing this (i am trying to stop smoking), as the courtyard is unroofed you can smoke freely - but the air still circulates.\n\nOf course, we only have about three months of the year when outdoor drinking is feasible, but an excellent selection of beers with daily specials, friendly wait staff, clean washrooms and comfy benches make the indoor experience equally pleasurable.\n\nA word to the wise, however - some online reviewers mention great food. There is no kitchen at the Sainte Elisabeth - they order in the food from the outside. Hence, i have never ordered the food myself. Too close to other great venues (like Frite Alors) to be worth chancing it!"
0,"Ok, let us sum up what you get from the 11\u00a3 you pay for this tour:\na tedious short walk in boring roads of the old town with loads of stops in which you have to listen to tacky stories with the guide shouting every now and then trying to scare you (if I lived in the old town I'd report this to the police), then you enter in the so called vaults, and what you get to see are:\n\n1) A narrow and rotting staircase\n2) Two cellar rooms with a bumpy floor\n2) a corridor\n3) a narrow cellar room in which you are told about a lady on a tour who heard whispers coming from the backwall.\n\nNot much indeed. The time is filled up by the awkwardly tacky story-telling\n\nThe underground rooms are but a cellar. I am from Italy and most italian buildings have cellars which look complitely identical, with the sole exception of salami and wine which here were absent.\nThey spend some time telling you that people used to spend time there and that they found oyster shells which might indicate that the room was a tavern of some sort, but the whole thing is rather pathetic. 3 minutes would be too much to take a look at what is there to see. \nThey show many stories underground in boards and posters giving the impression that you actually get to explore a complex system of underground tunnels and rooms, but then you only get to see three rooms and a corridor.\nObviously we complained and the manager was hiding behind the good reviews. Oh dear, a bunch of hyped-up tourists giving 5 stars to everything they've done is hardly an excuse to rip people off in this way.\n\u00a32.50 would be an adequate price, and without the time-filler, I mean the tacky storytelling.\nStrongly advise you not to go on ANY tour of this kind."
0,"I've been waiting a few weeks before posting a review because I wanted to be as fair as possible. On the good side, this company was prompt to return my calls & were sort of on time to appear (they came at the very tail end of their time window.)\n\nOn the bad side, they sent someone who didn't speak very much English & he couldn't understand what I wanted to have done on the trees. I was really hoping for a real arborist who could help me understand the different options, but I ended up just pointing and hoping for the best. When I came back after running some quick errands, I found most of my tree on the ground & somehow it still looked as scraggly as it started! I called the owner to complain and he said a) that I didn't know what I was talking about, b) that I was looking for a free trim job, and c) that he could come by to look at it and to tell me that he thought it looked good (his opinion from the few cell phone photos that the trimming guy sent to him.)\n\nThey've been calling every few days to see when they could come and tell me that the tree looks fine, but honestly, I don't think that will help me feel better at all. I don't really want to talk to them again after being so insulted when I was really upset over the bad trim my tree had gotten from them...\n\nMaybe if you speak Spanish and already know everything you need to know about trees, this would be an okay company to try, but I think that the owner should really consider whether or not he should personally meet new clients to better understand their needs and also really, really consider what he says to them."
0,Service has become slow and poor. Food still ok. We had to ask for water 5 times by walking up to waitress. Took a long time for bill. They need more service help now.
1,"So my buddy and I walked into Upper Crust Pizza and sat at the sports bar side which had TVs on the wall with all the games on- sweet! The area has a classy yet relaxed and fun atmosphere. Right when we sat down our waitress, Aliyah, came to take our order. Aliyah was very friendly, social, and just had a great attitude. The best part of Aliyah was her pulchritudinous and mesmerizing looks- almost as she was radioactive with \""bueatiful-ness-energy\"" radiating from her.  Aliyah, with her ridiculously piercing good looks, recommended the Fried Mozzarella and they were delicious- something new that I've never tried. On to the main dish where we had half mushrooms and half pepperoni on our pizza. The pizza came out in about 15-20 minutes. The crust I'd rate a 4/5, the sauce 4/5, could use  a little more topping to really taste them 3.5/5, but the cheese was a 5/5 since you could definitely tell that the cheese was high quality- something most pizza places skimp out on. Overall the pizza was great! However not as great as Aliyah's supermodel good looks!"
0,"Spirit Airlines..... where to begin? \n\nI flew you once back in May and swore to myself that I would never fly with you guys again. Sure, you make it known: \""You get a seat-- That's it. --You hungry? Thirsty? Then you betta pay up mothaf*ka\"" \n\nSo you have this cool little gimmick about how your rates are SOOO low, but you stress the tight seating and additional fees.  \nTight seating? ==Not a problem. \nI'm no princess or 'leg room nazi'.  It's the fact that every time I fly you guys something goes wrong.  First flight I had with you guys, we ended up in Pennsylvania. I was supposed to land in Baltimore.  One of the bathrooms was broken and it ended up being a full plane ride bathroom break for the ONE working bathroom.  Then we landed and I proceeded to baggage claim where I waited for my luggage for nearly an hour.  \n\nThis recent flight, I got slapped with an additional 50 bucks for my bag being too \""heavy\"".  I already paid 40 bucks to check it and even looked for something to indicate that it was going to be a little bit more weight.  I guess theres \""fine print\"" that explains it.  There always is, isn't there? \n\nWell. To conclude this review: Pay the extra 100 or so bucks for an ACTUAL airline because you end up paying what you \""save\"" with Spirit anyways.  \n\nGet yourself some leg room and that bag of complimentary peanuts.  It may not be a meal, but shit, it's better than nothing."
0,"What the heck happened to this event? Dos Gringos??? Chipotle? The first time I came was 9 years ago and it's completely changed. This place was packed. You had to wait in line for everything. And I don't get paying admission to get in and then paying admission to get into one of the drink special areas like the beer garden and then paying again to get drinks in those areas. And many places ran out of food before the sun went down and this was suppose to go on until 10pm. \n\nSome of the best stuff was free. A free sample of pork and a free sample of cheese. The free cheese tent should have been placed next to the Robert Mondavi wine area.  That would have been much more convenient for me. I did enjoy the chocolate fondue from the Melting Pot because well, it's chocolate. I guess I'm lucky that I'll eat just about anything and came hungry. The people watching was the best part."
1,"Enjoyed the OMG Burger.  Significant size, topped with bacon, aioli, house made pickles, cheese.  Served with what seemed like a boat load of steak fries.  Good burger. \n\nThe outside area is nice, fun, vintage picnic classic in a way.  The temperature outside was warm.  It is outside, so be warned if it was noon and 115 outside."
1,"We have dined here twice and been pleased both times. The homemade gnocch is delicious as were the ravioli. I can't recommend the escargot, however, they were't great. The waitstaff is friendly and efficient. You are able to dine inside or outdoors."
0,"In my experience I found her not to have the level of knowledge and expertise expected.  Suspect either poor listening or poor comprehension skills as she researches and answers questions not asked, while failing to respond to those actually asked then charges both meeting time and research time.\n\nInitially found her to be basically competent in elementary tax matters (ie turbo tax or other software might do just as well) but would suggest seeking expertise elsewhere if your situation has any degree of complexity or variance to vanilla 1040."
1,"Reserved a room at the HardRock for my roommate's birthday and stayed there for 3 days, 2 nights at the Paradise Tower. Our room was very spacious with a lot of closet and drawer space (for 4 girls...!). Shoes, shoes, shoes. Lots of mirrors too! Another plus for a room full of 4 girls.\n\nThe bathroom had a beautiful dark red rock-damask design (weird combination right? but it works!) My only complaint about the bathroom was that the modern design of the showerhead made it have a lot less pressure than one would want -- it barely took the shampoo out! Looks nice, doesn't function as it should.\n\n+1 for room service & the cleanliness of the overall hotel\n\n+1 for the sun-blocking curtains that let us sleep well into the day!\n\n+1 for carrying out the Hard Rock concept so well \n\n+1 for the two really good clubs in the lobby. Packed & poppin. Strong drinks. Best DJ I've ever heard - played a whole chain of the best West Coast songs! Find a recruiter walking around though that will hook you (girls) up with free entrance as opposed to $20.\n \n-1 for charging us $45 for moving the mini-bar dollar shots. If you trigger the sliding sensor for more than 45 seconds, it does an auto-charge to your room bill! We contested this with the concierge and even told them to go back up to our room to confirm the dollar shots were still in place because there was NO WAY in hell we were going to pay $45 for 3 bottles of DOLLAR SHOTS."
1,"here's a tip for you guys...they DO take reservations!!!  i don't know why a lot of people don't call ahead of time, specially on weekends when the wait can go as long as 2 hours.  \n\nfor a little over $13 for dinner (does not include drinks) it's all you can eat chinese & japanese cuisine.  they have a wide variety of sushi/sashimi to choose from. they have a good selection of bbq'd/grilled meats and seafood.  they even have a stir fry section where you get to choose the ingredients (vegies, shrimp, chicken, beef, noodles) and they cook it for you.  they also have crab legs, prime rib, crawfish, frog legs, dim sum, etc. they also have a very good dessert selection which includes an ice cream bar and a fruit bar.  for kids they have chicken wings, fried shrimp and french fries just to name a few.\n\ni've been there quiet a few times since they opened last October and never had any problems with service and the place is clean.  for the price, you really can't beat it!"
0,"This place was a huge letdown in addition to being overpriced.  \n\nWe went here while starving for lunch and read the menu outside the restaurant which sounded great- nothing uniquely special, typical thai-japanese dishes but we looked forward to ordering dishes that we were already familiar with.\n\nPut in our names, hostess said it wouldn't take more than 15-25minutes max.  She took our cell phone number and said they would call when it was ready.  We checked back 30 minutes later after no call, still no table.  Another 20 minutes later and now even more starving, they finally seated us- they had never even called us to tell us our table was ready.  Not sure if they may have written the number down wrong.\n\nSo after the 50 minute wait to be seated we already knew what we wanted.\nSalmon skin rolls, pad thai, mongolian beef, bok choy, miso soup, and a thai crepe dessert.\n\nThe salmon skin rolls were fishy and not up to par of what my friends were used to at other japanese restaurants.  Even though they were starving they didn't even want to finish the rolls.\n\nThe pad thai was AWFUL! The only good thing about it was the giant shrimp that came with it.  Couldn't pinpoint what exactly made it so bad but that was another dish that went unfinished.\n\nBok choy was good but how badly could a nice restaurant like this one mess up a stir fry vegetable dish?\n\nMongolian beef was the only main dish that was good.  \n\nAfter trying all the main dishes we cancelled the crepe dessert in fear of getting served another plate that was another disaster version of a favorite dish!\n\nThe only upside was the service and the thai iced tea.\n\nSuch a disappointment for a restaurant that should have been a high quality meal in one of vegas's nicest new casino additions.\nHoping we came on an off day, the server said that sometimes the dishes vary depending on the chef.  Unfortunately I don't intend on going back to find out if that's true."
1,"Modern, spacious, clean.  Very well-equipped.  Hubby and I checked out several other gyms in Pittsburgh before joining UA and we really like it there.  \n\nAll of the group classes and spinning are included with the membership, and you can pay a little extra to add unlimited tanning to your membership if that is your thing.  (It's not really mine, so I can't comment on the quality of the tanning beds or anything.)\n\nOne of my favorite features is the \""cardio cinema,\"" a room full of treadmills, elliptical trainers etc. where they project movies onto a big screen with surround sound.  It is really easy to lose track of time when you're in there -- in the best of ways!  Sometimes the movie of the day is a bit of a stinker (could they PLEASE stop playing All About Steve?) but for the most part, it is a neat addition to the gym.\n\nThe pool is warm and generally isn't very crowded, for those of you who might be interested in swimming laps.  \n\nThere are tons of trainers and they often offer special pricing on training packages...\n\nGenerally friendly staff and the pricing is reasonable.  And the post-workout shakes, while not cheap, are DELICIOUS and a great, healthful source of nutrition after a long workout.\n\nThe only cons I can think of are a) It would be really nice if there were a couple more showers in the ladies locker room, it can get a bit crowded during busy times of the day.  b) I find it annoying to pay for a gym membership and then see employees standing around when there are free weights and stuff lying around where they shouldn't be.  I realize that they can't control the behavior/habits of gym members, but they could take a few minutes and clean things up if they're between appointments, etc.  \n\nI would really recommend looking into this gym if you're on the market!"
1,"Ice House Tavern is a dive bar with character.\n\nBehind the bar is a large plexiglass wall with the Arcadia ice rink on the other side. The coolness of this is that you can sit at the bar and watch hockey or ice-skating while you drink. When we first arrived, there was a hockey game in mid-swing. There were multiple occurrences of goal shots gone wide, with a final destination of smacking against the back of the plexiglass bar wall near us. I found this to be highly entertaining, but it could definitely cause some people to get startled, so you might not want to sit directly at the bar if there is a hockey game on-going and you are easily spooked.\n\nThey've got darts, video games, plenty of seating and a good bottled beer selection. I wish they had a good micro-brew on tap, but alas, I settled for the bottle route. Thankfully, they've got some awesome bottled beers, like the 22 oz Arrogant Bastard Ale from Stone Brewery and Kiltlifter from Four Peaks.\n\nCool (literally) & unique dive bar. Check it out and then test your luck out on the ice.\n\nP.S. The place can be a bit difficult to find if you don't know where it is. Drive to the left of Wal-mart and into the back alley area, passing Arcadia Ice Rink & then make a left. You'll see banners at the top of the end of the first building. That's the spot. Enter on the side."
0,"They have removed all the pastries cookies sweets and treats, very limited on some pastries maybe a cookie or two but no more raspberry cheesecake any of the fancy stuff that is all gone fancy drinks are gone it used to be a really fun place to come to an evening or anytime it has gone downhill seriously, we would never return to this place, I had ham and cheese croissant,It was bad, I get a better and cheese croissant at McDonald's, The restaurant still looks the same but it's it's very depressing the main bar on the floor facing Paris is no longer  open anymore, They only had 2 Waiters on the floor really slow service so sad."

0,"For the price, this was not a great dining experience. The wait staff was not particularly friendly, helpful, attentive, or memorable. I was very disappointed. I expected much more of a family type atmosphere, and I've felt more valued and welcome at Olive Garden. Recommendations were brief, with no explanation or passion into the suggestions. The waiter took the orders in a clockwise manner around the table, and did not take the ladies first, which I find inappropriate for a nice meal. \n\nFor as in a hurry as he was to take the orders, there was a lot of snappiness in the service. I have no problem with a nice slow paced meal, but this was not that. We waited an extraordinary amount of time to receive our check, too. If I remember correctly, we got stuck with a 20% auto-tip too. I don't mind auto-tip for parties over 6, but let's not assume 20%, okay?\n\nThe food was good, but not great. My veal was not particularly tender, which seems like would be the signature of veal. I paid the same amount for a lamb dish at Circo days later and they weren't even in the same league.\n\nI had high hopes after seeing and hearing so much about Rao's, but I left very disappointed and I wouldn't recommend Rao's to you. I didn't expect it to be as good as the famous New York original (I've never been there), but a reasonable facsimile would have been nice."
0,"This place sucks, the service is horrible. We ordered our pizzas and only got one, when the \""waitress\"" finally realized that she messed up she wanted us to wait for 45 minutes extra. Never come back, all the \""servers\"" suck! The pizza is so greasy. Terrible food, terrible service. That's why they have drink specials, so you get drunk enough to think their food is good."
1,"Two words: \""Potpourri heaven\"" \n\nI love stopping in to this business every time I find myself in the Strip District. The front entrance, interior and back patio look like something out of a whimsical dried flower wonderland. You'll find everything from single stem flowers to create your own arrangements to paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 dog heads for decoration. The back patio filled with plants and water features is definitely one of the highlights during the warmer months. \n\nPrices can be on the higher side so if you don't find yourself making a grand purchase, inspiration is certainly guaranteed upon exiting the business. \n\nA few other items you'll find at this business: wreaths, terrariums, crafting books, beautiful stationery, and fun garland."
1,"All I can say is WOW!\n\nI have been bringing in my repair work for about 10 years now.  My Tag Heuer watch band broke in a spot that was not repairable.  The band is over $1000.00 new to replace.\n\nLenny (the senior Rakhman) spent 3 days soaking and cleaning a decade worth of grime off the band, found a way to laser-weld the link, and made the entire watch look and feel like new!  When he gave me the price, $40.00, I almost fell over.\n\nWhat an absolutely wonderful place to do business.  Local, family owned and operated, and very much aware that their name is everything!\n\nThank You Guys!"
1,Best tacos for your buck hands down but be aggressive  seating is limited due to how many people are there.
1,"Sassi's is a fantastic place for a special occasions.  Of course, if you have a big enough food budget you could go for fun all the time!  The ambiance is top-notch, and the building itself is beautiful.  I would sit outside near sunset in nice weather if possible.  Gorgeous views.\n\nThe food, wine, and service is also top-notch.  I've eaten here several times and each time the food blew us away, and the waitstaff is very knowledgable and enjoyable to talk to.  All the plates just seem to be perfect.  Whether we had the small plate of nuts for an appetizer, or a beef or fish main course, or the desert, it all was presented beautifully and was delicious.  This is probably the best restaurant overall that I've been to, and I've been to a lot!"
0,"Hmm I was disappointed. It smelt of feet and the music wasn't great at all but maybe I went on a bad night. Blonde barmaid is super quick and efficient though, never waited more than a minute for a drink!"

0,"My children have been patients at Scottsdale Children's Group since my first son was born in April 2005. I absolutely LOVED this place and could not have imagined better care for my precious bundle. As the stork dropped off two more babies over the years, I continued to choose for them to be cared for at the Shea location of Scottsdale Children's Group. I constantly referred new moms to SCG. In 2010 (after being a 5 year veteran), I noticed a change. There was a lot of new front-office staff and the overall \""vibe\"" of the entire practice seemed unhappy. I brushed it off thinking that we are in a recession and things must be difficult for ALL businesses right now. I hung in there for another 3 years through times of NO available (same day sick) appts. and grumpy comments from staff (including doctors) during well-check appts.. Until today. I have TWO sick children home from school. I called at 8am to make an appt. for both children. 10:15am (thank goodness it was available)! I get them fed, dressed & out the door with time to spare. We arrived promptly at 10:15am through the sick-child entrance. They took my $25 per child co-pay and asked me to have a seat. ONE HOUR LATER, we are still sitting in the front waiting room. My daughter is lethargic with her head on my lap and my son is crying, \""Can we please just go home\""?! We were there for help that never seemed to be coming. I asked for my co-pay back at the front desk and drove my children home. My daughter threw up on the car ride home, but I felt as though I only had myself to blame. I should have left Scottsdale Children's Group years ago when I only had good memories of baby days in my rear-view mirror. I will NEVER go back. My children deserve better...... and so do yours. If you are reading this in search of a pediatrician. Keep looking. While the doctors are very skilled, the \""customer service\"" is severely lacking. Ask friends for referrals, but don't decide on SCG if your children, your time and your money are hot ticket items for you. You can find good doctors elsewhere."
0,Was not thrilled by the massage or the way that they try to railroad you into a contract. I did not like either one ... They pretend to be the premier place to go but truthfully they are subpar.....   I viewed them as used car salesmen....
1,"GR8 GR8 GR8.....Healthy, Tastey food,  Large Portions, Priced Well.  what more can you ask for? \n\nI had a Chicken Shwarma wrap. They used 1 whole cup of shredded chicken. \n\nI was given a choice of white or whole wheat, HOME+MADE  pita bread that was rolled out like a giant tortilla.\n\nThey have a to go menu printed on glossy paper that features photos of their food.  As do many other establishments, the difference being at PMG the pictures actually look like their food. That's as good as it gets."
0,"We arrived and they told our party of 8 that it's going to be an hour wait. Of course. It's Friday night. What's really cool is that the hostess ask for one of our cell phone number and she texted us a msg to tell us to keep an eye out when she text us to tell us the seats are ready. More places need to implement this function! Instead of waiting an hour in front of the restaurants like dummies, we were able to walk around and sit down comfortably to chat in another area. \n\nI got the Frrrozen Hot Choco. Why is it over $10? It's not really that different than any other blended mocha that I had... in fact, I think Coffee Bean's is actually richer... The only thing that got the Frrozen Hot Choco going was the delicious whipped cream... that I told myself I would not finish... but ended up finishing anyways.\n\nIt makes a lot more sense to just go to the to-go window and grab it to go. But honestly, why even bother? It's just a really fancy place for a date with overpriced food that is not justifiable."
1,"Tonight has got to be one of the best flights I have ever been on. The flight departed on time AND landed waaay before the scheduled arrival time. There were some empty seats on the newer aircraft so there was plenty of room. The highlight of the trip: Dan, the flight attendant. He is incredibly funny and had a way with his intercom announcements that EVERYONE was listening to the airbag and seat belt safety instructions. We even got a lovely song from him upon landing! Thank you Southwest for reaffirming that you are one of the best airlines to fly with!"
0,"Supposedly the oldest Mexican restaurant in the area, we were directed here by our concierge.  The place has a kitchy, almost 80's feel, but it needs some updating.   The menu is a bit too \""American\"" for me; if you expect a truly authentic experience, this is not the place.  I think they get a lot of tourists here, who are used to the more Americanized dishes.  \n\nTo start, the salsa is extremely tasty - very fresh - although the chips seemed \""bag\"" quality.  After that, it was all downhill.  Two stars is a gift - it's closer to 1 star.  For lunch, we had the machaca - dry, shredded beef with peppers and tomatoes, and a combo plate of chile relleno and a corn tamale.  The plates look like a disaster when served; sauce everywhere, very disorganized.  The plates came out so hot they must have been microwaved - not a good sign at a respectable restaurant.  Too much sauce, also a sign of laziness and lack of attention to detail.  The rice was not great - not made fresh, and also crisp on top from the microwave (or taken from yesterday's rice pot).  The refried beans were a flavorless mash of canned beans; avoid.  The machaca shredded meat itself was somewhat flavorful, but again it appeared that they make it day(s) earlier and then re-heat it after slapping it on a plate.  Not authentic. The flour tortilla was huge and actually the best thing I tasted, other than the salsa.  Americanized, large plates of re-heated slop.  My advice - find a REAL Mexican restaurant, and stay away from this joint."
1,"I LOVE MARIO'S! I visit Pittsburgh at least once a year and I make sure to visit this spot every time! \n\nThe staff are awesome and personable! Even when it's super busy, you can still get a drink in reasonable time! \n\nI like how there are levels that welcome smoking and other ones that do not. (I'm a non-smoker and appreciate this quality!) \n\nIt gets rowdy there, but that's part of the South Side fun!"
0,"called them for wind shield replacement. Had my wind shield replaced and it leaked water through the seal and shorted out electronics in dash. They replaced the seal the next day at there north vegas location, they damaged molding on drivers side of car.

He talked to the manager, but I was so disinterested at this point."

Food was ok and moderately priced for a restaurant at The Wynn, but I probably wouldn't return.  \n\nCantonese Potstickers- lots of meaty filling, but the skin wrapper wasn't the best.\n\nMongolian Beef-extremely tender cuts of beef, but the sauce wasn't sweet enough (I hate to say it, but PF Changs is better!)\n\nGreen vegetables garlic stir fry-probably the best dish as the veggies were fresh and crisp and it included a nice variety of Chinese broccoli, asparagus, baby bok choy, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, and plenty of chopped garlic!\n\nWoo at The Palazzo would probably have been more authentic..."
1,"AMAZING SANDWICHES !!  Earl's lived up to it's reputation.  I love their hot sandwiches and how cheap they are ($6.99) especially since it's on the strip (in Planet Hollywood).  Earl's is also 24/7 now, and be sure to try their brownie sandwiches if you've got a sweet tooth; my boyfriend made us walk to Earl's THREE TIMES for these brownie sandwiches.  All in all, a must try when you're in Vegas."
0,"Just back from the worst lunch experience I have ever had.  My husband has a \""NO CHILIS\"" policy and I need to follow that.  \n\nArrived and were seated immediately by being asked to take a booth in the bar area. Plenty of available tables but none the less, was asked to sit there.  We were greeted by a nice enough server and she explained the new MiniPad system.  We immediately ordered strawberry lemonade and iced tea.  (2 of us)\n\nWhen the drinks arrived, we ordered from the menu.  My lunch partner had the steak fajitas and I thought to try something new on the menu, Chipotle Shrimp Bowl  The photo looked wonderful.\n\n40 minutes later... yes, FORTY MINUTES LATER...and after seven other tables seated AFTER US by at least 10 minutes were served, our food arrived.  I was famished.  \n\nFirst bite of my bowl was a piece of chipotle shrimp and lettuce and the food was COLD.  Odd, I thought this was grilled shrimp.  So, I bit into another one and yep, cold.  So I broke open one and it was raw.  Yep.  Raw shrimp.\n\nI called the manager over who seemed amazed the food was cold and didn't really respond that it took 40 minutes to arrive and offered me a bowl of soup.  (its 110 degrees outside today.)\n\nNo thank you.  Just the check please.  After 10 minutes, we received a to go order we placed 30 minutes prior and now the server had a huge attitude with us.  I guess being angry at waiting so long and getting raw shrimp served to us is no reason to be upset in her world.\n\nI left a 1.00 tip and we left.  \n\nI will not go back here and I urge anybody reading this... find someplace else to go."
0,"Too many waiters.  All asking the same question one after the other.  The attempt to have great customer care became a real annoyance.\n\nAt the end of the meal when asked if we wanted coffee by waiter #2 and we had already order coffee from waiter #1 I barked back and stated we just ordered it 30 seconds early.  Seems like a small deal but when asked \""do you want more bread\"" and then \""do you want more bread,\"" followed by \""do you want more water,\"" then \""do you want more water\"" and so on...it made the meal rushed and choppy. \n\nWe have not been to SW in years.  It was  always a great experience.  I am not sure what we were expecting but after the endless video loops playing everywhere at the Wynn about the restaurants, including SW, we expected the same great experience as we had enjoyed historically.  \nThe food was no different than any other high end steak house.  Much of the decor appeared dated.  The waterfall show was unchanged, tired and dingy.  \n\nWe will not go back."
0,Don't come here!!!! WORST customer service ever! Bar tender is the manager and is pathetic. Refused to open a bottle of Grey Goose that was clearly on the shelf. They only care about making money and spanking people who don't finish their burgers! What a waste of my time!
0,"Cindy 's review is spot on. They just lack class at this establishment. Our server told us they were closed and the bar tender had to remind him what time they served food until. So the two stars are for the bartender. \n\nThere are just too many sushi places in the area to be treated poorly. \n\nThe food was decent, the price was fine, I am just too old for bad service by a waiter who sniffles and talks rapidly without ever making eye contact. Grow up, clearly you still want to be in college, but you're not."
0,"I used to go to this deli all the time when I lived in copper basin, It was the best place around as a matter of fact after we moved to apache junction we still made it a point to make the 20 mile drive at least once a month, well they must have gotten greedy because the prices stayed the same but the food got worse, first mistake was switching to thrifty ice cream, second was switching to garbage meat while still advertising the boars head name, third mistake was the cookies went from reasonably sized to so small a child would be unhappy with the size. If everything stayed the same I would be still going there, the day all three of those factors came into play, my wife and I both agreed that it tasted disgusting and they must have tried to cut costs. sad that they closed because of it. lesson learned."
1,"Ra is very easy sushi for the uninitiated. It's fairly reliable and tasty. It's not the best sushi in the world, but c'mon - this is Arizona. Sushi snobs/connoisseurs won't think much of this place. \n\nThe place is nice inside and the waitstaff is comprised of young and beautiful girls. The bar is a bit of a hot spot and the restaurant in general manages to stay busy most of the time. It seems to have a lot of 20-30somethings at the bar and high school girls in the main room. The older guys in the bar area look like they just got off work with the top buttons of their collared shirts undone, but their tans and physique suggest they put that look together. \n\nThe high school girls look like they took fashion and makeup tips from Paris Hilton and then doubled it... overdone and looking like they belong on some Mtv reality show. Think: modernized 80s Madonna. I imagine them going back to school the next day and bragging to their classmates how they went and had sushi at Ra thinking they are so adult. I wanted to choke those bitches out when I was in High School - nice to see nothing ever changes.\n\nIt's a good place to take someone who hasn't ever really tried sushi before or people who are scared of sushi. I like to eat here because it's close and simple. I haven't really had a bad experience yet. Sushi lovers/experts might want to steer clear."
1,"My first time at The Roosevelt over last week's First Friday shenanigans, and even though it was pretty crowded, I loved it. Friendly folks, great beer, cool vibes, and lots of opportunities to strike up conversations. A patron there even offered me the house pretzel for a few bites (it was excellent). I'd love to go back on a less crowded night to hang out. Cool place."
1,"Definitely call ahead for a reservation.  We were out and decided to eat her since it was near by.  The wait was long for a table but everywhere would have had a wait on a Saturday night.  the food was really good as expected for a steak house of this caliber.  Would I wait again,  probably not. . Would I eat here again,  definitely buy only with a reservation."
0,"Didn't know about the Mystere package, so we sort of just ended up here for dinner before the show. The decor is your normal dimly-lit, slightly stuffy steakhouse. The decor is not a hip, trendy place. We were able to get a table without a reservation around 7pm.\n\nTheir corn chowder with lobster soup is excellent! There is alot of lobster in the soup. They are definitely generous. The bread they serve is a warm white bread with bits of bacon and potatoes in it.\n\nI got the short ribs, which actually comes with two sides - grilled asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes. I was disappointed in the short ribs - the sauce for it was just tooooo sweet. Pair that with the sweet mashed potatoes and you're talking a very sugary entree. I also tried the filet mignion and thought it was average. The broccolini side was delicious and garlicky - I would recommend that for the veggie side. \n\nTheir desserts are all mini-sized and perfert portion to top off a big meal. The creme brulee was excellent! There were little vanilla bean specks on the bottom. I scraped that thing clean!\n\nI would give this place a 3 for the meats and a 5 for the appetizer/sides/dessert."
0,"I was really unimpressed. My boyfriend and I went in wanting pad thai like we are used to finding at other restaurants. What we got was expensive, not anything special, and a small portion size."
0,"Went on a date here with my boyfriend after finding a Groupon for this restaurant. We ordered Chicken Pad Thai and roast duck with vegetables. The pad thai was not very good. The roast duck was decent, but when I ordered a side of rice it was over priced and the portion was very small. In fact, all of the portions were small and overpriced, including the VERY SMALL and expensive spring rolls. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a coke and it was very expensive and did not get free refills. Would NOT return to this place again. Especially if i had to pay full price for it."
1,"Five stars for the OMG AMAZING superfood salad (super is right)!!!  I hope they never, ever take this off the menu...not even in a zillion years.  It's just so lovely and exactly what I have been missing at nearly every other restaurant in the UK.  People often ask me what I miss about home (US) and the only thing I say without hesitation is, \""the entree salad.\""  Why is it so rare here to find a salad that is not only big enough to constitute an entire meal, but is also GOOD?  Well here at Pizza Express, of all places, I have finally found it.  This was my first time ever in a Pizza Express.  There's apparently one in George Square, but I've been spending all my culinary energy in that part of town at Pintos...not any more I won't!\n\nThree stars for the ho-hum service.  Nothing remarkably bad about the service, but certainly nothing stand-out amazing.  So four stars it is for Pizza Express - imagine my surprise!"
1,"I went to the Tryst for the Halloween costume party and I would say the party was awesome, and the costumes were simply amazing. Unfortunately that was the only time I went to the Tryst, so I am a little bias on judging the crowd to be super hot when everyone is wearing lingeries. This unfortunately includes a few guys going in the Borat one piece thong bikini (totally overplayed, and not funny anymore).\n\nI was actually on the guestlist for this club, but for some odd reason took too long to get to the club. At 12am, they close the guestlist or any type of promotion offers for out of state visitors. You will have to fork out the $30 cover. Since it was Halloween, I had no option but to do it.  As far as drink prices goes, it is $24 for two mixed drinks and not including tips. When drinks are that expensive, you are probably going to get the stink eye if you only tip a dollar. I suggest going a little higher if you want better service. \n\nThe highlight of the club has to be the huge man made water fall infront of the dance floor. I didnt see any professional go-go dancers that night, but random girls in the club were getting up on the podiums to dance looked great. Surprisingly enough they actually knew how to dance besides just 'jiggling dat jelly'.  The VIP table areas were very spacious. You pretty much get an entire end couch per table. I am not sure if the exotic ladies were included with the table, or came with the guests..but each table had its own hostess that would prepare drinks for the VIPs. \n\nThe party here does not end until well past 6am from what I heard. I had too much fun for the 4 hours I was there, but next time I will try to make it till the end.  That or max out my credit card. One or the other is worth it for this fine establishment at the Wynn."
0,"Arrived at 1 on a Friday to avoid the lunch rush. Food was placed in front of me :50 minutes later :( \""Sorry about the wait, all these people (13) had to eat before you.\""\n\nNot true: I was seated before 11 of them.\n\nOrdered the crunchy shrimp wrap (spinach tortilla). Not bad tasting, but the cream cheese (yep) does NOT work. The fat in the cream cheese coats the tongue and blocks the subtle flavors of the shrimp and veggies from coming through. I tasted cream cheese and the green onions. Great mouth feel with the shrimp coating and crispy cuke pieces.\n\nI will go back and try something else.\n\nLow marks for long wait, surliness, and poor recipe development."
0,"I really used to be a big fan of the Sahara.  In fact, up until today it was pretty much the place I always stayed in Vegas, but now the love affair has died.\n\nTo be fair, I really should write separate reviews for the hotel and the casino.  I'll start with the hotel.  The Sahara is pretty much the cheapest hotel in Vegas that won't give you something potentially fatal or disfiguring by coming into contact with the sheets.  If you stay here I reccomend you splurge for one of the premium room.  The standard rooms are just a little TOO beat up.  I mean hey, old school is cool and all, and I figure at least one of the cigarrette burns in the table was probably done by Elvis or something, but man I need internet and other amenities or I'm staying someplace else.  I would give the hotel as a stand alone two stars.\n\nNow for the casino.  The Sahara casino has all the charisma and charm of a 67 year old hooker with missing teeth.  It used to be different there.  They used to have $1.00 blackjack tables.  Those tables rocked.  You've never met so many happy people sitting gambling.  There was usually a twenty plus minute wait for those tables.  Anyone with half a brain would have designated MORE tables as $1.00 blackjack tables, right?  You do know what's coming next... they raised the table minimums to $5.  Idiots.  During the week I can gamble on five dollar tables in MUCH NICER casinos.  Why the hell would I go to the Sahara if you're not going to offer me something better or cheaper?\n\nOK, so then, and this is the final straw for me, they had this one game of blackjack where you could put another dollar down and if you got  natural blackjack you could push a button and win up to a grand (but you normally only won like five or ten bucks).  It was fun, and once again it filled tables.  So, what do you think they did with it?  Yep, they did away with it.\n\nFriggin' IDIOTS.  So now the Sahara is mostly emplty and the people that are there are the 80 year old smoking while carrying their oxygen tank around crowd and people from the 909.  This is why I give the Casino one star.  You average my score for the hotel with the casino and that's how I arrived at two stars.\n\nI do hope they redeeem this place, but since they wont I say let's go ahead and implode the sucker before it gets any more pathetic."
1,"Fusion places have become increasing popular in Las Vegas. When I heard about a new Japanese Italian fusion restaurant, I was curious to check it out. \n\nThe restaurant is located in the same shopping center as Raku, Monta Noodle and Big Wong so it's in great company. It's small with about nine tables and a bar. The ambiance is simple and modern.\n\nI ordered ginger ale and it wasn't the regular stuff you can buy at the supermarket. It was Fever Tree Ginger Ale and it was so, so good! \n\nThe buns they provide as an appetizer were fresh, warm and delicious. (I didn't get a chance to take note of the proper names of the menu items so pardon me if I don't get the names correct.) We started off with Jidori Chicken which translates to \""organic chicken\"" per the waitress. It was good but not memorable. \n\nMy husband ordered the Miso Carbonara ($13.95) and he enjoyed it. I ordered the Fettucini with Baby Scallops and Tarako (?) sauce ($18.95). Again, I apologize if I get the names wrong. I really enjoyed my dish. The pasta was cooked perfectly as were the scallops and the sauce was indescribable. I really tasted the Italian and Japanese influence in the dish.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the Tiramisu. It was good, not too sweet, but it wasn't the best Tiramisu I ever had.\n\nI would give the service 5 stars because the waitresses were very sweet and attentive. They were wonderful about explaining the menu items to us, our glasses were never empty and they kept our table clean.\n\nI would suggest to sign up for their e-mail distribution because they change out their pasta menu every few weeks. I can't wait to see what else they have to offer!"
1,"$35 dinner buffet with crab legs and bone marrow?  I was sold.\n\nI came, I saw, I conquered the buffet.\n\nAll the items tasted were pretty good.  The crab legs were standard, some pieces were a bit salty but i guess that's how they get you. Salty+water = full. NOT ME!  Power through.\n\nThe shrimp cocktail are pretty large and fresh.  They put them in little shot cups so that you eat less. NOT ME! The prime rib is pretty tender and juicy.  I asked for the rare cuts in the middle.  Delicious. The burrata salad was a big hit at my table.  \n\nThe bone marrow was pretty straight forward.  Cut up bone with .... (get ready for it)......marrow inside.  Good if you like buttery stuff, you can also slab it all over bread, if you plan on wasting space in your stomach.  \n\nThe hot items are all prepared pretty well.  Good potato gratin, risotto, sushi (spicy tuna), tender mussells and clam dishes.  The desserts are pretty good and the gelato bar is always appreciated at the end.  Wish they had a bit more seafood, but I'm not complainin!"
0,"Circus Vargas\n$$$$ Please be aware and let family and friends be aware for wherever this circus travels.... I was just notified from my bank of fraudulent activity. It was traced back from the circus from when they were here in Scottsdale. When my husband purchased popcorn and drinks, the 'kid' who took the debit/credit card  also took the card info. I would not post this if I did not know for sure. There procedure for credit/debit cards is shady. They tried to use card at many gas stations , etc. \n\nIf you saw the show in AZ go check your bank statements. If you know of anyone going to the show in any city that circus will be traveling to....make sure they pay in cash for everything they purchase!"
0,"I guess this is the fancy Italian chain restaurant.  While it is better than say Olive Garden or Carrabbas, that is not saying much.  On top of that it is just to expensive for what you get.  That fake, country rustic vibe is prevalent throughout.  \n\nService is cheerful and peppy.  For a large group they did fine.  Everything from the kitchen came out at the same time.  Which is professional, though some things were cold.  Understandable, but I wish places like this would just bring the food out when it is hot.  Maybe I am alone in that regard, because most places will do this.  Anyway, that really is not a big deal.\n\nThey shout from the highest high top table that everything is freshly made or sourced here.  If that is true, they need better sources or they need to make better pasta.  Just the typical over stuffed pasta dishes that are found in most Italian places.  The scallops are bad.  Rubbery, chewy, and flavorless.  The salads are not that good...the dreaded and bland Caesar, house, and wedge.  Calamari is dry, rubbery, and flavorless.  Average wine list, and a crappy beer list.  Both pretty typical for such a place.  \n\nThere are not a lot of great options for Italian in Champaign/Urbana/Savoy.  This place certainly has that faux chain look that draws people in by the masses.  Which is probably why they have been open for so many years.  Though just an upscale Olive Garden.  Manzella's is about the same, with a much friendlier, welcoming vibe (if a bit dated), and better bang for your buck IMO."
0,I wish I can write a good review despite the fact the lady owner is nice. I agree with some of reviewers that this place is a bit pricely for breakfast. For two people my bill was twenty dollars and I just ordered  two regular breakfast entrees and coffees and I think the owner overcharged my bill. I rather have a business gains loyalty first then people will come and eat eventually. The portion of the good wasn't huge and I didn't ordered the 3.99 special. For 5.99 I expect better portion. Next time I will for to I Hop and Panera for better food and quality. Not going there again.
0,"This is by far the worst hotel on the strip. First of all, the parking garage is a nightmare. Be prepared for no parking and a bunch of dead ends. I requested a non-smoking room and they put us in a smoking room. We walked into the room and our eyes burned. The manager said that the best he can do is have housekeeping spray air freshener...that helped for maybe a minute. He was EXTREMELY rude and had a big attitude. Double bolt your doors because someone opened our door in the middle of the night. Do yourselves a favor and pay the extra $50 a night and stay somewhere safe and where they value their customers."
0,"I am not sure why other people gave this restaurant more that 2 stars. I had a terrible dinner.\n\n The appetizer called a Charcuterie plate was dry, bland toast triangles, squares  of cheese like we used to have in high school, some dried cranberries and almonds. \n\nTheir Twisted Burger, which was supposed to be their specialities, had so much overly sweet onion jam, barely cooked bacon, unmelted cheese and tons of mayo that it was inedible.. The fries were cold. And the most surprising part was the wine pour, barely 3 oz. in a big wine glass. The owner was running the bar. and the waitress told us that's all  he allowed.  The wine was really good, and was from their own winery. You would think they would give at least a normal pour as bottles are available for purchase. Talk about poor marketing!  After commenting to the waitress, the second glass had a little more. I asked to taste a wine and was told the bottle wasn't open and i would have to order a glass. Wouldn't it have made more sense to open the bottle, as I may have purchased it or at least had 1-2 glasses. Poor marketing again.\n\nThis was the second time I tried this restaurant, knowing it was bad the first. But wanted to give them another chance as they were new the first time.  I would have thought they would cater more to their patrons, as this time of the year, most of us in AZ are residents and it could become one of our favorites.  I hate to see restaurants destroy themselves when a new chef and some better customer service, along with a customer-friendly owner could surely help.\n\n* By the way, the food pictures below were not even on the menu."
1,I love this place. Great atmosphere great food and friendly staff. I have had there fish and chips (Best in Phoenix). Mouth watering burgers and awesome loaded potato skins.\n\nGreat place to go for dinner or just go out for a beer. This is my favorite place on mill.
0,The worst burger king I ever been to ! I love burger king and the wackest one is by my house (this one). Its empty for a reason and the employees seem careless. Service is slow  even if your the only customer. Food isnt fresh . Shameful.
0,"you call this sushi?\n\ntheir O-toro didn't come close to some other places ive been to that are like half the price. it wasn't that fatty. a huge disappointment.\n\ntheir fish isn't that fresh. the uni wasn't that good. the amaebi tasted weird. i had to mix it in my mouth with ginger to put it down. \n\nonce again, the only asians there. . ."
1,"Pizza in the CU seems to be an overall disappointment. We like Papa Del's, but it is pricey and takes forever to deliver, and although we like Jupiter's and Timpone's for a good thin crust, they are more involved than a simple good delivery or quick bite.\n\nStepping into that gap, my wife and I find Papa Murhpy's convenient and tasty. Their veggie delite is great. What I like about the pizza is that the toppings are good, particularly the ample fresh veggies. \n\nOne of their pizzas has a garlic sauce that we also like.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but these pizzas seem much less oily and overall slightly healthier than what we get when we order out, and of course in baking ourselves get second to none freshness.\n\nSo, we've had great experiences here and really enjoyed the flavors, and also feel that we've ate (slightly) healthier and saved some money. It also doesn't hurt that we're a mile away and we can grab one on a trip to Schnuck's."
0,The food is over priced for the size of portion that is received.  Also no chips and salsa except on Friday and Saturday night.  But the worst thing is the owner.  He is such a rude jerk.  I have dined here for the last time.
1,"Most of the stores had a lot of sales going on. They had mostly high end stores like BCBG, French connection and Tommy Bahamas but they also had H&M and Sketchers which had a lot of 70% off sales. If you are at Planet Hollywood and need to buy a new outfit after upchucking the night prior all over your luggage, it would be a good place to find something. Just saying. Not that I'd know from personal experience. ;)"
0,"I have a love hate relationship with this bar. I love the drinks specials but I hate the crowd. My friends love this bar so I come here for moral support and for some reason I can't pass up .25 cent drinks. For .25 cents you get what you pay for you probably get half a shot per drink but after 3 or 4 of these suckers you should have a good buzz. There is a weird mix of people here you've got the cowboys, hoochies, thugs, Scottsdale brats, and some regular people here and there. If you're young and single this is a good bar to hook up I always see people getting freaky on the dance floor. Stay for the bikini contest at midnight its very entertaining."
0,"Found this place in yelp since  it's closer to Grandview hotel where we are staying. Pretty legit filipino food but if you come hungry, I would recommend to order more. We ordered tokwa't baboy for $3.99 and there were only 2 slices of meat (so sad). Java plate rice with chicken is also pretty tiny. You get out of there feeling hungry still."
0,"I  had the same experience as John V in that there was only one person working and \""She was cooking, bartending, handling money, scratching her head, shaking hands, cleaning bar tops, running dishes, etc.... read more \u00bbdid I mention she did not wash her hands once during this whole time? We ate our dinners, disgustedly, thinking how an inspector would shut the place down immediately if they saw it. She was entertaining, all over the place, yelling, throwing things, etc.\"" on our day, she was so drunk/on it, that she poured at least half a bottle of wine on our burgers and side of onions, but they were tasty, the most yummy burger and sauteed onions (they ended up purple!) i've ever had. it was so delicious i forgot about how unsanitary the place was...to bad she's the only one who cooks the burgers like that, must be the altered state 'o mind. i'd go back again, after a few drinks."
1,"This place is great! The service is quick and friendly, and the portions are huge. I ordered a soup and sandwich for lunch and the soup came in the biggest bowl I have ever seen. I was full before I even got to the sandwich! (But ate it anyways, I could never pass up a BLT)\n\nI have been a few times now and they are always very accommodating with substitutions and special requests. The burgers and omelettes also have large portion sizes. I will definitely be returning!"
1,"My friend and I went here for my birthday. I don't remember much because I'm just remembering that I didn't leave a review lol. I can say that this place is over priced but the food is good. I believe we went to Pure immediately after. I had the BBQ chicken pizza which was sooo good. I love red onions with BBQ chicken. My friend had a pasta dish with mac & cheese balls. Heard no complaints from her but I believe we ordered something else but ended up not receiving it because the server gave us a red velvet cupcake on the house. Which was cool since it was my birthday and my friend just had her birthday a few days before me. I really wanted to try the drinks and couture pops but didn't  get a chance to. \n\nThere's always next time but I don't like how romantic the vibe is. What do I look like going to Vegas with a male? Some vacation spots (to me) are places that you take your significant other... and then there are hot spots. When you are young, Vegas is a hot spot. So the fact that it was dim as hell annoyed me since I was dining with my female friend. The last thing that we wanted was a romantic dinner lol."
0,"#1 sign that a sushi place is going to suck: no Asians. anywhere. customers or employees. Not being racist (I'm Filipino... but I can tell the difference between a Korean \""sushi\"" place and a Japanese one...ya know?)\n\nAnywho.\n\nFood was overpriced and just OK.  The lady looked at me like I was crazy when I asked if they had a Chirashi bowl.  I ended up ordering a Sashimi Salad that was DROWNED in ponzu (love ponzu... don't need to be swimming in it).\n\nWe also ordered a Chicken Teriyaki Plate, Spicy Tuna Hand Roll, Saba Nigiri, Japanese Lasagna, Spicy Scallop Roll and Fried Banana dessert. $90 for 2 1/2 people (count our 3-year old as a half person since all she eats is rice and dessert) Wasn't terrible, but probably won't be coming back here again."
1,"How can anyone not love Costco?\n\nThe prices are amazing. The selection varies from time-to-time, with your favorites being there every time. \n\nThere are so many people to see. The free samples are amazing. Spending 2 minutes in the produce and dairy freezers will rejuvenate, refresh and cool you off in a heartbeat.\n\nYou can get dinner for four for less than $12 AND get your household and grocery shopping done all at the same time.\n\nI love Costco.\n\nThe staff is always helpful and happy, have good attitudes and are fast too."
0,"This is the kind of place I feel like I should be enjoying myself more than I actually am. When I first checked out this establishment, I didn't really know it was the T & A \""Hooters\"" style establishment with Scottish remix. I certainly didn't shy away from having hot eye candy serving me and they have plenty of that going on for them. But seeing how I am not really a Hooters fan (who really goes for the \""wings\"" that food is terrible) I feel like this establishment had a great opportunity to capture me as a fan. It is fairly spacious on the inside so would be nice spot to have a guy's night out. They also typically show most UFC\\Boxing and other major sporting events (although there may be a cover) so that was a big plus for me. The menu is much more dynamic than the competition and prepared quite well.  They even have fast free wi-fi guest network named \""Hooters Suck\"" which gave me a nice chuckle. So why only two stars you may be wondering? The service is flat out abysmal. I've come during peak times and off peak times but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I can't tell you how many times I've went in and there would be no greeter at the front, sit down at a table and never have one waiter to even ask if I'm being helped. The wait for food is fairly sluggish. I order a mixed drink that clearly wasn't the correct one and I had my kilt gal proceed to tell me that I was wrong even though everybody at my table agreed with my assessment. All it did was prolong it getting fixed when I continued to complain about it. And they always have the AC on full blast so I have to bundle in layers while 90% of the staff is half naked (I guess it keeps them wanting to move or stay \""perky\"") I do like the concept and i'm hopeful mgmt. will work to improve service as it has plenty of potential. For now, I can't really recommend this place beyond maybe just having a quick beer at the bar. At the end of the day, I'm will to give up some beauty for brains and sense enough to treat their customers better."
0,"I have been a customer of Red hut for a few months and have never had a poor experience there until this morning. The girl that was working was a gem and ive seen her there many times before, always kind, happy and energetic. I was sitting in the corner when all of the sudden a man storms in and starts verbally attacking the girl that was working. He was seemingly the manager or owner of the place and was yelling about something. The girl who was working remained well mannered while this man was clearly making her uncomfortable. Ive worked in the service industry before and have never seen someone so upset at an employee in front of paying customers. I am very embarrassed for this man and will never return."
0,After reading the reviews I didn't think it would be true for those who rated the store a 1 store. If I could I would rate them a ZERO.  I went in there with my husband and family hoping ill be able to purchase my very first pair of LB. waited around to be helped and having someone help you was impossible. I shouldn't have to ask two or three associate if they could help me get the size I need. They are just rude stuck up and snotty.  To be a high end boutique this is the worst service I have ever had. I walked out with nothing because to come to think of it why would I want to spend my money there. Management should really think about training their staff on customer service. If they don't like their job much this isn't the industry for them.
1,"The husband came here for dinner on a Sunday evening around 6pm. Not really busy and were seated quickly by our waiter. He was very nice and very professional and willing to give recommendations. We had the cheesy fries that were delicious. They were topped with fresh cheese and  bacon so we had to eat them quickly so the cheese would stay 'stringy' and the bacon was nice and crispy. Also had an order of wings which were good just wish we would have ordered the hot or the pineapple habanero I think was the other hot flavor. Other than them not having any spice they were cooked perfectly crispy and no oil dripping like some places. Next time we will order the hot ones! I order the 2 angus slider and they were pretty simple but tasty. Some sort of sauce that is not overpowering, grilled onions and the meat in a nicely toasted buttered bun. I order the house margarita to go along with it and it was delicious. Served in a cute mason jar and was pretty strong for being on happy hour special. The husband got the pastrami sandwich and he loved it. I snuck a taste and I'm not a fan of mustard but other than that it was really good and good size portions. Some things are a little pricey but the overall quality of everything was great, super fresh and they have happy hour EVERYDAY which is usually unheard of on the weekends which is very nice. Cool little bar in our area and will gladly be back to try different items on the menu"
0,"Note to self: ALWAYS listen to Amanda B.\n\nI spent a few hours at Drip recently, needing to get away from the Hubby, who is on a real vacation, not a working \""vacation\"" as this teacher always is. Damned evaluations...\n\nAnyway, Drip was pretty full when I arrived at 11:00, and remained fairly so until I left 3 hours later. The iced latte I had might just leave me with a bleeding ulcer, but on the other hand, the cucumber, havarti, spinach, and cream cheese sandwich I had was freaking awesome. \n\nThe atmosphere was pretty industrial, with an awkward second room which also contained the single unisex bathroom with a separate sink just outside the enclosed stall. Really, Drip. This feels like one small step above a porta-potty. The chairs were not entirely uncomfortable, but just enough so that it kept me working. No squishy nappy-time seats here, except for one boxy couch. I suppose that's good. But sorry, Drip. Pair the whole experience with your lame hours and poor acoustics, and I can't see myself returning."
1,"Back in the Sad Days, I would have to wait an entire year to go to Steak n Shake. I would travel to Indianapolis and eat there as much as I possibly could because I knew I would not be there again for another year.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, my life was lived improperly. No man should be deprived of steak burgers and oreo milkshakes for a whole year and thus Las Vegas - specifically the South Point Hotel and Casino (which fortuitously happens to be one of the FIRST hotels you reach coming from Los Angeles) has stormed its way into my life and slapped my hopes and dreams into reality. \n\nFrisco Melt is now on crunchy sourdough - IMPROVEMENT\nthe $4 meal deals are still intact - EXCELLENT VALUE\nHappy Hour of half-priced shakes - POSITIVE ENERGY EVERYWHERE\n\nThis has instantly become a staple of mine and I will literally go to vegas more often simply because of this restaurant. If I could give this six stars I would."
0,"I'm really surprised that so many people love this place, especially when there is better middle eastern food all over this town.\n\nFirst off, I didn't really know who worked here, and who didn't, and thought it was especially rude of the gangsta busboy to cut me off and flirt with our hostess while she was seating us. Classy. \n\nThe decor is uninspired, and the service was decent. Our drinks were kept full, but I felt that our plates were thrown at us. \n\nOnto the food. We first started with the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus, which was a pretty decent hummus, not as spicy as I would have liked. It was smooth\n\nMy wife had the Spicy Black Bean Burger, and I had the Falafel Pita.\n\nPresentation was nothing special, the idea of putting my foil wrapped pita on a plate seemed ridiculous, it would have made better sense to put it in a basket, or just handed it to me. As for flavor, nothing was exciting, minus the pickles, which were crisp and sour. The falafel tasted like a mix, the pita was dry and incredibly flat, the tahini was non-existent, and the way my veggies were arranged showed the general lack of care/love of food in the kitchen.\n\nThe black bean burger was much better, and is what earned the 2 stars in this review. The patty was flavorful, spicy, and great. The rest of the burger was uninspired. Vegetarian food can be absolutely amazing, and the rest of burger was a miss. \n\nShe enjoyed the included blue corn chips, but I thought they were nothing special, the salsa was salty, and the potatoes were not spiced, burnt, and really had no place or reason to be included with the meal. \n\nI certainly won't be going back, but if I could purchase just those black bean burger patties, I would."
0,"couldn't wait to try this place from the time i heard they were turning the motorcycle dealer into a \""beer garden\"".  Food was so-so, drinks way over-priced and the atmosphere was noisy and very impersonal - not at all the \""beer garden\"" atmosphere i was expecting. The \""yard\"" area leaves a lot to be desired as there is no organization to the games...where do you go to check out equip? no one around to ask, no signs, nada.  The parking?! a complete nightmare - negative 10 stars on that point.  Probably won't be going back, too many other nice, convenient places opening in the neighborhood."
1,Yummy Tapas in a relaxing environment. Highly recommended!!
0,"Never cared for this joint. Full of Guidos (Tony, Joey or Pauly) all doing their fiercest Tony Soprano impersonation. I haven't seen this much BIG hair on the ladies since 1987. Love that blue eye shadow Teresa!\n\nGreat view of the fountains from the Aladdin (Planet Hollywood-yuk!) though so I suppose it has some redeeming qualities. The fountain is the only one that comes to mind at this juncture. \n\nI always wonder if some of these sycophantic reviews are post by employees or stockholders! Perhaps it's just that I've seen behind the curtain to behold the wizard.\n\nPerhaps it's that I don't swoop into town hoping to defile myself and others in a drug and alcohol crazed marathon blowing the kiddos' college money on coke and hookers then slither back home hoping the wife doesn't notice the various oozing sores and pustules on my nethers.  \n\nYou decide for yourself but take hand sanitizer at the very least. I'm so over this town."
0,"Such a crazy name for a restaurant in the Hooters hotel.  The star deal of this place are the 25 cents wings that are offered after midnight, which trust me, is better off sober and not drunk.\n\nThe place gets pretty busy after midnight because of the deal, so you could be waiting anywhere from ten minutes to an hour for a seat.  For my experience, I really just wanted to tackle these wings that I've heard so much about.\n\nWhen you order the wings, you need to buy them in sets of ten (so $2.50 per batch), and you select a style of flavoring.  The mild flavored were pretty disgusting because they were so buttery, and really upsets your stomach if you are wasted beyond belief.  My friends and I ordered the BBQ and Spicy wings.  Be warned that these wings are different from other Hooters restaurants.  The wings themselves weren't that great, and really greasy.  And if you add too much hot sauce on these wings, they will really mess you up if you are drunk.\n\nThis wasn't quite the drunk-food I was looking for during the evening, so I would pass for something else if you could.  Oh well, at least it was cheap."
1,"It is very very rare that I ever experience perfect customer service.  But tonight we definitely did! Our doors got opened for us, seated right away, we had the best server...nice short chats, refilled waters when needed, and everyone thanked us as we exited.  Food was good. Nothing too fancy but very good.  I usually get the grilled salmon, but decided to go with the new item \""firecracker salmon\"" and that was much better than the grilled salmon. We will definitely be coming back for good food and good customer service"
0,"This place is gross.  We were in Vegas with my boyfriend's parents for Thanksgiving (yes, I know this is weird) and my boyfriend's dad really likes buffets.  He is diabetic and likes the variety and that he can find things friendly to his intense diet.  I, on the other hand, do not have such dietary restrictions, and just found this food to be disgusting.  I got a little bit of a few different things (some sort of steak, pizza, corn, a roll, mashed potatoes) and everything was so bland, salty and improperly cooked that I just couldn't do it.  I started getting a headache from the amount of salt in everything.  The desserts were decent and I had a bunch of melon alongside some forgettable but palatable sweets.  I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
1,Food was cooked well and the service was fast and good.  It was not very busy for a Thursday night so we were able to get in and out while still enjoying our meal.
0,"Nothing has improved. Every time I have brought my car in for service, I bring it home with the problem not fixed or another problem created. I purchased a new navigation DVD for $200', only to get home and see it wasn't working. They never checked it and it was a defective DVD. That is just one example of many things they have not completed properly. Looks like I am going to take the long route and start bringing my car \nto BMW North Scottsdale. Hopefully, I will have better luck."
1,"This is such a pretty little brunch place! I saw it on yelp when staying the weekend at my boyfriends place and felt it was on the yelpery of my 'have not trieds' list. I did not find the place to be slow..but maybe because I was having a much needed date with my much busy boyfriend and my much busy self. IF it were slower than say , Denny's. Well... suck it up and slow down and enjoy your coffee, impatient consumers. The food is fresh and very good. The portions are huge. \nI would improve on the presentation a little of the ice/water/ice tea/lemonade/coffee station. That felt very much like a potluck at a southern church to me. I would also offer more offerings of espresso drinks on the menu.Add some nicer cream and nicer creamers; agave sweetener and raw sugar.  I don't think people would have an issue spending for that. As the station mentioned above is all complimentary. Also when I asked for jam for the divine flaky biscuit, a treat I never allow myself, as I am gluten free for most of my life with the disclaimer of 'slip ups' on the monthly! .. I was given a Smuckers jam that I could find at any kiosk at any walk up bar in any hotel or McDonalds. Hmmmm... a place as pretty as this needs to square up with one of the farmers wives and get some fresh honey and jam on the table! Little touches would make this place a 5 in my book. But the meal was superb. Hands down one of the best places for a nice leisurely brunch on the weekend ONLY in the area."
1,"After reading & hearing such great reviews, I finally got to try this sushi joint. \n\nI'd have to agree with many yelpers that the GARLIC CHICKEN was deelish!! \n\nThe rolls were yummy especially the  KILAUEA ROLL !  And I'm spoiled with a list of special rolls from yama sushi but its nice that this place keeps it SIMPLE. \n\nI may not be back due to the fact that its across from town from my place but I would definitely like to try their new spot in summerlin 808 TAPAS."
1,"Studio 3-26 is legit!  I get my haircut by Luis and haven't been disappointed once!  I was nervous, just having moved to Phx to try someone new, but Peter, the owner, recommended him and he lived up to his billing!\nEvery stylist there is talented and friendly....you can tell they all enjoy what they do and where they're at.  Peter has done an awesome job at finding the right group of stylists that genuinely care about the quality of their work.\n\nHighly, highly recommend.  Any guy looking for a good cut, go see Luis!"
0,Very overpriced average food- definitely a tourist trap. \nThe wines were ridiculously expensive. $14 for a glass of bordeaux? \nC'mon!\n\nThe best thing we got from the restaurant servers were recommendations for bars and lounges on Crescent St.
0,"We just received terrible service at Grand Canyon JCP Portrait studio. I was running late for session with my two babies. I was total late for 6 min and manager Christine terribly blew us off.  Wow :(  They already had a couple of customers   when we walked in and it was obvious that something got messed up in their timing. She looked very stressed out and raised her voice on us saying that they wont take us in and we have to re-schedule despite of my explanation that we are just 6 min late and it's hard with two babies. She said that she has 20 min per customer and we are too late, she is not going to take us in.  It was a Groupon deal. I'm not coming back and I'm telling all my friends about this rude service. It takes away all the joy of getting pictures taken."
1,"For a place that's supposed to be your typical local neighborhood chinese restaurant, I was highly impressed. The restaurant's interior design is pleasant, with television. I came during lunch, and they have to have one of the most outstanding lunch specials I've seen for a chinese restaurant. \n\nDepending on what you get, I got the vegetable lunch special. It came with an eggroll, your choice of soup, choice of white or fried rice, and the entree itself was filling! The only thing I didn't like were the vegetables soaked in grease. \n\nService was on point, I felt like the guy was at my table whenever I was done with a plate or if I looked like I wanted a question. Felt like I was the most important woman in there! Great experience, if you're looking for a local chinese restaurant that's a little more upscale in looks and service, give this place a try."
0,"First and foremost I want to say that I've attended insomniac events for about 6 years. I have patiently and calmly overlooked many fiascoes at their events. Hazardous lines, terrible communication with event staff, poor ticketing strategies..etc... I remained faithful through all our ups and downs, even suggesting events to friends, \n---\n\n\n\nAfter EDC Las Vegas all I had were my comparisons to other Insomniac events. Namely, EDC Los Angeles which I attended faithfully as well. In Vegas, I thought the transportation to the venue was terrible. A 2 hour shuttle ride to the venue each night going ever so slowly. The venue itself is massive, great venue, but its in butt fuck nowhere. It was not well lit inside between the stages and did not have the same feel as other events. That being said Friday was ok. The vibes were OK. \n\n---\n\n\nSaturday, I'm sure we all know what happened Saturday by now...All I can say is I've been to more than 1 HARD event that was shut down due to fans rushing in and cops being called yet HARD still refunded everyone's money or gave the option of a free ticket to another event. INSOMNIAC however denies that the event was cancelled or postponed which is very insulting. I personally asked 4 police officers if the event was cancelled and 2 workers at the event who all informed me it\n was. They even stopped letting people outside into the venue. \n---\nAt the end of the weekend I would have rather stayed in LA saved $800 bucks (thats hard on a college student) and paid for HARD SUMMER which is still in LA and poppin!\n---\nSunday was great. Now, Sunday felt like EDC. However, I paid a total of $753.53 for two tickets to see FERRY CORSTEN (My favorite DJ) Tiesto and Markus Schulz, Jack Beats, the Blue Man Group. And didn't get to see ANY OF THOSE. that Sucks bawlz. Y'know. So to send a statement saying we understand but we're keeping your money I'm sorry nature is a b****. Really read to me like. \n\n\""I'm sorry we didn't check the weather, we're keeping you're money although it was our shortcoming.\"" I only wanted a refund for that day. In which I took the bus another 2 hours got in for 20 mins before the event closed.\n----\nNot to mention the complete and utter lack of information anyone at the event had. It was like \""Excuse me where is Lot 9\"" \""We don't know, go up to every shuttle and ask.\""\n\nOr the, \""We don't know where the bathrooms are. ... I think there's a water stations that way...\""\n\nNeedless to say, that was my last Insomniac event & the end of our 6 year relationship. In my world relationships are give and take, I gave them money in exchange for entertainment. And all they did was take it... \n---\n\n\nThere are more fish in the sea Insomniac, HELLLO HARD EVENTS!\n---\n\nN"
1,"Getting obsessed with Sichuan food recently; this place is authentic and SPICY. Small and uncrowded, as close as In-N-Out and cheaper than Smashburger for lunch. Infinitely better and comparably priced to Panda in the SU. \n\nI've been here twice now and had the following:\n\nSichuan chopped chicken - comes on a bed of dried chilis, great and peppery. Chicken was a bit bony, though. This is ostensibly their signature and it definitely tastes great and leaves your tongue pleasantly numb.\n\nSichuan twice-cooked pork - Fantastic lunch special dish, spicy in all the right ways.\n\nEggplant in spicy garlic sauce - not nearly as hot as the above two dishes, but amazingly savory and visually stunning. Almost my favorite dish, but it's hard to pick when everything is so good."
1,"A Friday night favorite for my husband and I since we moved to Charlotte- we started out going to the Tryon location, but now visit the Pineville location on a regular basis because it's closer to our new home. Both locations offer excellent service and great food at reasonable prices. I think on the whole I give the edge to the Pineville location, as they actually have better rice and a few additional things on the menu that the Tryon location doesn't offer.\n\nIf you're looking for some of the more authentic dishes, ask to see the picture menu- it offers several dishes that aren't on the english menu (at least at the Pineville location).\n\nIf you're looking for value, you cant go wrong with the combination platters- it's a ton of food for super cheap (especially if you go for lunch). And of course, every meal starts with free chips and salsa (two different kinds, a true salsa and a pico de gallo). They also make all their tortillas fresh, and at the Pineville location you can watch them being made at an open station near the kitchens."
1,"Living down the street, the wife and I have wanted to try this place for a long time.  My parents visiting town for her birthday proved to be the perfect occasion\n\nWe started with the dad's grocery bag appetizer which was an excellent start\n\n\nI had the ribs, which were so tender I didn't need a knife, they split once the fork hit. The jalepeno grits were also a nice addition \n\n\nFor desert the key lime pie was a very refreshing treat. Everyone was also raving about the coffee which was  fantastic and came with a very real cream.\n\nOur server Jake was wonderful- prompt, friendly, kept my soda full and made good recommendations. \n\nWill be back!"
1,"The pancakes were amazing. Really. Every once in a while I get an inexplicable, sudden craving for pancakes and MUST EAT THEM IMMEDIATELY. It makes me very happy to know that I have an option for tasty, 24 hour pancakes within walking distance of my apartment. I also had an omelet and some hash browns and those were good but the pancakes are what I remember most. A little on the pricey side, but no worse than the crazy-expensive IHOP on Las Vegas Blvd... and waaay tastier!"
1,"Love this restaurant.  Fantastic apps, service, and atmosphere.  My go to with my husband on date night!"
1,"As a bar, this place actually has the propensity to be something incredible.  As it is, it's really chill and great and I like to kick it there when I have a chance.  With a few slight modifications, I could picture Time Out Lounge being transformed into my permanent hang out.\n\nYou ever seen that movie Mean Streets?  I could totally see me being Harvey Keitel and Time Out Lounge being my permanent hangout spot.\n\nI love the amount of pool tables and the dartboard and the internet jukebox.  I like the whole layout of the bar.  It's very cool and most of the bartenders are really nice.  One of my favorite touches is the tables that have endless amounts of various graffiti in the form of \""fuck you's\"" \""so-and-so was here\"" and strange political points and counterpoints that it all blends together into a nonsensical collage of intoxication.\n\nBrilliant.\n\nThe bathrooms are awesome.  There are murals that have a lot going on.  It's really fantastic after you've had a few pitchers.\n\nIf you're ever in this part of Tempe and want to have a couple beers and shoot pool, Time Out will do a damn good job."
1,"Kassab's is one of my favorite places for lunch on the Southside of Pittsburgh.  Great ambiance with perfect lightning and the huge colorful wall mural/painting (wow - I remember the hole-in-the-wall old location on the corner many years ago - monumental improvement to say the least).  Kassab's usually has very quick and friendly service despite the fact that the 1 or 2 servers are covering a very busy lunch crowd. I always seem to get my unsweetened ice tea refilled once or twice just when I need it.  I need to expand and explore the selection of dishes that I try at Kassab's.  I usually go with the lamb pita sandwich (with no cheese) - incredible.  This does NOT seem like a healthy option because they cook the ground lamb with a quite a bit of oil but very yummy.  The add a touch of hummus on the lamb sandwich which makes it perfect.  Another favorite at Kassab's is the baba ganoush with pita.  I have mixed feelings and results from the falafil pita sandwich at Kassab's - I am pretty picky about my falafil.  The Kassab's version is huge compared to most but could sometimes use a little more flavor, sometimes a tad mushy.  I think there are better falafil options in Squirrel Hill - hey maybe a Talk thread is in order on this topic!   Similar to some other Yelpers, I am NOT a big fan of warm grape leaves from Kassab's (and the tabouli could use a little kick in the @$$) but perhaps those 2 are made in the Lebanese style?  I am looking forward to trying new things on the menu someday soon!"
1,"Great tacos and amazing horchata! \n\nThe salsa bar was fresh, and it was really fun to try out different salsas. The Horchata and the Jamaica come in huge cups and are both excellent. I had the Mayan pork and Chicken mole tacos. They were delicious and filling."
1,"So Marcus, the owner, saw my wife and I passing by starring into his sandwhich shop and poked his head out the window amd said \""We make a really mean grilled cheese, come on in\"". Graz just opened on Monday apparently he tells us as we skimmed over the menu. We decided to take his recommendations, the \""BL cheese\"" and the \""flying pig\"".\nSo freaking good. I really digged the BL cheese (hot sandwhich w/ cheddar tomatoes, mixed greens h bacon on sourdough). Tasted nice and fluffy not greasy like I was expecting. \nThe Flying pig  was really good too, Havarti cheese was a great touch but not sure how some people would feel about the herb spread. Can be strong for some. Reminded me of a strong honey mustard. \n\nOverall, definitely coming back. Would like to continue to support local business that has a great product. Come if your interested in a gourmet home cooked sandwhich"
1,"Falafel was outstanding. Whatever you order (I love the kababs), order some on the side. The tahini will even come in handy with the chicken.\nHummus is good - but not amazing. Needs to be a tad more creamy. That's my only teenie complaint.\nMy only real issue: the table buzzer scares the crap out of me every time it goes off!\nEnjoy..."
0,"First off, I am always a supporter of \""Mom and Pop\"" businesses and when I heard the story behind Dessy's I had to check it out. I have to be honest though. It wasn't that good. \n\nWe went in about 7pm on a weekday, it was empty inside and the employees working seemed preoccupied with cleaning and preparing to close the restaurant rather than wait on guests. Once we got situated our server was attentive though and provided decent service. I am in the restaurant industry and I know the difference between being an order taker and being a good server. That night we got order taker service. \n\nI ordered a steak, it was tough and more of the steak was not edible than was edible. The fries were good and the salad bar was just OK. There was not much of a selection and everything seemed to have been sitting out for quite a while. However, I understand why. They are a new establishment and they are trying to stay afloat in a crummy economy. They use lower quality cuts of beef, and try to keep as much food as possible from spoiling and are reusing what they can for as long as they can. \n\nA few tips to the management if you are reading this. Get some better cuts of meat, add more to the salad bar, refresh the food in the salad bar more often, and train your waiters to work more on impressing the guests and being more than an order taker and your business will be much better off. I am willing to give Dessy's another shot for sure though. Don't write this place off though. Give them some time to grow and mature as a business and you will have a decent place to grab a quick bite. Keep at it Dessy's, I want to see you suceed!!"
1,Best pizza I've found in Vegas.  I call in ahead and pick it up to go.  It's always ready when I get there and I've never had any issues with service.
1,"What?? As many times as I have been to Vegas, no one ever told me about Executive shuttle service.  I am sure I overlooked them because they look so regal and I never go to Vegas with anything close to regal money.  However, this last trip, I humored myself by checking out their prices and to my surprise they were $1 cheaper than Showtime (which I have always used).  \n\nThey issue a black poker chip for service to your destination and a white chip for service from your destination.  As soon as you leave the baggage claim area and head towards Ground Transportation, their desk is located outside.  You can't miss them, I promise.  All the vehicles I saw were black; black limosines, black hummers, black shuttle buses.  Go for the shuttle bus! The strip is just two miles away so there is no need to pay for anything that lavish just to go around the corner.\n\nMy return trip was phenomenal, as well.  They told me they would be outside at 11 AM and they were prompt.  I was assuming they would be late due to traffic on the strip, but apparently they had all that factored in.\n\nI was the first on the shuttle and they only made one other stop at an adjoining hotel before we headed to the airport.  Therefore, I made it to the airport in plenty of time to check-in for my flight."
0,"I saw Dr. Lucious Blanchard on 3-31-14 at the Tenaya location. I arrived at 12:30pm. My appointment was for 1:15pm. I left this office at 2:45pm. I was given a prescription cream to rub all over my body where there were rashes. He said it was severe eczema with a possible infection from scratching. \n\nI asked for antibiotics, he said no. Ask your primary care doctor. I told him I'm asking you for it because my primary care doctor won't give it to me because it has to do with these rashes, and the primary doctor's excuse is since it has to do with these rashes, and it's a dermatology specialist's concern, let him give you the antibiotics.\n\nSo, I have an infection from scratching all my \""eczema\"" rashes that look like measles or chicken pox, and neither my primary care doctor nor my dermatology specialist will give me a prescription for some antibiotics, just cream to rub all over my body. \n\nI filled the prescription for the cream, rubbed it on my rashes, and felt like a little worm tickling and crawling under my skin. I called my primary care doctor about it. He said call the specialist back. I called the specialist. They didn't return my call that week.\n\nI called my \""telephone advice nurse\"" to get approval to go to Urgent Care because it was the weekend, neither my primary care doctor nor the specialist addressed my concern about feeling like something is crawling underneath my skin and tickling. \n\nI get to Urgent Care, the nurse is being overly strong and stern with me with an accompanying Samoan, Mexican, or Philipino accent. His voice gets deep when asking me for a 2nd time straight \""When did it start.\"" I see the Asian female doctor in Urgent Care. She asks me \""Are you an alcoholic or hardcore drug abuser?\"" I said no.\n\nShe gives me a prescription for hydroxyzene to stop the itching from a severe allergic reaction brought on from rubbing cream on my \""severe eczema\"" rashes. The cream contained cortisone and hydrocortisone, which I'm allergic to, and what I filled out in the electronic tablet, told Dr. Blanchard's nurse, and mentioned to Dr. Blanchard himself. \n\nHow could this mistake have happened? It's May 14th. I have had this problem since February. I waited for my referall to be processed. I went to the specialist. Now I've been to a dermatology specialist 3 times. 3-31-14, 4-12-14, and 5-13-14. \n\nI stopped seeing Dr. Blanchard after his and his nurse's mistake. I reported them to HPN Member Services. I'm seeing Dr. Brent Michaels at the Rancho location of Las Vegas Skin & Cancer Clinics. I'm much more satisfied with Dr. Michaels after 2 visits. 1 for my rashes, and 1 for a biopsy. I've written a separate review for him."
1,"Nice machines, not too packed, and at $10 month? Yah, I'm a fan."
1,"Does my review even matter here where others have given their whole hearted stamp of approval?\n\nI live down the street from this small, family-run coffeeshop crepery, and have been going here since it opened several years ago.  \n\nI've had their savory crepes, the menu of which changes daily to account for the local, farm fresh and farmers' market obtained ingredients. \n\nI like how they always have great indie-emo music playing in the background, often bands that i like but have never heard of. \n\nCrepes are usually 6 to 8 bucks for the savory ones, they aren't filling enough for an entire meal if you're a tall dude, but for me, a petite little lady, it does make the tummy happy.  Always  good people watching potential from the window, and I like that you can sit at the counter looking out at the world or eat at their spanking new L shaped communal table.  The staff are always friendly (not to mention on the hot side, daddy hot)."
1,"What a cute little restaurant. I would rather eat here than Denny's or Ihop, anyday. The service is great, I've had the same waitress twice now and she is a joy to be around. She cares, she's honest and she treats EVERYONE great. The staff is fast and delightful to be around and the decor is laid back and cozy. They serve fresh and organic ingredients at a price that everyone can afford. It's a great restaurant for EVERYONE. I love it. \n\nBoth times I have ordered the Breakfast Special, $6 for eggs, bacon, sausage or turkey patty, breakfast potatoes, and a choice of a muffin, toast, fruit, pancakes and a few others. The eggs are always cooked just the way you order, the bacon is crispy and not greasy, the breakfast potatoes are savory and filling and the pancakes ARE THE BEST. I LOVE their pancakes. They're sweet all on their own and with syrup they create the ultimate dynamo! \n\nNo doubt I will be coming back here again and again!"
1,"Had this twice already - both times tried their discovery menu on different seasons.\n\nHighlights:\n- Fois Gras ravioli soup was memorable.  amazing broth, the mushrooms..yum.\n- their tiger prawns with cavier is something to just sit and really enjoy in life.\n- They fried this lotus root that went so well with cilantro.  Another classic work of art.\n- poached oysters were great\n- Overall all of their seafood in general is fabulous \n- Their baquettes are wonderful as well.\n\n\nOther areas:\n- I though the quail was just ok.  Maybe its a bit over-hyped?\n- The 5 course wine pairing is ok.  The Brut champagne was fantastic, but it seemed to go dull afterwards. \n- Didn't care too much for their desserts.\n\noverall a must try.    I think their wine pairing is a bit overpriced based on their selection of pairings they have for you."
1,"This place has officially taken the Number 1 spot on my Top AYCE sushi restaurants. So congrats Goyemon!\n\nAfter reading reviews I knew the wait was inevitable. This place is small! Very small space. Which explains the wait time. We got there and it was about a 35 minute wait but they do grab your number and text you when your table is ready. The text even says if you need a few minutes reply back and they'll wait 2 minutes. So don't wonder too far.\n\nAutomatically when we sit down someone takes our order. They must know the wait made us extremely famished! Ordered so many rolls (as seen in my pictures). I am a half roll kinda girl. I love getting half so I have more room to try different rolls. \n\nSome of my favorites were:\nSunrise Roll- This roll had cajun albacore (my fav), cucumber & avocado inside and its wrapped in tuna, yellowtail, shrimp, and white fish! I mean thats an amazing combo of fish. It taste so good! \n\n911 roll- Seriously the spiciest roll out there hands down. When we got it I thought, wow what a simple roll but boy I was wrong. It's spicy tuna with habanero sauce. Now I've had sushi rolls with habanero sauce before and it was NOT as spicy as this roll. This had my mouth on fire.... but in a good way! \n\nNigiri- Very fresh! The garlic tuna was to die for. And of course my favorite Cajun Albacore! \n\nSpider Roll- Very large roll of sushi wrapped in soy paper and not seaweed. Might need to bite it twice to finish. Very amazing flavors of the soft shell crab inside. BOMB! \n\nI honestly loved every single roll I tried. I wanted to keep eating but my stomach would't allow it. The presentation of the rolls and different colors of the fish used was beyond beautiful. I love when my food not only taste amazing BUT looks amazing. Even if I ordered half rolls of everything-- it looked just the same as if it was a full roll. \n\nservice was great! Thanks for a great experience Goyemon! See you for dinner next time for that green tea cream bruele !"
1,Gilbert is really a nice guy and very professional. He came on time of my flight. Fitted my luggage nicely. I had 5 huge luggage and some small ones too. He drives very carefully.

0,"I just recently moved to the Phoenix area and I was looking for a pizza place to try out, and Spinato's was suggested since the owners are from Chicago and so am I. People thought I would really enjoy the pizza because it has a Chicago taste. The service was decent and our waitress was nice. She seemed a bit stressed out because the restaurant was literally packed full. There was a wait to be seated but since I was just in a party of 2 they were able to seat us in the corner immediately. \n\nMost Italian restaurants I have been to give you bread and butter at your table for free but Spinato's charges $2 for their bread abd butter and when it came to the table I wanted to laugh. It looked like a mini kaiser loaf that had been cut into 5 pieces. Then we had to ask for Olive Oil and Parmasean...isn't that standard at Italian restaurants? \n\nWe ordered our pizza and when it came to the table we were ready to dig in and try this famous \""Chicago Style Pizza\"" but quickly we were disappointed. There was NO FLAVOR, all you could taste was sugar from the sauce. It did not taste like pizza at all...the sweetness of the sauce was just to overpowering. Had we not been hungry...we probably would have opted to not eat and just leave to try someplace else. It's a shame that this is supposed to be a Chicago style pizza because in Chicago, we definitely do not have sauce that sweet! The waitress clearly knew we were not satisfied, especially when she asked us if we wanted to box up the leftovers and my cousin said \""yea i guess we can find someone to feed it to\"". She just looked at us as if to say \""ok\"" but never asked us if there was a problem."
1,"Cornish Pasty food & service:  5/5  The Romper Room Effect 0/5\n\nWe had a late lunch around 1:30 on Easter Sunday and our server was great!  The receipt said his name was Johnny Cakes.  Somehow I doubt that's totally accurate, but hey....if it is, you go Johnny!  He was friendly and laid-back and took great care of us.  The pasties were great, as usual, and we also tried a side of their curry potatoes which were delicious!  If you like curry, these are cubed, perfectly roasted potatoes with a few roasted tomato bits as well.  They complimented the pasties and beer perfectly and I would definitely order them again.\n\nI know it was a Sunday.  I know it was Easter Sunday, but the amount of kids screaming and running around was appalling.   Take them to the park.  Take them home.  One inconsiderate mommy was wandering around carrying her beer, half-heartedly trying to corral Screamy and Sticky and if I heard her say one of the kid's names once, I heard her say it 400 times.  (Names changed to protect the inconsiderate).  Dudson.  Dudson.  Dudson.  Dudson.  Dudson.  Ad nauseam.  He's obviously not listening, but hey, get your buzz on.  Who cares.  Several children were crying loudly and the ones that were running around were frequently in the way of the entrance and patrons coming and going.  Ridiculous.\n\nWhen I'm managing my own restaurant I will politely pack their food up to go and give them clearly printed directions to the two or three nearest parks.   Letting your kids run around like wild animals is rude and inconsiderate and it's dangerous.  These are the same asshats who will sue you when their sweaty, foaming at the mouth kid falls and hurts themselves.  Send them to the park."
0,"I'm usually a fan of social; however, tonight was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. My girlfriend found what looked like a live caterpillar (possibly a maggot)  crawling through her salad. The service was slow the whole night and I had to basically chase down the waiter to inform him of the live creature in my girlfriends food while my girlfriend tried not to puke in the bathroom. I will never visit this restaurant again and hope that others will read this before accidentally being fed live maggots by this disgusting excuse for a restaurant."
0,"Aggressive prices, very nice support from Lee, John, Tammy and Joy -- BUT overall a bit disappointing.    I recommended them to our CEO and Sr. mgmt.  Collectively we were faced with Late pick-ups,  forgotten airport pick-ups, wrong vehicles for a long trip from Sky Harbor to Desert Ridge, cars with one head light out, no GPS...   Overall I've had better experiences with more reliable car services.  I would use them again but with caution."
0,"I've loved it and recommended it in the past, but no more. The Pizza di Fava arrived with charred pepperoni and the crust was undercooked and soggy. Not to mention , one plate arrived with a green food remnant on it. We will be going back to Grimaldi's."
1,"I have a feeling this bar isn't going to be another flash in the pan. They have a good location, a good layout, good prices and a good vibe. Cocktails for $5? Awesome. Good beer list? Great. They also have built in taps for table service. I don't like country music but it was still fun to watch people sing along and dance. For single ladies, there are a lot of really tall guys here. \n\nThe bartender we had was fast and attentive. My friend ordered some mudslide shots from another bartender. She stacked the three shots on top of each other, put them on the bar and pushed them towards us. Know your bar surface. Things aren't sliding on that bar top. So I was then wearing those three shots. The bartender took off so fast you'd think her pants were on fire. She didn't say I'm sorry. She didn't offer me a towel. She didn't offer me a drink. She didn't even acknowledge it happened. SO RUDE. Then the guy next to me asked another bartender for a napkin and he yelled back at him sorry dude we ran outta napkins three days ago. Then he came back with one he found, unrolled it in the guys face so the fork and knife dropped right in front of him and tossed it at him. Seriously?\n\nThey also ran out of coors light. \n\nSo some new bar problems they will overcome but they need to teach some of their bartenders some manners. I don't want to let those two ruin the rest of the experience so 4 stars!"
1,"super good food. i had the vegan wrap and it was amazing. alot of people were getting burgers, so i would say that this is a super upscale(valet parking) burger joint/bar. \nthe wait of over an hour was worth it and it was a really upbeat environment so it seemed like elss time had actually passed.\n\nloved it, ill deffenitely be back"
0,"I wanted to love this place, I really did, but I know a good blowout when I see one as I am pretty much addicted to them given my unruly curl. I was in Vegas tagging along with my man during a work conference of his. I was wanting hair as fabulous as my new dress and shoes so I decided that a blowout was definitely in order.\n\nThe place itself has a great location, is clean and really swank looking when you walk in. Service was quite friendly at the front desk, but as soon as I was given my stylist, she put her hands through my hair and made a disgusted face saying 'your hair is so dry...I am going to need to do a full conditioning treatment.\"" Upsell? Definitely... (I had just had my hair professionally done not 5 days earlier and my stylist always says I have lovely hair...curly, but never dry and certainly not scowl-inducing.)\n\nI was specific in saying what I wanted and must have said 'not frizzy' about 7 times and what did I get? A frizzy blowout...it looked nice for a bit, but did not last even the 2 hours until my event. Normally when I get a blowout, it can last for 4 days easily.\n\nExpensive, snotty and the movie they were playing made me want to gauge my own eyes out. Next time I go to Vegas, I am packing my flatiron. The only reason I am giving Dollheads 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the mimosa."
0,"Ok.. I agree, the consolidated facilities are great.  Pollution is decreased since not every rental company has to run a bus for their specific passengers.  The offsite baggage check and checkin kiosks are great to have.  So whats the beef??  Could the airport authority and/or Clark County have found a plot of land any closer to the airport??  I mean really... you board a bus to take a drive into the desert of Nevada to pick up your rental?  Upon return, allow 30 minutes to get back to the airport terminal.  One thing Las Vegas is all about is working on too many road projects and falling behind in them.  The airport area is not immuned to this policy.\n\nIt appears that facility is there to stay so my next suggestion is to have some sort of light rail (like at SFO) that will connect the airport terminal with the car rental facility.  Hopeless in asking..."
1,"The food is good, and the so is the service.  The bartenders are excellent, both in making drinks and small-talk while you hang out.  It's one of my favorite spots for lunch - alone at the bar or business meetings at the table.  \n\nPrices are reasonable and the food is tasty."
0,"The worse Bun Bo Hue. Com bo luc lac not good, rice is dried, tasteless. Not recommended."
0,"Everytime I come here they seem to have less and less men's items, specifically designer jeans, which also seem to be getting more and more expensive. \nSelling stuff is a bit different here too. It's consignment so it doesn't quite work the same as Buffalo Exchange where you bring them stuff they take what they want and give you cash or credit on the spot.\nHere, they buy on consignment so they chose the items they want and you get money based on what they sell for AFTER they sell. And they have sales ALL the time it seems.\nLast time I went I sold them 4 pieces and went in today, 3 wks later and nothing sold.\nOf course nothing they took from me was out on the floor. I literally went through every piece. Nothing.\nSeems kinda shady."
1,"Really, really yummy. Looks like a hole in the wall from the outside and limited seating but friendly service and DELICIOUS food. Homemade chips w/ 4 salsas. The beans they serve are delicious, as is the rice. Make sure to check the specials on the board behind the cash register. It can be easy to miss but usually has some yummy options. The chocolate cake is definitely for 2 people and not cheap but soooo yummy. Also good horchata.Guacamola is also not cheap but straight outta the avocado fresh and enough for 4 probably."

0,"I love going to 20/20 for the prescription as it is always right. The rest of the experience this time was less than enjoyable. Dr. McCord was stuck on selling us the progressive lenses and he wouldn't listen to me when I brought up other options. He didn't listen to my needs nor find an alternative option to the progressives.\n\nI had a chance to think about it for a few months while I did research and spoke to people who had them and I decided I didn't want them. I went back to order my glasses and spoke with Katie at the Chandler office and I explained I wanted to order the regular lenses without any progressive lenses. She didn't understand why I would't order the progressive lenses. I explained in doing my research, I found people who would be nauseous, dizzy, and it takes about a month to adjust to them for some people. I don't have a month to adjust as I need them for work. She said she wouldn't argue any of those things but she was still pushing they would be best for me.\n\nThe glasses I wanted would be $485 for the progressive where as if I just ordered what I wanted, I would be looking at $243. Big difference! Katie would not let up. She spoke down to me and acted like I was an idiot for not wanting the progressive lenses.\n\nI decided there had to be another option, so I looked at ordering my glasses online. If you go to www.ZinniOptical.com you can find glasses starting at $6.95 for nice looking frames. All you need is your prescription and you can order them online. \n\nYou can download a photo and go through several different frames from you own home and see what they would  look like on you. I should be getting my glasses in 14 days and they were only $85 with scratch coating, UA, UVB on all glasses, free anti-glare. Great selection. My husband and I were both able to get prescription glasses for $27.99. For that price, you can get more than one pair! My husband even got the magnetic sunglass lenses for his.\n\nThe most frustrating thing is to go somewhere to purchase a product or service and running into a pushy salesman/woman  telling us what we should buy because of what they get out of it. Thanks any way Katie but we decided to take our business elsewhere."
0,"Every 5-6 months I get an uncontrollable urge for a Super Star with Cheese.  Only because it was my go-to burger growing up in So Cal and I have a tiny little spot for that burger in my heart.  So, I got that urge this evening and headed on down to this Carls Jr.  I've been to this one 3-4 times over the past couple of years - and have had similar experiences each time.\n\nFirst, there were exactly 2 cars in front of me in the drive through.  And exactly two cars in the parking lot - which were probably employee cars.  12 minutes after placing my order, I finally pulled up to the window.  The car that was two in front of me had an ice cream shake handed to them and the one directly in front of me had a bag of goodies handed to them. Why it took so long, I have no idea.\n\nThe dude at the drive through needs to learn some customer service skills.  When I drove up, he looked at me and mumbled \""kldoidlp\"".  I said \""what?\""  He then said \""ketchup?\"".  No \""sorry for the wait\"".   No \""hello\"".  No repeating my order to me to make sure it was right.  Just \""ketchup?\""  I said \""ummm.... sure\"".  He told me my amount, took my card, ran it, gave it back to me, stuffed a few ketchups into the bag that he was holding in his hand and handed it to me with my receipt.  He didn't thank me.  He didn't say \""F you\"", he didn't say ANYTHING.  Simply handed me my bag.  It's usually automatic for  me to say \""thank you\"" even when purchasing something, but I stopped myself this time.  His name was Cameron (according to the receipt).  Hey Cameron, buddy.  You need some serious customer service lessons.  Ask your manager or the corporate headquarters if maybe they could get you some training.  Because you lost a customer tonight.  And judging from the total lack of activity at 6:15 PM at your restaurant, I'm going to take a leap here and guess y'all can't afford to lose too many more customers.\n\nThe burger was good by the way.  Just how I remember it.  However, not good enough to overcome the horrible service."
1,We are regulars.  Great patio.  Food is great.
1,"Having been raised on Cape Cod, I know my seafood! This place is VERY reasonable priced for seafood and the fried clams/lobster roll & clam chowder are DELISH, PERFECT. Could not get the portion size for the price on Cape Cod!! We live in the northwest area of Vegas, quite a distance from the restaurant, but we try to frequent it as often as possible ( wish they stayed open later in eve). My 2 yr old grandson LOVES the fried clams so that tells you how sweet and tender they are NOT chewy and not just the strips, it is the WHOLE clam a rare find in the desert."
1,Pricey but good
0,"I see this is a pattern at this location. I already am leery of fatburger due to the food poisoning I've received at another location. When they made our order (take out) the service was pleasant. When we got home to discover one of the burgers was wrong (three is a much higher number than 2 and therefore hard to count to) we packed it up and drove back. They told us \""They would prepare us a fresh order, but didn't want to get in trouble with their manager. Well, I WOULD return to the place, but I ate cold, soggy hamburgers that cost me over $20, for just the burgers. With this location in the hub of Five Guys and Fuddruckers, I do not feel that I should have to pay that kind of money for poor customer service AND just a burger. I can go to a full service restaurant in the area and receive CUSTOMER SERVICE, and that's even if I choose to just have take out. Luckily, since they do cook everything fresh (at least half of our order), I had plenty of time to type up this review and post it to several review pages."
0,"I dunno. I thought the bread was a little too thick and there was a little too much wet dripping out of the back end as I held the sandwich. I got the italian sub... thought it was going to be a cold sandwich, but the cheese was melted on top of the meat. Salami was a bit thin and the ham had just a little too much of that fake smoke flavor. \n\nBut Yelp is for my opinion, right?"

0,"Today was not our first day at Dillon's, but it sure was our last!  Today we went in while visiting the zoo as the kiddos were hungry.  1/2 the shark tank room and 1/2 of the outside seating is empty. There are 4 \""hostesses\"" doing absolutely nothing!  We stood there waiting forever.  People are now coming in from the main entrance and getting seated before us!  Then I was told I could go sit at the bar (not in the bar area, but at the bar)... keep in mind I have a 2 & 5 year old with me.... I don't think so!  Needless to say, we left and went elsewhere for our lunch today. \n\nFrom previous experiences at this location:\n\nCustomer service... what customer service, would have been served faster & better by trained monkeys!  To make it worse, it was a \""manager\"" who was serving us last time and what should of taken 30-45 minutes, took over 2 hours and it was the bus boy who took better care of us!  Give that kid a raise and a promotion to manager! \n\nFood.... edible, but nothing special, definately not worth the money!\n\nIf you want good BBQ, go to Charleston's at Scottsdale Road & Frank Lloyde Wright!  That is where we are going!  Now they have great service & awesome food!"

1,"Fun grungy bar with an interesting crowd. Emphasize the \""GRUNGY!\"" Despite the hard appearance of the crowd, everyone has always been pretty laid back.\n\nThe live music varies nightly but is always loud and lively, played from a crowd-level makeshift stage. \n\nThe \""Ass Juice\"" is good--just don't look at the illustration while you are drinking it. \nThe \""Bacon Martini\"" is, as stated by the bartender, \""Really good bacon soaked in really bad vodka.\"" You can judge that one for yourself."
0,Food is good but had a gift card and apparently they are location specific gift cards very stupid u offer gift cards they should be good at all your locations even if they are independently owned and operated
1,I really enjoyed the owners and family and learned a lot about them.  Their food is just what queen creek needs (real food) and nothing was bad at all.  They're right on Ocotillo and easy to pull off quick to eat.  I'm full and satisfied and ready for more.  It was my first time eating collard greens and they were very good.  The menu is a decent size and they are accommodating.
0,"Who needs crunchy, fresh popcorn when you can come here for stale, rubbery and tasteless at premium prices?\n\nI was so excited to have a movie theater arrive on my side of town.  Previously, I had a choice to go either to Arrowhead (30 minutes away on an average day) or Tolleson (30 minutes on an average day) so imagine my glee at reading about this place in the papers.\n\nSo how can a theater get two stars?\n\n1.  Aforementioned popcorn\n2.  More expensive tickets (\""because of the price of gas\"" says the manager even though Harkins is still cheaper)\n3.  More expensive snacks and drinks\n4.  Incredibly loud slide projector with 5 different slides on it\n5.  Sound lacking in quality to Harkins\n6.  Employees that seem a little lost themselves\n7.  Matinees go until 4pm unlike Harkins' 6pm\n8.  Lack of inventory (for a new theater?)\n\nEven the employees  were miffed about the fact that they were out of caramel popcorn a week past opening.\n\nI would rather drive the extra minutes to get always fresh (free with my t-shirt) popcorn and $1 (with my nifty cup) drink from Harkins.\n\nMy neighbor has gone at least twice to the theater and says she herself has had to deal with stale popcorn on both occasions.\n\nNeedless to say I really was not impressed with our theater and am one Surprise-ian still begging for a Harkins or a likeness thereof.\n\nForgive me O Harkins for any negative thoughts I harbored for you before."
1,"I really like place, the king size rooms are very nice and spacious!\n\nWe did have trouble when it came to checking in, we ended up waiting quite some time and there didn't seem to have any lines which I thought was a bit annoying because people kept \""cutting\"" in front, when I had been waiting.\n\nWe ended up getting room service, it was pretty quick and the gentleman who brought us our food was very nice and helpful. I would highly suggest paying in cash, poor guy would have to go back downstairs to use a credit card. \n\nAnother thing that I noticed is that the air conditioning does not get very cold. \n\ni did wish this place had more \""fast food\"" options or at least places that were opened later in the night.\n\nI would definitely stay here again."
0,"It was exactly as I expected. Crowded. Full of guys decked out in embroidered jeans, too much cologne, high on testosterone, and bad highlights. The generations did span the horizon, but I couldn't care less about that. If you are charging $12+ for a drink, first off, make it correctly, and secondly, don't leave it sitting in the shaker so long that it's watered down before I've even taken the first sip. My husband and had an attempted pick up by some swingers...interesting. We passed on that thrill, but deemed ourselves cool in that they picked us and our utter hotness, lol... Not that thrilling overall. I'd much rather chill next door at 25 degrees, in a big leather booth with a group of friends downing WELL MADE drinks."
1,"I had to much fun going! I'm not much of a zoo person and prefer conservation centers more because I feel like the enclosures at most zoos are too small for the animals. This place had very wide open and big enclosures for most of the animals and I really enjoyed that. I would come back again!  They have an almost pure white tiger and a white lion, those are both pretty rare cats and it was worth admission just to see these beautiful cats. Most, if not all of the animals were out to see. \nThe only few complaints I would have about this place is the soda machines are almost all out of order, there isn't a whole lot of signs around to tell you where certain exhibits are. The jaguar seemed agitated and I felt horrible for him and couldn't find any water for him anywhere and he was warm and panting. Also some of the rides were down that should've been working. \nAll in all I would come back here again, but maybe in the winter when the weather cools down. Be ready to do some walking if you go to this zoo because its huge and there's a lot to see. The aquariums were beautiful and so were the fish."
0,"This place was awful, just awful. \n\n1) Value is horrible. The prices look good but the pizza sizes are actually VERY small. A large at sano is maybe a medium at normal pizza shops at best. I usually get 2 larges for my family, 2 larges from sano did not feed everyone like usual.\n\n2) They are very skimpy on toppings (we got meat lover pizza). \n3) Very little sauce on the thin thin crust. \n4) Taste was average. \n\nOverall my whole family was very disappointed. We had to go somewhere else because our order was way too small. pizza wasn't even good. will not be returning. EVER. \n\nI can see someone eating here if they were eating alone. the sizes are just so tiny which makes it seem like a great value."
0,"Terrible experience so far with Segway of Tempe.\n\nI purchased 2 Segway tour passes at a discounted rate when a deal showed up for them on Groupon.\n\nBecause we purchased passes through Groupon, we could not use their standard \""Reservations\"" 800 number to book our tour, we had to call Segway of Tempe directly to book it.\n\nOur first attempt was before Memorial day, we found out they were doing tours on Memorial day itself (a Monday), so I called the number specified on the Groupon pass on Saturday trying to reserve a tour for us. I left 2 voicemails asking if we could get in on a Memorial day tour. Now I realize this was the weekend and they might not get to the voicemails in time to get me on a Monday tour, but I thought that I would at LEAST get the courtesy of a callback sometime the next week. Nope. No one ever called me back.\n\nFast forward to last week. The weather on Saturday was predicted to be much cooler than normal, dropping down to a high of 90. Perfect time for us to do a Segway tour before the temps are above 100 every day.\n\nSo during a weekday last week, I called and actually got someone on the phone. I then reserved a tour for Saturday at 10AM. \n\nWe show up on Saturday, at 10AM and the Segway of Tempe doors are locked and no one is there. I call their 480 number multiple times, it rings, no one answers.\n\nI then call their 800 number reservations line, speak to a representative and they even confirm that they see I've got a reservation for today at 10AM. They suggest that I call someone at a 623 number.\n\nWe call the 623 number, a woman answers and tells us that maybe the tour guide didn't show up. She says that she will call us back.\n\nSo then we see 3 Segways zipping along crossing the Mill Avenue bridge. We wave and shout to them, they see us, but they just keep driving along over the bridge.\n\nWe sit around for 15 more minutes, and the 3 Segways that we saw earlier drive up to the Segway of Tempe office where we are waiting.\n\nThe tour guide, a male, tells us that he \""didn't know\"" that we had a tour booked for today and that they don't even have 2 more Segways available for us to use today. He tells me that the female would call us back to try to \""work something out\"" with us. I give him my mobile phone number again to confirm my number with him. He then leaves with his 2 customers to continue with their Segway tour.\n\nSo at this point, we're pretty aggravated, but we take off, expecting to get a call soon offering us a tour later that day or perhaps on Sunday. \n\nNope, we NEVER received any call back whatsoever.\n\nSo on a Saturday morning, we skipped breakfast, drove 34 minutes across town only to be denied a tour that we had already reserved and then we never got a call back from Tempe of Segway at any point. Talk about terrible Customer Service..."
0,"Don't, don't, don't, I repeat DO NOT STAY HERE! \nI reserved a room with two beds and because I was a late check in (10:30PM) they double sold my room.

1,"One of my favorite places in Madison. Perfect cappuccino and some of the best, most inventive creeps I've ever had (smoked trout, roasted sungold tomatoes, sheeps milk brebis, local greens with a fried egg on top).  They use ingredients from local farms and the people working are always great.  Can't say enough about the quality of the food in this little spot."
1,"Beautiful hotel, rooms are nice, big, full kitchen, smoke free, outdoor and indoor pool, and most importantly great customer services,  staffs are super nice and friendly.  This hotel will be our home anytime we visit LV. \n\nValarie really make our stay super special and surprise, we walk in to the room  with a lovely card, champagne in ice and strawberry deep in chocolate plate, waiting for us in our room on our special day.  Thanks again Valarie!\n\nWe take away one star due to the floor show ages, stain and  dirty ( room 1401) The day we check in the floor show soil stain, dirty and sticky ( we brought flip flop with us) ....... we let the front desk know they quickly have the floor shampoo and mop.  Oh well it old and stain what can I say..... Time for new floor?"
0,"Hired these guys to replace condenser fan motor on roof top ac unit in July 2011.  The technician just happened to have the correct replacement on the truck, installed it, and ac unit worked. $400. So I use ac all summer. Next summer rolls around, and the motor is wobbling and sometimes wont run. I decide I will replace the motor myself, and I found a do it youreself supplier here in vegas called appliance parts center. The parts guys had to call the mfr, and get the exact correct part. The bad part was apparently the incorrect rpm rating, causing it to fail so soon. I learned that commercial cooling and heating had installed the wrong motor. They also should have replaced the fan blade, but did not. I learned a new condenser motor should last at least 5 years, and usualy when replaced, the fan blade should be replaced as well, to ensure a warped fan blade does not cause premature motor failure. I also learned that they had over charged me for the motor. I got the correct new motor and fan blade for a total of $230, and installed it myself. The motor was $150. commercial cooling and heating is a complete price gouging rip off operation. On top of that they dont even install the correct parts and do not care. I did a bit of research and the nevada state contractors board shows they have a history of not paying their suppliers, and home owners getting liems put on their homes.\n Might want to avoid these clowns."
1,"Why is this place empty? People come on in! I know it's on Nellis and super dupper fast street, but COME ON IN! I was skeptic of this place at first, why should I? I have never tasted Hawaiian food, plus it's fast food so even more doubt. But I went in and gave it a shot. The entrance is clean as well as the inside. I went in and had not a clue what to order. I asked the cashier, which was from the islands as well as the cook; that made me more comfortable ordering because I thought it was going to be someone else of a different ethnicity cooking the food, She recommended me a cheap and inexpensive dish to try out first. So I got that and she gave my mother and I free drinks for the wait. Which wasen't much, but ahh I can't say no...\n\n  I got a macarroni type dish with white rice and hawaiian type pork. It wasen't sweet, or to raw of taste it was real good. The rice wasen't all dry like steamed rice it felt cooked and steamed. The macarroni was great. Oh yeah the tartar sauce was great. I would come here again when I had the chance and try new dishes, I am a fan of this fast food joint. Oh yeah I think it was a low carb dish."
0,"bad company, sometimes good but mostly bad. have ask for pickup of some palm fronds from a tree trimming and they promised twice to pick up after the original trash day service missed them. they are still in the driveway."
0,"Having gone to the Studio B, Bellagio, and Rio's buffets, I would say: Spend the extra money. The ambiance is good, but the food is so-so. Not many choices in terms of meat, especially during lunch. The fruits weren't that fresh. Not one of the better buffets on the strip (the only one I can think of that's worse is Excalibur)"
0,"Small venue and the comics were not funny. The last 2 comedy clubs I've done in Vegas have been very disappointing, the other being The Improv. The best time at one of these I ever had was at The Comedy Stop at the Trop, but that one is no more. It's really a good thing my friend got us all in for free on a locals ticket. Otherwise, I would have been even more disappointed.\n\nIf you're not careful, you will spill your drinks as the only place they had for them was a cup holder on the back of the chair in front of you. This is another Vegas venue where they just make you feel like herded cattle.\n\nI have decided after this dismal display, that I will no longer be doing comedy clubs unless they have a nationally known headliner and I know I'm going to laugh so hard that I can't laugh anymore. I can get just as many good laughs from a bad comedy movie."
1,"SO Good!  Homemade AND absolutely yummy.  Affordable, generous portions. Deserts are also out of this world. Can't go wrong between this and other restaurants in this shopping center.  Best to go on weekdays to avoid crowds.  I'll be frequenting this place often!  I'm from Boston and thought this tops many of the restaurants, there. That's quite a compliment."
1,"As soon as I walked into Arrivederci in Scottsdale, I felt welcomed.\n\nThe cute, bustling Italian restaurant was cozy but elegant, with lots of chatter and linen-covered tables, and the staff at the door and servers were super-friendly. The spot is locally owned, with a second location in Ahwatukee, and my pal and I got a nice table in the corner of the restaurant to enjoy the homemade Italian food at.\n\nWe both liked how there were wine racks dividing the main dining area from the bar area, and there were pretty paintings covering the walls, while the restaurant glowed in a soft yellow light. Our server was excellent and professional, and I'd say it's a great date place if you're in the area.\n\nWe started with the Portobello Reganato con Fontina ($8.95), a mushroom topped with cheese. Our server said it was one of their most popular appetizers, and I can see why: it was plenty of food for two people to split and had a ton of cheese. The mushroom was really juicy and brought a healthier aspect to the dish, and I really enjoyed it.\n\nOur meals came with freshly baked bread, and I ordered Ravioli Caprese Gratinati ($14.95). It was a pretty traditional cheese ravioli, and nothing really stood out to me about the dish, though my companion really liked the fresh tomato sauce it was smothered in. The pasta was thick but a great consistency-there wasn't anything wrong with it, but I've just had more memorable meals.\n\nMy guest got the Vitello Madeira con Porcini ($18.95), which was veal covered in a mushroom wine sauce and served with pasta. He said he would have preferred a cream sauce instead, which is totally available to you, but he really liked the veal.\n\nFor dessert, we had the epic chocolate tiramisu the spot offered. It was a giant slab of my favorite dessert, and it tasted pretty heavenly. Definitely get it if you go here-I could have eaten the whole thing myself!\n\nMy favorite part about dining at Arrivederci was definitely the atmosphere and the service. I love places that make you feel at home, and Arrivederci certainly does that with zero pretentiousness from the staff, and I also appreciated the casual elegance vibe the place had. Not to mention, I'm still dreaming of that dessert."
0,"As we went fleeing from Hi-Scores, we ran into one of my co-workers, who had finally gotten there after mass traffic on the 215. Well, we didn't want her to feel bad, and I wanted to hang out with her some, so we tried the next door \""property\"" to Hi-Scores, The Player's Club.\n\nIf Hi-Scores is the unnecessary sequel to Insert Coin(s), The Player's Club is the very unnecessary sequel to that. It is the \""Adventures of Lolo 3\"" of the barcades.\n\nWe were told The Player's Club was meant to be a more lounge-y, suave version of Hi-Scores, and when we walked in, it did have a very man-cave feel with cushy chairs.\n\nBut unfortunately, the problem was it was too much like Hi-Scores. The menu was exactly the same. The game area was even SMALLER, with a few foosball tables and pinball machines.\n\nThe kicker was when I ordered a Red Bull & Vodka. I swear this is what went down.\n\nME: I'll have a Red Bull & Vodka.\nSHE: Is there a certain type of vodka you want?\nME: [pleased by this] Sure, can I get Skyy?\nSHE: Okay, we'll get that started.\n[Few minutes]\nSHE: We don't have Red Bull. We have Monster though.\nME: Oh. That's fine.\n[Few more minutes]\nSHE: Um, we don't have Skyy. Would you like Grey Goose, Belvedere...\nME: Really? Uh, Grey Goose, I guess.\n\nSo my Red Bull & Skyy has turned into a Monster & Grey Goose. Fine, whatever, par for the course for the night. A few more minutes pass, and (I'm still not kidding) the dingy server brings me a shot of Grey Goose and half a lowball of Monster, no ice.\n\nI hate you. I hate you. I hate you. HOW DO YOU SCREW UP A RED BULL & VODKA???\n\nI actually had to go up to the bartender and ASK for a glass of ice. I took it back to the table, threw the shot over it, then poured the Monster on top. And when they billed me, I was billed a $7 vodka shot with a $2 Monster \""bump.\""\n\nIf they thought they had any shot of me coming back, that got \""bumped\"" right off the table."
0,So my friend's thought it would be cool becuz they like playing video games & drinking. So they thought it was ok. It wasn't my cup of tea. \n\nPlace was crowded with what looks like underage teens with fake id's & much elderly people =x  The drinks was pricey but what bar isn't. \n\nMost people just standing around and looking awkward or sitting and just chatting. The dance floor is in the back area everyone just standing in a circle no one dancing. The table gaming area was only two people playing videos.\n\nIt's not like you can pick people up or mac on them while they're playing a video game. There is no pause button and you don't want someone interrupting u while ur playing a good game. It's just weird. \n\nThe play is an nice idea and something different but it was boring for me. I rather go over to a friend's place or stay at home to play videos and drink. So much more fun and comfortable.
0,"This place says it closes at 11pm and its 1020.... And they denied us service! :( \n\nWas actually really excited for this, sadly place is still run by unprofessional people."
0,So far crap! Can't check-in until 4 unless we want a full bed. Then tried to check-in at 4 and told all they had was a handicapped accessible room with a double bed. Said needed to wait another 40 minutes. Smells like smoke in the empty lobby where they are supposedly full! Do not book via Priceline!
0,"We went to this place to try out their happy hour and the small plate menu. I had been there the weekend before with a friend and had ordered simple food. Now I thought we would try something a little more ambitious. The simple order was a california roll and the Korean pork tacos. The tacos were a bit greasy, but that was expected. \n\nOn this second trip, we ordered a shrimp tempura roll and chicken yakisoba. It was a weekend evening and the place was empty but it was late for dinner. The shrimp tempura roll was rubbery and the yakisoba had over cooked noodles, bad tasting chicken and a gloppy sauce that came right out of a jar. We called over the server and asked and he just said thats how they make it. \n\nThe soy sauce, their own recipe, tasted rancid. We spoke to the manager and he just acted like I should be honored to eat at Pearl Sushi and they were in Chandler doing us a favor. \n\nWe eat out a lot and we won't be returning to this place."
1,"One of my new favorites! The food is great; we've been there twice and service was awesome both times. Prices are also very reasonable, especially given the quality of the food.\n\nI had the miso ramen, my husband loved his oxtail curry. We also had a mango tuna roll (?) which was delish - the fish was really fresh. A bit too much garlic on the chili garlic edamame, but that was good as well.\n\nThe restaurant is a lot larger than it looks from the outside and is really nice inside. It looks like they have a private room. \n\nWould definitely recommend!"
1,"Great food and atmosphere! Steaks were cooked perfectly and they were delicious! Lobster bisque and the lobster pasta were wonderfully delicious! More than enough food, we left there stuffed and happy! Definitely will come back :)"
1,"Have been here twice. If you want a custom hot donut, this is THE spot. Many flavored of icing, tons of toppings, and the combinations are endless. Just be prepared to spend about $2 per donut. The price is a bit high, but worth it as an occasional treat."
0,"Oh my god .What happened to this place..We used to love coming here. Went last night and I have to say, it was absolutely horrific. So sad now because it used to be a place we looked forward to going. Needless to say we won't ever go back, it was that bad. I will say the service was great but food quality was not even on the chart. $200 for the 4 of us and didn't think twice about it because again we always enjoyed it. I would be surprised if its open a year from now. We hope there will be another seafood buffet that will again be one we can look forward to going to. Charge $75 a person and make it quality and they will come. We will."
1,"If you like humongous portions amazing food, eat here. The CF Steak, CF Chicken, and (especially) CF Pork are amazing! The Prime Rib and Ribeye are also fantastic."
1,"Great hospital the nurses were the best.  Our daughter was born here recently and we have no complaints.  I do wish the Mongolian BBQ that is offered in the cafeteria was better though.  It was prepared with the thinnest single slice of lunch meat chicken and then after a few bites I found it so unappetizing that I just threw it away.  But you don't go to a hospital for the food, and that's why I rate it five stars."
0,"Am I the only one who was totally disappointed with this place? I am a HUGE frozen yogurt fan. I've been driving out to Yogurtland in Scottsdale for my fro yo, but was excited about the new place (Zen Zen) opening up down the street. Tried it out tonight. All I can say is YUCK. I guess I was spoiled with my Yogurtland. Zen Zen was clean, yes. But, the selection was nothing like what was advertised on the website. When I finally did decide on just plain chocolate and vanilla, I was even more disappointed to find the frozen yogurt runny; not a consistency I'm used. It was way overpriced, too. I usually pack my cup at Yogurtland and rarely break $5. I spent $6 tonight on just over half of a bowl. Needless to say, I'll be making the drive out to Yogurtland in the future. :("
1,"I didn't stay here but I did cover some serious ground here....\n\nWhat I love about the Venetian is that there are so many places to sit. I know that sounds weird, but MANY of the large strip casinos don't have nice couches and chairs all over to just CHILL in - yes they all have lounges and bars with chairs but sometimes I want to rest with NOTHING in front of me. \n\nThe bathrooms are very nice. There is a Guggenheim Museum inside with GREAT exhibitions. Fat men in red and black outfits pretend to know Italian and sing. LOTS of shopping."
0,"First, this place is filthy dirty, I shouldn't have let them touch my nails based on that alone. From there it gets worse. I went in for a gel manicure. The guy doing my nails made me bleed pretty badly while cutting my cuticle and then proceeded to paint the gel right into the blood. So my manicure didn't look very nice to say the least and that also is very unsanitary! Then he overcharged me. A regular manicure is $12, they charged me $35 for a gel manicure, completely ridiculous price. I definitely won't ever go back and I suggest you avoid this place as well."
1,"It's a small area, but big, beautiful sights to be seen. \n\nIt changes so there is high replay value and between this and the Fountains you can spend a few hours doing something FREE and satisfying.\n\n For those into photography, this makes for great practice area. For those who just love taking family photos, this is a great photo op. I will say though that during the day it can get rather crowded so sometimes it'll be a wait before you can get your turn and have a clear shot, but most people are considerate enough to hold walking through if they see you are trying to capture a photo. You get a lot of nice natural sunlight through the glass ceiling, but if you don't mind night shots, it sometimes is very quiet depending on the setup. To me, the Chinese Year Year ones always look great at night whereas the spring one is best daytime. \n\nIf you want to see all of the seasonal gardens, this is the schedule: \n\n2013 Exhibit Calendar\nChinese New Year | Jan 12 - Mar 3\nSpring Celebration | Mar 9 - May 11\nSummer Garden Party | May 19 - Sep 8\nAutumn Harvest | Sep 14 - Nov 30\nWinter Holiday | Dec 6 - Jan 5, 2014\n\nBetween 5-6pm there are live musical performances from the Victorian Gazebo as well. If you're a flora nerd, apparently they do a Q&A with  Mr. & Ms. Green Thumb between 10:30am-11:30am. I would be interested to ask questions, but that is hella early for me! \n\nI'm always excited to see what they come up with. Sometimes animals and people are involved in the exhibit. My favorite was a rustic country springtime one with a a greenhouse full of butterflies.  If you notice the gaps in the dates. I came once while they were transitioning and it was partially closed off/unfinished areas.\n\nTourist and locals come here and spend a day in Vegas finery without blowing a lot of cash! I come for the fountain show, the gardens and get a treat at Jean Philippe and realize half the day as gone by.\n\n(Yelp 100 Challenge 37/100)"
0,"Maybe I'm just too old for this place but as a 30 year old, I felt like an outsider.  Everyone there seemed to be between 18-22, which to me, seems strange at a bar in downtown Phoenix.  I would have expected feeling that way on Mill Ave! Not that I go to Mill Ave ;) but seriously.  I was with a group of people ranging from 26 to 35 and we all felt extremely old and out of place.  It's a young, hipster place where there's only one beer on draft (it was some vanilla Hefeweizen.... I never heard of Hefeweizen with vanilla and I think there's a very good reason) and nothing good in bottles either (budweiser, miller high life, PBR, schlitz, etc).  How couldn't I find even a Bud Lite or Miller Light?!?!? We stayed for about 10 minutes before calling it a night."
1,Great Pizza! I was in Champaign for business and this place was recommended to me. It is well worth the money for amazing deep dish pizza!
0,Tried only few things. It's very hard not to make good italian sausage sandwich.... The same goes for calamari and salad\nHighly overrated
0,"Do not eat here!! I felt something hard and sharp in my fish tacos and luckily I spit it out.  It was a hard, sharp, plastic bread tie.  I could have slit my esophagus.  Although our waiter was apologetic, the owner could have cared less!"
1,"Alright, I am bumping Sens up to a four star.  I tried the Mint Shrimp and was floored.  Uh-Mazing!!!  The serving is small, two pieces, so order two.  The Fried Wontons did not disappoint once again.  I tried an unfiltered sake.  This was great as well.  Our server was attentive and fast.  I can see them going to a 5 star with another visit or two."
0,"Well after a few months since my previous review I did return and things have not changed one bit. The silver age, war and horror (old school subjects, from the 60s/70s) drawers are still empty. I collect silver age, but I don't have a specific item that I am looking for, I basically browse the drawers and if a cover appeals to me I buy it. To me not having a structure in my collecting makes it more fun, I don't need to complete a full run and any random book or subject is just fine with me. The cover art is what I am mostly looking for (since 90% of the time the story in the book lets you down in relation to the exciting cover art). I really liked it when they had several drawers full of silver age that I could concentrate on and they were located in one place towards the beginning of the line of drawers. Now you can find silver age, but they are mixed into all the other hundreds of subjects and those drawers are so full you can't even look through them without removing a huge stack so you can take a look. Some drawers are so tight, you can't even remove some to make room, other drawers are packed so loose that the books are falling over damaging other books and folding them.\nI did manage to find a few items that totalled about $15, but when I checked out, again no mention of the rewards program. Again this is a sticking point with me, since for all the years I was buying there it was at about the $250 in total purchases that I was finally offered a card for the rewards program. Ugh!"
0,"I've been here a couple times, and the food is alright. Nothing special about it, but I might be biased since I usually have homemade Filipino food.\n\nWe ordered beef calderetta, pork adobo, grilled bangus, and halo halo for dessert. The beef calderetta was actually pretty good. I think I'd have to say it was my favorite dish of the night. It kind of tasted sweet, not typical of any calderetta I've ever had but I'm not complaining. The pork adobo was also a little sweeter than any adobo I'm used to. As for the grilled bangus, it was...really bland. And the halo halo didn't even have buko in it! While the food was okay, it didn't taste authentically Filipino to me.\n\nThe service was hit or miss. There would be times where the waiters and waitresses would always check up on us, followed by periods of neglect. Also, the waiting time for the food was really long, considering it wasn't that busy.\n\nOverall, this was place alright. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but I wouldn't throw a fit if someone was going to take me here."
0,I used to love this place and go all the time. But I had just walked in and the staff there was very rude. I'm pretty sure they're seasonal or something because they didn't even seemed like they worked there. They're closing in less than 20 minutes and the girls are literally sitting on the counter. It's such a shame because this is a really awesome place to get shoes.
1,"Shhhhhh!  Don't tell my friends but one of the hottest guys in the show was gay.  I didn't realize this until he realized I was gay and offered me his lap to sit on for the picture.  There's nothing really telling about the moment.  It was just a feeling.\n\nAs I sat on his muscular legs, I was like \""umm...this Jaymes Vaughan fellow is such a sweetie pie.\""  Then it hit me, he's most likely a southern gay.\n\nHe was a great emcee, full of charisma, warmth, and humor.  Not that a straight guy can't be those things.  But...yeah.\n\nAnd he was hot, way hotter than his pictures--which captures his body beautifully but not his face.  That's a good thing.  Why wouldn't you want the performers to be better looking live for a live show.\n\nPleasant surprise.\n\nAnd at the end of the show, he gave me a shout-out for being the only guy in the audience and said I would totally get laid that night by one of my three female companions.  Awkward heteronormative moment but not in the annoying way.  My friends got a chuckle because they knew better.\n\nI thought this show was going to be so cheesy and homophobic but it's quite gay-friendly.  Audience friendly in general.\n\nNothing trashy.  \n\nVery suggestive.  \n\nAnd lots of great naked butts.\n\nReally great.  \n\nExpect women to go crazy.\n\nReally crazy.\n\nIf Chippendales is something you're thinking of going to see, you really just should!  Put this expected Vegas experience on your list and cross it off.  I didn't necessarily find all the performers hot, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nDoesn't matter if the dancers are straight or gay, it's fantasy.  I've always been a fan of thinking.\n\nThanks Kristin for hooking us Yelpers up with a deal for the Yelp Spring Break."
0,"Our waitress was horrible - she seemed incredibly overwhelmed by even the smallest request, and would disappear for large periods of time. And then there was the food, which I would call \""mediocre at best\"". My fish tacos consisted of a tortilla, breaded fish (that had unquestionably been frozen 30 minutes earlier and slightly resembled a fish sticks), shredded lettuce (that came straight from a bag). We also ordered the mac and cheese and the Pittsburgh bites. Given that all of these items were also premade, I am not sure how it took 45 minutes to get our food. My best guess is that our waitress forgot to submit our order.\n\nThe only points of redemption were the good drink specials and the Honeybee cocktail (which was not on special but was absolutely delicious)."
0,"I didn't even get to try their food because the server was so awful to us.\n\nFirstly, our table still had bits of food left on it. The two of us sat down and got our menus. After 15 minutes of tracking down someone, a girl that was not our original server finally cleaned our table and took our orders. She was nice, you could tell she was just a bit flustered because she was doing everything. The girl that sat us down, however, had made eye contact with us several times, smirked and just whispered to her co-worker. Otherwise, the only real work she did was slowly walk around in a circle. \n\nI was so confused. Looking back, I wish I had asked for the manager. Having worked in food service before, I honestly believe that good and honest customer service is key for the best experience. We waited for around 40 more minutes then hungrily realized our food was probably never going to come. We left a toonie for the one drink that made it to our table. We never even got water. The SO said that they hated students, because he came here with his father before and the service was decent then. I was so shocked and angry. I will never come back.\n\nThe prices were a little up there, but we heard the quality of the fish was great so we decided to give it a try. At least the Sprite was good."
0,"Employees are nice, but prices are double any other Starbucks that I've ever been to. The also don't have a Starbucks card scanner. If you're going to charge crazy prices at least have good technology. Last time I get Starbucks at Aria.\n\n*after coming back the next day it appears they double charged me, but I'll never know since they didn't give me a receipt."
1,"All you can drink house wines are really good! The menu is short and simple, but taste's great. The atmosphere is what really makes this place pop, and I love the little old guy with the accordion! It's a local fav, and easy to find. Parking is limited, so walk from the Flamingo."
0,"I could have hurt myself because a customer of Beta pushed me off said platform. Then security escorted me out of the premise under the reasoning of being unsafe.\n\nThe security personnel were being verbally abusive and borderline physically abusive almost reaching full blown assault!\n\nA bouncer had to be restrained as he was close to getting physical with a customer!\n\nI would like to receive an explanation of why your security team refused to allow me to speak to a manager on duty, who were unreasonable to listen to an explanation from me and proceeded to escorted me from the building."
0,"As an Arizona native I was excited to try the Phoenix location on central; as I had already tried the Mesa location and was a bit underwhelmed. I was hoping that the Phoenix location would impress me and live up to the rumors I had heard.  The server was fast and reasonable polite, and after ordering two combo platters (beef burro and chicken burror) the food was out in under ten minutes.  This was surprising, as I expected a longer wait do to the self proclamation of all food made to order.  Unfortunately, this was the last pleasant experience here.  \n      I would like to claim that the food was just ok, but in truth it was pretty awful. The chicken was dry and had a slightly rotten taste to it as if it been sitting around for a few days.  the beans were undercooked, crunchy in fact.  The rice was okay but it seems very dry and tasteless, even after dumping half of the salsa on top of it.  My father's beef burro faired none better as he referred to it as \""mushed up cat food\"". \n      As an active man of large stature (6'4 240lbs), it is rare for me to leave a meal unfinished, but in this instance, I found myself abandoning the plate and retreating hungry and unhappy.  If this was a bargain priced restaurant I would be more understanding, but for 12 dollars I expect more than boiled chicken, undercooked beans, and tasteless rice.  Oh, and they unknowingly charge you $1 per small chip bowl which you find on your bill when you pay....for shame!  Save your time and visit one of the many glorious Mexican restaurants in the area, just not here.  But if you do, worry not on seeing me as I shall never return!"

At first, I has a hard time trying to pin point what it tasted like then it dawned on me it tasted like noodles from chicken noodle soup!

0,"Amazing how things change!!\nSo the many times I have been to Vegas in the last 4-5 years The Four Queens WAS the place. Now for get it. We have just arrived back from what was the worse experience in all my traveling life.\nWe went down as usual this time was for my wife's birthday and to celebrate our 19 years together. I wanted to surprise my wife with a bottle of bubbly in the room with some strawberries for when we arrived. I made the request via email a week before leaving.\nNow you would expect if there were any problems for the hotel to contact you well in advance of your arrival. While on the road internet access is not great, however we turn up at the Four Queens and check in, we go to the room where there was nothing.\nOf course my wife didn't know so I made an excuse to pop down to front desk. I spoke with the NEW front desk manager. Who made some BS excuse about why they couldn't do it. \nTo add insult I still wanted to do this so it was there when we got back from dinner, and the front desk manager was all over the place and I ended up waiting around in the lobby for over 45 minutes, how the bloody hell am I suppose to make up a great story to my wife who is now waiting in the room for me?\n\nSo after I explained it was to be a SUPRISE!!!! I left.\n\nThat evening at 11pm the room phone rings and it was room service talking to my wife asking if we wanted the bottle of bubbly delivered now!\ncompletely ruined the surprise but I made sure it didn't ruin the trip.\n\nAfter discussing and coming clean to my wife she was understanding and we both decided to stay in Vegas longer but NOT at this place. So we check out and walked over to Fremont Hotel and Casino and stayed there.\n\nThe Four Queens will never again get my time or money."
1,"The BLT Bloody Mary is a must have.  The food is great.  You get a lot for your money, and worth the wait."
0,"I know this place used to be the be place back in the day but it just keeps slipping more and more into slum status. Fortune or mis fortune, however you would like to look at it, I am in Vegas every other week or so. I have stayed off and on at the Riviera for years and witnessed first hand its descent into the dregs. \nHere I am today, not my first choice for sure but it came up with a good rate so I thought, why not, let's see how the Riviera is doing. Ugh!!!!  It is Tuesday, I stood in line to check in/check out, stood there for nearly 20 minutes. They had two desk clerks and b periodically someone would step from behind and help someone.  I get to the desk and it is 12:00, I'm told that in addition to having to pay for my room and the \""resort fee\"", I have to pay an early check in fee of $20.00. Seriously? 20 . 00 so she tells me I have to wait until 4:00 to check in without the fee. She also tells me I don't have to wait in line, I can check in myself at a Kiosk after 4:00. I note that all of the kiosks currently say, \""not in service, use next kiosk\"". I have a meeting in roughly a half an hour, there is no one at the bell desk and a long line there too so I drag all of my luggage back out to the car vowing to NEVER stay at the Riviera again and to NEVER book any events there or even refer it to anyone ever. Would have been nice to clean up a little and change out of my shorts and t shirt in a hotel room rather than a bathroom since I have a meeting.\nWhen you read the negative reviews here and elsewhere, believe them. If I could give them less than a star I would."
1,"\""The original sports bar and restaurant\""? If by \""original\"" you mean old, this sports bar fits the bill. Located in a nondescript part of town off the strip, we weren't sure until we actually walked through the door whether this spot was actually still in business. Once we entered, we were confronted with a rather uncomely and smoky bar area; taking our chances, we proceeded to walk through a narrow passageway that opened into a back seating area with tables and booths. Very quiet. Strange layout, I must say.\n\nBeer is cheap (e.g. Shiner Bock for $2.50). We happened to come in during a game, so pizzas were half off. However, we wanted to try the famous STROMBOLI, so we ordered a small original one to share ($8.49). It was pretty good! I was expecting something dry and tasteless, but the dough was soft, crisp, and perfectly baked. CHICKEN WINGS ($3.55) were cheap and decent.\n\nOverall, having had low expectations for this dive bar, we were quite satisfied. There was an elderly couple across the room who ordered a large pizza (remember, it was 50% off). I think they only ate one piece between the two of them and packed up the rest to go. Smart idea if you don't want to cook dinner! The booth behind us consisted of a middle aged woman and her elderly mother: they enthusiastically ordered a TABLE FULL of dishes as if they were a gang of college jocks. I just saw the waitress bring them dish after dish. I think it was the mother's birthday or something. Or maybe just the daughter's annual visit. In any case, as we left, satisfied with our snack, we were somehow cheered and warmed by the memory of two grown women pigging out on some good ol' comfort food."
1,I've never been but the line looks huge. Five stars! Also once I saw someone get knocked outside five stars

1,"The only reason why Brad T. & I decided to go here because we have received a coupon/deal for $50 off % 2 complimentary desserts.  We called ahead for a reservation on a Monday or Tuesday night & it was a busy night due to a convention that was in town. \n\nFOOD (4.2 out of 5)\nAppetizers:\nCalamari: Good, I wouldnt bother ordering it again,\n\nEntree:\nMine: I ordered the seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster tail.  I always get my steaks medium rare and this tenderloin was absolutely perfect.  The taste was very juicy and succulent.  The lobster tail did not have much flavor to it, but it still tasted good but not as amazing as the tenderloin.  I savored the taste of the tenderloin ohhh how lovely it tasted. \n\nHis: Filet mignon w. crab meat: I took a bite of his filet mignon and from I remembered it was a bit overcooked but thats (Brad T.'s story to tell), I loved the taste of the crab meat though! MMMMmmm\n\nDesserts: (Since it was complimentary) \nI was astonished how huge the desserts were!  \nCoconut Creme Pie:  I personally did not like it very much,  I felt like it was too creamy for me.  I had a few bites here and there and the taste is good but I couldnt handle eating more of it.\n\nChocolate hazelnut cake: Loving chocolate, I enjoyed the cake alot. It wasn't very sweet at all & of course I had to take it home.  I couldnt finish it all.\n\n\nSERVICE (4 out of 5) \nThe hostesses were very professional.  \nOur server was sweet.  She was okay in the beginning but she got better as the night went on.  We normally dont require much attention as long as our water is refilled we are pretty much set for the rest of the night.  \n\nATMOSPHERE (3.8 out of 5) \nIt was a busy night full of commotion and talks and laughter filled the room.  I enjoyed it.  I like the paintings/portraits on the wall and they had a locker for wine which was pretty cool. \n\nOVERALL (4 out of 5)\nI liked it here, but it wont be my first choice that I would go to if I wanted to eat out."
0,"Bachelor Party Weekend!\n\nSo we dropped the big $$ and got a 2 bedroom suite! The suite itself was freaking amazing. Definitely 5 star worthy. It had a tub, huge projector screen, super modern feeling and really nice.\n\nThen why the 1 star? The service here absolutely sucked. For example:\n\n1. Asked the cleaning staff to clean the room. Came back, and.... they made one bed. No new towels.\n\n2. Called for some towels. Was put on wait for 15 minutes...\n\n3. Called concierge to ask a question. Put on wait for 15 minutes, transferred to the wrong people. Transfered again to the wrong people. Gave up.\n\n4. Called asking if we could get some toiletries. Was told no. Person hung up.\n\n5. We wanted to book a Cabana. Apparently that's impossible unless you physically go out to the pool, hunt down one of the Cabana workers. Great...\n\nJust in general, the place looks amazing until you want some help from the staff. Then you might as well bend over and kiss your rear.\n\nNow normally that's not a 1 star, but the thing is this is Vegas. Going to any 4 star + hotels you will never have this crappy of service."
1,"See?  I said I'd come back!\n\nMy friends and I were in Vegas at the end of June, and we hung out at The Chandelier both before and after dinner at Holstein's.  We got comfortable in those big white chairs, and took pictures (obligatory) with the giant chandelier crystal strands.\n\nThis time, we had a round of drinks, and they were delicious.  The menu tilted light and fruity, perfect for drinkers who don't actually like the taste of alcohol.  I like my booze to taste like booze, but the cocktails were pretty great.  The group favorite was the strongest anyway, the Spiced Apple Jack made with Laird's spiced applejack, yuzu sour, apple juice, rosemary-infused simple syrup, and a balsamic reduction.  This was a stellar drink, well balanced and full of fun flavors that blended well together.  I think half of our group ordered this one.  We also sampled the Misty Rose and The Butterfly cocktails, and these were good, too.  Misty Rose happens to be the name of the color of my bridesmaids' dresses (apparently very popular at J. Crew), so this was a fitting drink, with the right peachy pink color.  It came with Hendrick's gin, St. Germain, and rose syrup, and it was light and went down easy.  The Butterfly featured Hangar One Mandarin Blossom, Aperol, mango and strawberry pure\u00e9, and yuzu sour.  Similar idea - fruity, pleasant, the booze so disguised a child could drink it on accident.\n\nWe didn't stay the whole night, but we filled most of our down time hanging out in this lounge.  I like The Cosmopolitan, but since it's home to some of the more popular clubs and restaurants on The Strip, it would be almost unmanageably difficult to visit without The Chandelier to make the wait times easy.  I expect I'll be back any time I'm in this hotel, and now I know my drink of choice."
1,"I tried them when they first opened and know. food quality has improved alot !! before food was bland and took long for delivery however I have been impressed enough last couple of orders to write this review. MUST ! singapore noodles ! with or with shrimp, general tso, hot and sour - could use a little more vinegar to my taste thats me, overall food has improved will be going back for more singapore noodles !"
1,Such a beautiful newest addition to the strip. It's a chic new boutique hotel. It's so beautiful inside! I will definitely be staying here at my next visit!
0,"Poor Shawn J.! Should've read his review before going to this place. \n\nI believe this is the same place that sells to the Venetian (at least to their food court). I've had cupcakes at the Venetian and they were okay. So maybe this place had a bad day? \n\nThe place is cute. The cupcakes are adorable globs of sweet. They over-frost, as everyone says, but then the sprinkle it with either raw sugar, choco chips, or sprinkles and then there's another decoration on top of that, such as a flower, or a cookie. Very cute! \n\nNow, I'm not a cupcake connoisseur. You'd never think so from reading my reviews, but I love to buy cupcakes, I don't like to eat them. Does that make any sense? So, in my case, Gigi's is the perfect store for me, because the cupcakes LOOK gorgeous but they taste awful. \n\nCan you imagine putting plaster in your mouth? Then can you imagine adding a ton of sugar to that plaster? That pretty much sums up the flavor of ALL the cupcakes. It didn't matter if it was Citrus Green Tea (ha, don't make me laugh) or Blackberry surprise, it all tasted the same, gummy and over-sweet. There is no other flavor, but the colors of the cupcake are different. Maybe that's why they have different names, it's to describe the color of their cupcakes? \n\nThe only one that tasted barely ok and had any flavor was the oreo cookie, I did get hints of cookie and cream flavor. \n\nThe cakes were really stale and dry. Yuck. \n\nThe lady working was really generous. She gave me three free cupcakes for buying two. Too bad I didn't eat any of them. But I can't fault her, it was good customer service."
0,"One of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant in my life! Everything started off OK. The live music was pretty cool but it was really loud and hard to talk over. Things started to go downhill when the waitress brought a wrong dish, never brought the right dish, forgot a glass of wine, and then brought us our check with extra things on it that we didn't order. We asked her to fix it and if she could split the check up. She came back in almost tears saying she couldn't do it and asked if we could just figure it out because she couldn't remember what everyone ordered. We then called the manager over who was not very apologetic or sincere and he asked us, \""Well, what do you want me to take care of?\"" Your not supposed to ask, your just supposed to do it DUH! So we didn't pick anything out for him to take off, we didn't mind paying, we just wanted to pay for the right things! Then he came back after running our cards and he had charged my friend's card more than he was supposed to. We showed him this and he later came back and threw the check down and said, \""I just took care of all of it\"". He then stormed off, not apologizing once. Worst managerial service I have ever come in counter with and the whole process took more than an hour after we had finished eating!"
0,"Can somebody please give me a tongue scraper??? Quick! The taste (or lack thereof) of the crappy $9 bloody mary is piercing my tongue! One of the things that irks me the most, is when you go to a restaurant, spend ten dollars on a \""signature\"" cocktail and it tastes like garbage. \n\nIn this case it tasted like water tomato juice, with a sprinkle of pepper. And a massive celery stick that engulfed the glass. \n\nSo you say, you should drink beer when you go to these places. You're right! But then don't put crappy drinks on the menu, just to fill up space. \n\nAll in all, we are in Scottsdale after all...there are a million places to go that have more to offer.. \n\n\nI left after the drink. You got me at \""hello?\"" No, not so much."
0,"I've always tried to stay away from coffee chains especially the ones oversea (they're an Australian corporation), but wife needed coffee and it was conveniently located close to the Apple store. \n\nWe ordered a small cup of coffee and a double shot of espresso. I really should have just walked out when I asked for a light roast but was told that they only have dark roast and a light roast is dark roast with added water. Obviously the person working knows nothing about coffee. So I took a sip of their dark roast and just as expected it was bitter nastiness. \n\nThen wife got her espresso and it was basically burnt black liquid. No crema, big coffee grinds at the bottom of the cup. \n\nNeedless to say we will never return. We'll stick with local cafes that actually care about and have respect for their industry and their customers."
0,I will never go back to this Rite Aid! I had a problem with a very expensive product there and the staff was very rude to me. The assistant manager spoke down to me and treated me like I was stupid. She did nothing to help me or the situation. It was so bad I left in tears and will never go back.
1,"I've gotta say, growing up in Buffalo, I never thought I'd say that a *chain* would do chicken wings right. But these guys come mighty close. They're not an authentic Buffalo wing, but they're clearly not attempting an authentic wing. What they are attempting is simply a damn good wing. And they seem to pull it off (in the few flavors I tried).\n\nMy only real gripe is that the place (at least the Forbes location) really felt like a chain - in the sense that it was too big, too empty, and not really a pleasant place to eat. There are some chains that somehow still pull off a comfortable, cozy place to eat - but unfortunately, this wasn't one of them. (I suspect they gave up that coziness to make way for a sheer number of tables - but when I was there, 80% of those tables were unused.) A shame, because the wings are good. That said, they're worth grabbing to go or eating quickly."
1,"For me this place is out in the middle of nowhere, but if you are anywhere within the 20 mile radius-you must go! \n\nToday I tried the take-out building for lunch/ 1 and the service was great! Very nice and knowledgeable about the menu.  BTW there are plenty of tables to eat in at.\nI had the new salmon tacos with their mango salsa (that I crave regularly) and with a little green salsa to even out the sweetness they were perfect and plentiful.  The salmon had a tiny bit of crunch on the edge and the rest was perfectly moist.\n\nUsually I can resist eating all the corn tortillas...not here! Too darn good. \n\nFor $10 I got 2 huge fish tacos & an even bigger soda. Great value!"
1,Forgot how good the food is here..Damn they need one in Yuma!!!
0,"This review is if you come here during the day. We parked at a nearby lot and the first hour was free so since this place is pretty boring, we were in and out within that hour. I remember coming here when I was younger and I saw the light show and thought it was cool. I came here during the day and this is a tourist trap. It has no legit restaurants and the casinos are ghetto and not strip status. You will also notice that the crowd tends to be different than what you see on the strip. This is more for chill hill billy type folks and the pace is a lot slower here. You will see tourist shops and street performers but nothing you havent seen before. This is a drive from the strip so if you have a car, go ahead and come here. If you dont, it is not worth the taxi money. I will not be returning and I just wish I had seen the light on the ceiling.\n\n**TIPS**\n1) Do not come here during the day. It is quite boring with nothing to do. Go at night when you can see the light ceiling."
1,"a little confusing at times to get around but overall not too bad! Make sure to walk past the main food court to find a little more options. That being said, it is still airport prices A.K.A 9 dollar sandwhich"
0,"Ok so I finally dined here and lets say disappointing wasn't even the word...if I'm going to be dropping a large sum of money down I want it to be on food that I actually enjoyed!\n\n I went a few weeks ago and we opted for the three course Chef's Tasting menu...well lets just say if these dishes were a reflection of any chef well they truly shouldn't be one right down to the presentations!!\n\n For my first course i had the \""Baked Beans\"" as we called it not at all what I expected to get and  barely any Duck Confit in it as it said on the menu very boring and missing lots of flavors so yes they tasted and looked like Baked Beans. Then second course I had the Tomato with goat cheese and peas I had one bite and did not go back for another. The plate was filled with tomato liquid and the goat cheese was running right in it  YUCK is all I have to say!! Then finally our last course MY favorite is Rack of Lamb so of course I'm now anticipating my Lamb I had asked for it to be cooked Rare/Medium Rare just in case they were to over cook it. WELL sure enough it came out Medium Well...Now i would have sent it back but my friend had ordered his steak Medium Well and got his Rare so i didnt want to be that table that sent everything back....\n\nOnly good thing about this place was my company. it is outdated they may want to rethink they're concept AGAIN and possibly add a few woman servers in there to bring some life to this place!! Finally this place was stale like the bread!!"
0,"Went to Saddle Ranch with friends for the first time a month or so ago... That visit was fun. Server was pleasant, we got our food & drinks quickly, everything was great for the price. Something huge must have happened between then and yesterday. Place was a wasteland, but we had to wait for a table. Took forever to get our first round of drinks because the \""bar was backed up\"" with the dozen other people in the building (they did apologize for that, and comped our next round, that was nice). Food was cooked wrong, the menu included items they don't even have, and we kinda wanted another round when the server brought our bill out. Then the bill was all jumbled up. My food was on one tab, my drinks on another. Plastic drinking cups were cracked and dirty. The girls want to give it another try, but I'm pretty sure I'm done with Saddle Ranch."
1,"Tana has been a blessing in my life. I have been seeing her for over 4 years off and on now. When ever I need her, she is there to give me positive support and a lifetime of wisdom I can use to get me through the rough times. I appreciate her and definitely recommend choosing Tana as your Life Coach :) No doubt"
1,"Had a leaky water softener.  Called them about 9am on Friday September 12, 2014.  The man said they were very busy that day, but would try to get someone over there as if possible.  He told me the leak was bad and seemed concerned about it getting worse.\nIt was after 4pm and I figured they weren't coming that day.  I thought they would hopefully be able to make it the next day.  But, to my surprise, I got a call from Carl with Reidhead Plumbing and he said he was on the way.  I thought after 4pm, no plumber is going to start a job.  Well, he did.  And he finished it quickly.  Took out the old water softener and installed a new water softener that we had purchased.\nReidhead Plumbing exceeded expectations by showing up when I expected to have to wait another day.  They did the job quickly and well. I write this five days later - no leaks or problems with the new water softener.  And, at a price that was less than the other two quotes I received."
1,"A newly opened establishment that has creating buzz around town for its fresh and healthy meals. There is a breakfast menu, served all day in addition to their entrees items for lunch and dinner.\n\nYou would have to use your phone to map this place out because it is on Dean Martin Drive in a business building plaza, not your typical location for a restaurant.\n\nThere are a lot of menu options, it is hard to pick just one to try for your first time. I ordered the Chix on Broadway, a breaded chicken sandwich with bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, and lemon aioli. Your side options include truffle fries, sweet potato fries, or healthier options of fruit, brown rice, and salad. I chose the truffle fries, and they are delicious. I could taste every ingredient in the sandwich, including the lemon aioli that was subtle yet added to the flavor. Chix on Broadway was made well and all the ingredients complemented each other.\n\nFor a somewhat fast food restaurant, the wait was 15 minutes for my food to cook. This is only because it's cooked to order from fresh ingredients, making it worth the wait.\n\nI was genuinely pleased with my  first visit, I would come back to try something else new on the menu at this creative American restaurant."
1,"Toujours un bon choix pour le lunch, m\u00eame pour le soir ou le 5@7.\n\nLa bavette de veau est vraiment tr\u00e8s bonne. Le service super attentionn\u00e9, l'ambiance assez dynamique, peut-\u00eatre un peu bruyant, mais l'exp\u00e9rience est tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able et positive. Choix de vin correct peut-\u00eatre un peu limit\u00e9 au verre, mais raisonnable.\n\nJ'aime beaucoup cet endroit."
1,"This place doesn't skimp.  You order juice and you get juice.  Not watered down.  Not iced down.  Pure, straight up, juice.  The prices are a value for what you get.  Great place for an after workout drink."
0,"A group of us went, and from around the table, it seemed folks enjoyed their food but wasn't necessarily impressed.  Pricey too.  My chopped liver (I know, am I like seventy? I try anything once) reminded me of sweet cat food and the bagel chips were so hard I gave up for fear of my teeth.  Sweet potato fries, ok that rocked.\n\ni was excited about the bakery section though.  The counter guy was great, patient with me while I basically bought a sampling of everything.  The choc babka was unmemorable and extremly crumb-y (what a mess cutting it), but add insult to injury, I go to Luci's Marketplace the next day and find the same babka there for 35% less than what I paid at Chompie's."
1,"The Huntington Press is known for publishing books about Las Vegas.  They have a very large number of books about gambling, but they also publish books by local authors about Las Vegas, its history, and its quirks.  \n\nThe company is probably best known for it publication of the Las Vegas Advisor, a monthly publication--available in paper form or online version.  A companion book that comes with the subscription is called the Pocket Book of Values, a book filled with coupons for deals in Las Vegas.\n\nI get the POV each year, and while I don't use even 1/2 of the coupons, using only a couple more than pays for the book and gets you access to their online site.  It's a good value."
0,"Well lets see...first I wanna say I totally agree with the reviews this place already received. I usually survey restaurants too, and didn't see a single mexican person which threw me off. I mean the place does not need to be littered with a particular race but if the food is authentic and good then usually mexicans will frequent the place. (Same goes with Asians,Blacks etc.) Well I was brought here by a friend who seems to love the place..The waiter was polite..and the soda was flat. I ordered the green chicken enchiladas and they tasted so sweet..I mean I prefer spicy mexican food..not sweet mexican food. It totally killed the night for me..because it seemed like he was excited for me to like the food..He had such rave reviews for this place. Apparently a must if your in Vegas.\n\nMy friend ordered the albondigas soup which didn't look like the kind my ex mother in law made. It looked like the can stuff honestly. But other than that the chips and salsa didn't look good either. The music was annoying and I didn't get a chance to look at the check or I'm sure I'd b*tch about the prices too. Where's a King Taco when you need one?"
1,Like their fried chicken! highly recommend! and they deliver.. Yum! especially if you are pregnant.
0,"First off,it is extremely difficult looking for this place as its in the back of the hospital and there is no sign at all saying that the pediatrics is located there... which is annoying. My daughter is a new patient with them and the first time I called to schedule a appointment the lady was rude and always interrupted when I spoke,there was a day where I couldn't make it in and I called to see if I could schedule a later appt,and the receptionist said abruptly that I couldn't because the doctor was leaving and there are no open spots today and I needed to take my daughter in right at that very moment... another day I came in the doctor we asked to be my daughters doctor and I even know what she looks like wasn't even our doctor,she didn't even tell us her name,she didn't even physically check on my daughter and I had to do all the work,not to mention this day I came in to check up on my daughter's burn marks... She didn't say much and didn't really do anything.. I'm very hesitant to even tske my daughter back here.. as of now I just called to schedule another appt,also not even to mention AGAIN the previous time we were there they didn't even let us know when to come back again,so as of now I called in to schedule another check up.... they open at 8? Yeah I'm pretty sure!  Ring Ring no answer,call again..ring ring no answer.. called 4 times and no answer. No they were not busy it rang for a long time, I'm not site if they're busy or ignoring calls. But I'm giving them one more chance and if it it blows bye bye arrowhead pediatrics."
0,Me and my wife sat down on a slow Tuesday night. Very cool place. Sad part when was I wanted to order I asked the server can you tell me about the menu? The culture? Your favorites?  She didn't have a clue of what was going on! We left! Doh management please give your staff the tools they need to exceed the guests expectations.
1,"We stayed at the Golden Nugget on Fremont Street (loved the whole Fremont  Street area too). One of the best places we discovered was The Griffin. A dark, hip, friendly and very popular lounge at the end of The Fremont Street Experience - they serve up some cheap drinks and plenty of chill atmosphere. \n\nI highly recommend this as a late-night downtown destination. We will make a point of coming back here each time we return to Vegas."
0,"Went to Baby Kay's on a Friday evening. There was a 30 minute wait.\n\nWe ordered some hushpuppies for an appetizer. My wife ordered a 1/2 Oyster po-boy and gumbo and I orders the shrimp basket.\n\nThe hushpuppies came out with a horseradish sauce and ketchup. The hushpuppies were ok, kind of like Long John Silver's hushpuiies. The horseradish sause was excellent though.\n\nThe service this night was not very good. We waited almost 1 1/2 hours to get our entrees. The server steered clear of us most of the night, which made us angrier. If she would have communicated and offered a salad or something to tide us over, we would have understood.\n\nWe finally get our food and it is average at best. My wife's po-boy and gumbo were cold. My shrimp basket had 8 measly shrimp on it. We were really hoping for better, especially after the wait.\n\nAfter our experience, we don't know how this place gets such good reviews.. food and service not good."
0,"This place is absolutely terrible. Finally got around to canceling my monthly, and when I did they just said \""sure, we'll take you off the list.\"" They weren't curious at all as to why I would want to cancel. To me not caring is a lack of customer service.\n\nThey close at 5 supposedly, but I arrived at 4:55 and they were already all closed up. This is the second time they've closed early on me. The reason I was there in the first place was because I had just gotten my car washed there the day before and they did such an awful job that I came back to have it fixed. Whatever they sprayed on the dash splashed onto my windshield and left a spray of stickiness that smudged. The rear view was also not wiped. The sunroof was cloudy. I asked them what time they closed and a guy told me 5. It wasn't 5 yet.. But he said once they've closed the wash that's it.\n\nHold on now- my schedule is currently stupid cramped and for me to take the 30min to get my car washed is kind of a big deal. To have to go back to have it fixed is even worse. To go back (driving ACROSS town from where my next appointment was) only for them to be closing early is unacceptable. They didn't make my schedule, that's fine. But they did make theirs and the least they could do it stick to it.\n\nThis kid sees that I'm obviously pissed off, and he hands me his towel to wipe my windshield down myself. Umm.. That's definitely not why I pay a monthly price for service here. Jesus Christ. I almost lost it.\n\nSo I go back AGAIN (three times now for one wash) the next day when they're open.. I came before 4pm just in case they decided to close early again. While I'm waiting for my car to be finished one of their employees  is flirting with one of the customers. The customer pulls out some\nweed for him to smell and they act like they're being sneaky. You're not. I can smell\nit from my seat across the way. This is one of the most unprofessional businesses I've had the misfortune to deal with. I've cancelled my membership- good riddance."
0,"So I saw the Martinez taco bar in the middle of a nice little shopping center and I thought why not let's give it a try, I enjoy new things. It was rush hour for dinner time and the place was empty so I was a little skeptical to begin with. The clerk who came up to the register to take my order looked as though he had just done some crystal meth in the back which isn't unusual for small Vegas restaurants. I decided to order the $9 carne asada burrito with french fries to go . I thought ok any $9 burrito must be fantastic and boy was I wrong. When I got home and open this beast up I could see the grease pouring out of the tortilla. When I bit into the burrito the slices of avocados were raw and harder than the onions and I had to spit them out. The carne asada was chewy and overcooked without any authentic flavor. I didn't even finish half the burrito . I love authentic Mexican food but this place is a dump and lacks any concerns about quality, my advice is stay away. I feel the gut churning already. Blahhhh"
1,We love their Breakfast buffet.  It's as good as it gets for the price! We visited the Feast Buffet for our first Easter Brunch in Vegas.  Delicious!  It was only $20 for the holiday price. We used to pay alot more for alot less in Arizona on Easter.  \n\nTheir seating process on the busy holiday was so much better than usual.  The line went very fast and were seated as soon as we paid. \n\nI would recommend this to anyone!
1,Went their had a great time food was great bartenders where nice . Just don't sit by the taps kept getting sprayed by the glass rinser kind of a bummer
0,"The Brown Ale was delicious, can't remember the name, but the alcohol is def. the best part about the place. But frankly put, this place was way overhyped. I went here for an office get-together and we ordered just about every appetizer and shared plates. Nothing stood out to me that would separate it from any other steak and fish place in the area."
1,"I adore this place! The food is always fresh, the cocktail & wine selection is amazing, the decor is romantic yet playful and the service is always on par. The happy hour is one of my favorite in Old Town. A must try!!!"
1,"I love how they open up the windows when it gets warm enough and have a beer garden up top.  They have good daily drink specials (Sharkbowls on Tuesdays!) and is kept very clean - and I don't just mean by campus bar standards!  During the day, it's also nice to sit by the open windows and grab some chow - just your typical bar food - but it can get pretty busy, especially for lunch.\n\nI remember getting a Sharkbowl for the first time on a barcrawl with co-workers: \""Uh oh, these are really yummy\"" =P  Needless to say, the fact that Firehaus was only the second stop on our list made sure that the rest of the night was comprised of a bunch of drunken debauchery."
1,Would have been five stars if the service had been better. For a Saturday night pretty empty so was surprised to see it take a while to get service. Food was fantastic as usual!
0,"After doing some shopping nearby, I was lured into ATS by their slogan: \""Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\"".  When ordering at the counter, the staff seemed very disinterested in helping customers.  When I finally did order my carne asada burrito, I was given a number and asked to take a seat.  While I waited, I noticed a few other customers wondering what was going on with the bad service at the counter.  When my carne asada arrived at the table, I was starving.  However, the burrito that sat in front of me was tiny.  I'm not really one to complain about small portion sizes, as I feel that most portions are too big, but this portion was just comical.  The burrito was served with a lime wedge that was dry and looked like it had been sliced the day before.  The flavor of the carne asada was bland, as was the texture.\n\nOverall, this was a pretty disappointing meal.   \""Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\"" is a really misleading phrase to have on their sign.  This place is not even close."
0,"Jos. A Banks is a high end men's formal wear store.  Since it's high end, steep prices are expected.  What's not expected is how bland the store's collection of clothing is.  \n\nMen's formal wear shops are fairly generic, with the cut of the cloth and the quality of the material used in the clothing determining the price.  As a result, I judge these stores based on the ties they carry.  A high-priced suit can come from many places, but the quality of the store hinges on the ties in my opinion.\n\nAnd that's where Jos. A Banks fails.  Conservative suits do not require a flat or dull tie in order to maintain their formal nature.  On a dark suit or gray suit, a tie can make the outfit, bringing style to what is designed to look like a cookie cutter outfit in business.  But the collection of ties at Jos. A. Banks is awful.  The colors are drab, the designs on the tie are the same as the ones in the early 1980s and the prices are ridiculous.  \n\nFor a suit, it's a decent place, but stay away from the ties."
1,"A great place to eat. I had the pork BBQ plate. Nicely but not overly smoked taste. The fried squash may be the best in Charlotte, NC! I didn't care for the potato salad. It was too eggy and too much mayonnaise for my taste. My family had the Ribs and said they are really good also!\nThe service wasn't the greatest but wasn't to the level of bad. More along the lines of they hadn't scheduled enough people that night. It is a \""sports bar\"" environment so it's very loud."
1,My Home away from home :)\nI love this gym. been a member for over a year now. Its so clean & the staff are wonderful. If you are really into working out and take it seriously then this is the perfecttttt gym for you. Its worth every penny. it has everything you could possibly want in a gym and more!! :) i have NOTHING negative to say!
0,"Back in 2007, my car (BMW 540i sport) was involved in a minor accident and one of the front rims was damaged (18\"" M Parallel). The bodyshop (whom I had a working relationship with as I am a former auto dealer) outsourced finding a replacement to Wheel Specialists. Wheel Specialists sent the body shop a replica M Parallel. The rim was obviously a replica as the lip was slightly different, the color was slightly different, and the rim lacked the OEM BMW markings. Getting an OEM rim was very important as the OEM rims were forged and the replica was not. I told the bodyshop I would handle the mix up. I went to wheel specialists directly to handle the situation and I dealt with Brad. He was a gigantic asshole. He refused to admit the rim was a replica. He basically told me I didn't know what I was talking about (even though I specialized for years in BMW's). Even when I pointed out obvious differences (lack of a part #, differences in appearance, etc), he wouldn't budge. The attitude I got from him was \""leave me alone, go away, and let me get back to buying underage girls vodka-tonics in Scottsdale with my d-bag friends.\"" Needless to say, I eventually gave up. I recently went back to wheel specialists to look at some Vossen rims. They gave me a competitive quote, but I used a different shop because of my previous experience with them. Had something gone wrong, I doubted they would have fixed it."
0,"Dr Eichenlaub's office was to put through several referrals for specialists following my 1/3/12 appointment with him.   Two weeks later, referrals had not been submitted. I made another app w/dr Eichenlaub for 1/17  to  follow up on the same referrals that evidently had not ever been submitted. At this second appointment  I was assured the referrals would be submitted.  Waited again, referrals never submitted per my insurance company. After several calls to follow up on the referrals, the nurse finally told me she missed the referrals because the doctor had not noted them on the super bill and that only one referral had been submitted. She said she would refer it to her supervisor Carrie.  Carrie never returned my call, so  I escalated my issue to COO Larry Preston,  Mr. Preston returned my call and was less than helpful. During the conversation I asked if I could interrupt him to give him one  more important detail and he said \""no you cannot. I listened to you, now you can listen to me.\"" (I wanted him to know that the nurse had told me the referrals had not been put through). He continued on at some length to tell me that HPN was at fault here. That they could not control HPN's response to requests for referrals, that there many rules and protocols to follow, etc., etc. When he finished, I shared this additional information with him that I had been told the referrals had never been submitted. He responded that referrals had been put in, but would not tell me which ones. He again stated they could only do so much,  HPN processing was at fault.  I told him I needed to get to the bottom of who it was that had failed me on obtaining the medical care I needed. His response was that he basically did not want to rehash the issue again and he would not tell me which referrals had been submitted.  I reminded him that I had been told that only one referral had been submitted, the others had been overlooked by his staff.   I told him I felt is response was not adequate; his response was that \""I should take some medical classes and he would be happy to refer me to some online classes.\""  We ended the conversation there, however I did ask for copies of my medical records and asked if the submission of referrals would be noted there. He told me no.  Of course he told me no, because they had never been submitted.\n\nBottom line, if the COO, Larry Preston, of this company is so unresponsive and unwilling to work to resolve an issue, but rather blames another party, in this case the insurance company, you can expect the rest of the staff that he manages respond the same way......which they did. Very poor medical care and very poor customer service. I will be filing a complaint with the Nevada Board of Medicine and of course changing doctors.\n\nWould NOT recommend this medical group."
0,This place used to be the go to spot. Real Solid for the most part. Now the food is horribly bland and the egg rolls have some spice in them that is super nasty.\n\nSad
1,"Great deals after the holidays! It's not everyday that you can go to a J. Crew outlet. You can probably find the same items online but going to an outlet gets you the additional discount. I found good deals on the shirts, ties, and pocket squares! I'm pretty sure most of the good stuff were gone but I was able to find classic items like the navy gingham pattern shirts and pocket square to match with. It was a nice deal!"
1,good deals great chicken
1,"My wife and I love Tapas and this is one of our favorite places for Tapas in Vegas.\n\nWe've eaten there a couple times and the food and service has always been good. \n\nA great place for a larger group, it's fun to order a selection of Tapas to share & pass. Be sure to also leave room to try the Paella, which is very tasty. Also, they have a variety of Sangria's worth trying.\n\nConsidering this is Vegas, I was pleasantly surprised how reasonably priced everything was. \n\nEven though this place is in a Mall, it doesn't feel like it. If you can, get seated outdoors. It's a great view of The Strip right across from The Wynn and fun place to people watch."
0,"What a shame...so much promise.\n\nWas our last day of our honeymoon and we headed down a couple of hours before we had to leave for the airport - in search of a lovely last experience of 3 weeks spent touring California and nevada. \n\nAll started well. Great choice of craft beers, the chicken wings rocked as a starter but then came the main. \n\nI realised too late that I hadn't been asked how I wanted my burger cooked and unfortunately then got the dish I expected. \n\nOver cooked, well done, dry, lacking depth of flavour. I LOVE my burgers and had hunted out the best on our trip. This was sadly the worst we had. Also it seemed strange that the burger listed along the lines of the ultimate bowl burger came without cheese or bacon for which you had to pay extra on the $16 or so price tag. If it's the deluxe venue burger pimp it up guys!\n\nTo top matters off my wife's chicken burger was made from chicken mince and not breast. She had one bite, said it was cold and didn't touch anymore. With such a cool venue, rock ethos, friendly staff and great beer menu we expected food to match - maybe a bad day in the kitchen but it sadly reminded us of cheap chain pub food in the uk - not fresh, lacking care and definitely a sad end to our beer and food tour that had so many highlights."
0,"We had been to Milo's at the old location and had some very good meals there. I loved the hummingbird cake. The food was special.  Something must have happened when Milo's moved to its new location. We decided the year it moved to go for Thanksgiving dinner, which was our first time there. We had the worst holiday meal experience of our lives. Our reservation was not honored in a timely way. The kitchen was over an hour behind. A waitress told us the owner had been letting in people without reservations, trying to capture all the business possible. Since we had nowhere else to go, we stayed. The food was really underwhelming, just above cafeteria grade, from the turkey to the dessert -- which was too bad, since it was a set, limited option menu, which should have given the kitchen enough focus to do things well. Our family was very let down by the experience. We have never gone back."
1,"A hidden gem, they have a little appetizer bar full of spicy items e.g tripe, pig ears, tofu, etc it's delicious too! I'll be coming back for more"
1,"Friends and I just had lunch there today for the first time.  We were wowed!  The Food was fabulous, we had Cobb Salad, a Prime Rib Sandwich and a Philly Steak Sandwich.  The fries were perfect too.  The Jacima salad was delish and different.  What an adorable place - we all just loved it.  The gardens and the layout and the rooms, the museum, all of it was way cool!  Can't wait to go back.  A real gem in Casa Grande!"
0,"I'm really troubled about this review!  My darling and I decided to give it a go in lieu of \""The Thirsty Lion\"" as I had not been there before.\n\nThe place was not real busy and we sat at the bar in order to watcha bit of NFL action and were immediately greeted by our bar tender/waiter staff and he was great.  Really great !\n\nWe ordered a couple of adult beverages and started to review their menu which is extensive to say the least. They also have a separate shushi menu and you know I'm checking that out. So we ended up trying a couple of shushi rolls and ordered a couple more drinks.  The rolls came along pretty quick and folks, they were off the hook good.  I was surprised.\n\nWe order one more roll and one entree and again, the food quality was great, and the service was fast and friendly.\n\nThen the kiss of death jumped up a bit this place in the arse ....\n\nI excused myself to use the restroom and upon entering, thought I had stepped back in time.....  And not a good time.  The restroom was filthy and not just dirty but that \""Oh my God\"" kinda of filthy!\n\nWe finished and the check with a tip was very fair and reasonable so what am I supposed to say?\n\nI like the place ....  The food was great as was the service ..... The cost factor was good ........... But I have to wonder what the kitchen looks like if a public area is that dirty??\n\nI will give it one more try to try and be fair and determine if this was a fluke but as of today, this is \""strike one\"""
1,This place is my own personal beauty and wellness heaven!! The staff is the sweetest and make me feel so comfortable! Hailey the office manager always takes great care of me and always does what she can to work with my schedule especially if I need a quick drop in visit! The doctor is so kind and makes me feel so comfortable at all times! Just can't say enough about this place I love it!!
0,"Printing is good quality, and it should be for the amount you pay. DO NOT deal with Adam. He's an ass and knows nothing about customer service; very smug and confrontational and does not listen to the clients needs. After several bad reviews from friends I have stopped recommending this place to friends and have found several other services with the same quality for cheaper."
0,"This review is for both food and service.\nWe first ordered a bottle of red Napa valley Chardonnay wine....which was very nice, affordable and made in America....all for 80$ a bottle.  We were happy.\nNext, we had pan seared foie gras...which was exceptional !   We also had the three cheeses and charcuterie ...which was really nice, a big plate of mouth watering flavors...the only flaw was the wild boar prosciutto, which had a wild stench...our main entree was duck ...once again exceptional ...and Chilean sea bass....one taste, and I had to spit it out...it had a strong ammonia taste which indicated that the fish was not fresh!  The waiter quickly took it away, and we substituted it for the salmon, which was great.   The waiter said someone would come by to talk to us about the Chilean sea bass.  Our dessert consisted of grand marnier souffl\u00e9 and pecan pie souffl\u00e9...the grand marnier was great, but the pecan pie was ok.   One spoon and we realized that we needed tea to go with the souffl\u00e9 .   We had organic green tea, and earl grey.  Upon asking for the bill which with tip came out to be 400$.   The reasons for the 1 star are:\n\n1. We never received an explanation or an apology about the ammonia smelling Chilean sea bass from the chef or the manager.  We had to ask the waiter, and he too was surprised but could not do anything about it.\n2. After the main course, our waiters should have offered tea or coffee to go with our dessert.  We had to requested ourselves.\n\nFor a 1 Michelin star restaurant, this is very sad."
0,"(looking around the room)\n\nTesting, Testing, 1, 2, 3?\n\nOk. We all know how much I love a good sandwich. Nay, a great sandwich. And since a sandwich is God's invention meant JUST for me (and every other good boy and girl), it should be perfection.\n\nLadies and germs, I present Subway (or as I like to call it WrongWay). We've all had those moments in our lives where we go through phases (paisley shirts, the Beatles, and Ace of Base (still in it)), and Subway's $5 footlongs are no exception to that.\n\nToday, I popped in to this location out of desperation because I didn't want the other option (KFC Double Down). My sandwich at this location was loose, limp and stale. And no one likes that combo. I had the Italian BMT.\n\nThe ingredients were fine (except the brownish/green tomatoes). But the sandwich as a whole, was unappetizing, and didn't have the fresh, crispness that I've come to expect from Capriotti's, Jimmy John's or hell, even Quiznos. \n\nDo yourself a favor. If you are in need of a stellar sandwich, and nothing is in sight, PLEASE go to the Walmart Neighborhood Market and pickup your own ingredients. Your own sandwich will taste better.\n\nAlso, if you are in this complex, pop in to Cheyenne Dental. They'll do a great job for you. Review on them in the coming weeks.\n\n(faints on stage from weak sandwich)"
0,"We were so looking forward to this. Grabbed a Groupon and headed to Rio. Got there at 9:30. The girl said. 45 minutes. No problem. A few seconds later a party of 27 walk in. That pushes us back to two hours. No problem. They text me and we head to the entrance. A short mouthy bouncer grabs my bag while still on my shoulder and searches it. I pulled it back from him angry. He asked what I had in there. OK. If you are going to check bags, check everyone's bag. We go to the 51st floor, the outdoor club. It's packed. There were probably 20 others waiting. People are frustrated with their tickets out. She let's 2 other parties with later time stamps ahead of us. The party behind us notice she is letting them go first and get angry. Finally it's out turn. The ride was fun, but the staff was so rude I will not return."
1,"My girlfriend and I went here as part of our date 2 weeks ago. Heard a few things about the place and read the reviews so I thought we would check it out. Based on the area of Scottsdale it was in. I was expecting a club/restaurant looking place with people all sitting at a bar eating alcoholic ice cream being douches and pretending like they've known about this place from the very beginning. But I was pleasantly surprised to see next to all the fancy expensive restaurants, a small little ice cream shop that you wouldn't think would serve alcoholic ice cream. Made me think they could be smuggling fire arms and drug trafficking as well and who would know cause the place seems so innocent (calm down ATF and Sheriff Joe. just making a joke). The lady who runs the place is real nice and was informative right off the bat when she saw us. I got the Tiramisu/brandy and I can't remember what my girl got but it was just as good. The lady seemed very appreciative of our business which was nice to see considering im sure she's doing great business and could be a ass if she wanted. Im sure the next time im on that side of town I will make the trip over there. The only thing I wish is that the scoops were a bit more. But im just being greedy. The amount they give you is a good portion if you go there after dinner for dessert. For both my girl and i spent about $8 for the 2 of us. And I also like the little piece of waffle cone that comes with it. Its better than a huge waffle bowl that is tough to break."
1,"I eat here twice a month because it os close to work, but it's worth the drive from any where. It is one of the best BBQ joints I've eaten at. Staff are friendly and the service is good. I need to eat here sometime when I'm not working so I can enjoy a bevie. It's has a fun decor that is probably enhanced with alcohol. ;-)"
0,"I want to like Fate but I just don't. They cater to my vegan cravings so how bad can it be? But I just get a really shitty vibe when I walk in... Like it's sooo annoying that I want to eat there. This could all be in my head. I think everyone should try it for themselves. \n\nThat said, what's not in my head is the pricing structure of their drinks next door. Holy mother of chicken, Christmas and rice. Those are some pricey fuckin' drinks. The ambiance is cool but it doesn't justify it. Not to this wretched skank's soul."
1,"First Rugby Game! I loved the atmosphere from all the scottish fans cheering up there team! the stadium is also very nice, we had nice seats, overlooking the whole field. Hope to see more games here next year!"
1,"Choosing a pet sitter on Rover.com is not like traditional dog boarding. It is more like leaving your dog with a friend with pet insurance and dog expertise!  There are plenty of sitters available.  You can pick and choose who best suits you, like small dog households or large dog families, children or cats in the home, fenced yard or apartment, etc.  Every sitter I've used has been excellent and treated my dog as family. Drop off, pick up times are negotiable. Best part? You pay thru the website, so no awkward money exchanges (Rover.com holds the payment until services are rendered).  So glad I found this option for pet care!"
0,"Well, this is the 2nd time my fiance and I have been here. I must say, I'm disappointed.  We came during AZ Spring Restaurant week, so the menu was limited- we had the filet, the short ribs, cesar salad, tortilla soup, chocolate tarte, and berry tarte, ALL were excellently tasty! What I didn't like is their problem with gratuity. The first time we went here, they tagged on a 20% gratuity to the bill for no apparent reason- \""meh, maybe its their policy\"". So, this time the restaurant week menu specifies that gratuity  will be added to the ticket- but the older folks next to us (mind you, the tables are VERY close together) ordered the EXACT same thing and their ticket was $15 less than ours. Disappointing- especially since the pregnant waitress in flip-flops took care of almost the entire dining room and paid very little attention to us. So, we're a bit disappointed by this discrepancy, and won't be returning. Too bad, the chocolate tarte was delish."
0,"I'm sure I've been eating that this place since before birth.  I was born an raised in Glendale.  \n\nThe hostess that sat us took us to a table that still had plates, and cups from the last customers. We had to point it out to her if she was going to clear the table.  I had the Red Menudo, and my guest had the Carne Asada burrito. The order took 1 hour 20 minutes to get to us.  Burrito was cold to the touch, and other food matter on the plate that I'm thinking was not garnish. I asked that it be redone fresh, which it was. I waited to eat because my guest was w/o her order.  When food was brought back out, I was asked if I wanted mine reheated at which said no. My Red Menudo was orange in color, and the broth/caldo had no taste to it at all. This was a waist of 2 hours of my Sunday.  I have always look the other way when it came to La Perla Caf\u00e9, but I'm so done.  I will find another place to take my family after Mass."
1,"This place is amazing! I was a little hesitant to try it but it was so yummy. I will definitely come back and bring the rest of my family.  \nEverything tastes fresh and homemade. The seasoning is perfect, not over powering, and gives it amazing flavor. The presentation is very detailed and it makes the plate look extra yummy. \nThe staff is really sweet, and the chef is very talented. Our waiter was great and very attentive. The decor is fabulous, so much to look at and gives it a home feeling. I would recommend this little cute cafe to anyone!\nOh and this is my first review ever, I use yelp a lot but never really felt the urge to write a review until tonight!"
1,Nice place to hangout with gf :)
1,"Went back again....this time for their famous blueberry pecan french toast. It was just like bread pudding...light, fluffy and extremely delicious. I was only able to get through about 1/2 of it. The kids chowed down on their usual cinnamon crunch french toast. We also had a lovely chat with the manager, Steve Bell. Super cool guy and was great with my kids (my daughter loved him). He was very helpful when I asked him questions about their gluten free options (my mom suffers from Celiac disease). We will be back very soon...this time with mom/grammy in tow. Thanks again Steve :)"
1,"This is one of my favorite joints in town.\n\nWhat started off as a \""Where's Waldo\"" type of eating establishment, has quickly become the staple of anyone's Cosmo visit. Nestled in a secret hallway on the third floor, this pizza joint features a vintage arcade cabinet and pinball machine, flatscreen tv usually playing Sportscenter and oh yeah, delicious freakin' pizza!\n\nI have only frequented this place as a late night, drunken jaunt when I'm stricken by hunger pains and the buzz has started to wear off. However, this place can serve as a great lunch/dinner option as well.\n\nThe pizza is flat and delicious, the beer is from the tap and the decor is vintage. What isn't to love?!"
1,"mmmmmm still very good.  Medium (8\"" sub) meatball sub... Cooked perfectly... Meatballs are MUCH higher quality than Subway or Quizno's!\n\nThey also have Coke products!! YAY Diet Crack erm... I mean Diet Coke!!"
0,"Closed due to \""family emergency\"". I would have forgiven the fact that I drove a half hour to check you guys out but now I read in your reviews that other people say you are doing this on a regular basis? Not cool! I ended up going to KFC instead and had a horrible experience there. I just gave them a 1 star review too & they earned it but I'm not about to let you off the hook either because if you honored what you said I would have never been in that situation. I would've much rather eaten here (I think). I will update this if I decide to give your restaurant another shot. I wanted to try and see if Om was as good as people have been saying. However, I'm starting to feel like it's a sign to not waste my time since Om obviously doesn't care about our business if they're not honoring their posted hours. Who wants to drive all the way over and find out they are closed? Very unprofessional... especially for a fairly new restaurant trying to establish their clientele.\n\nMy advice to all... Call first before you make a special trip out."
0,"This place is crowded with a long wait to get seated.  This would be ok if the food was worthwhile.  It isn't.  The food is bland and generally poorly prepared.  The number of choices isn't that great and worst of all everything I had was lukewarm at best.  The only reason I gave 2 stars is because we had an attentive server.  \n\nHere's a couple of examples.  The crab legs are served cold unless you carry them yourself to the fish bar to have them steamed.  Guaranteed to make them watery and tasteless!  I think the drawn butter is the stuff you put on movie theater popcorn.  There was some sausage that was cooked to a nice medium rare.  Sorry, I didn't find out how that tasted.  I like Israeli style couscous (the big kind).  It really should be cooked so it isn't like a Grape Nut though.  \n\nThey do have some good bread and the $10 Stella Artois was tasty.\n\nGo here only if you want to pay $35+ a head for basically Golden Corral level food.  I'm honestly flabbergasted with the people who gave it good reviews."
0,"Good location,average food, but too expensive. Drink service is slow. Entertainment is spotty. Should double the bar size and delete dining room. this place has been steadily going down hill. surprised they are still in business. was very good 20 yrs ago. Owners watch people like hawks, desperately waiting for food orders"
0,"He is so funny on TV but in person it wasn't very good at all.  Most of what he did was old material, and he had this strange inside joke going with the band.  It was as if he really didn't care whether the audience laughed or not.  I'm out $80....live and learn"
0,"I was so excited to take my boyfriend to Cartwrights after I had a wonderful dinner with my mother several months ago. After sitting down I noticed right away they completely changed their menu. No longer can you pick your steak sauce and sides, and you are bound by set selections. Not only did they change their main menu, but the chocolate cake I was so excited to get as dessert has now been changed to a gluten free VEGAN cake! Vegan cake?! Who the heck comes to a steakhouse to order a vegan dessert? Come on Cartwrights why did you change something that was so wonderful? Needless to say I was disappointed in the menu change, and we headed to Mastro's for dessert to have a real chocolate cake."
1,"You know what this place deserves a great review from me. Yeah, yeah I know what you're thinking \""Jamie it's just a Red Lobster\"". It is a Red Lobster and I am a regular customer here because my dad loves this place and honestly I don't have anything bad to say about them. Their service has always been spectacular; all of their wait staff have been nothing but fun and friendly to my very dysfunctional family. I've had many items on the menu and have enjoyed everything. Not to mention, they have a great bar. Where else can I get a double sized frozen margarita with my seafood meal? This place handles large parties gracefully and easily splits checks when needed. This Red Lobster has served me and my family well for years. I love the different \""fest\"" seasons too, Lobster Fest being my favorite!"
1,"This place is amazing. By far the best food and drinks I've ever had. And it's in Charlotte! And so close to my house. The food here is seriously like sex in your mouth. Everything is delicious. This night I got to taste a friends lobster soup and I swear I wanted to jump in the bowl and live in it. I haven't had anything here is didn't like. Example cold meat plate. I would never order that but it's amazing. And of course the lamb skewers are incredible. Better than a filet. Truffle fries, well yes please! This place need to never close down. \n\nAnd don't get discouraged by your long wait. It's totally worth it. In fact order as much as you can with a friend or many friends and share. Taste as much as you can. I haven't had the brunch but that's hopefully going to be my next visit."
1,"Fogo De Chao is a Brazilian Steakhouse, AKA an All-You-Can-Eat Delicious Meat dinner.  They also have the option of just doing the salad bar if you are not a meat eater.\n\nThe sides and salad bar have tons of fresh veggies, imported/gourmet cheeses, cured meats, and various Brazilian style side dishes.  Let's just say there are a ton of great options to start with so definitely start by grabbing a plate here.  \n\nThey have these cards on the table with one side green (go-feed me more) and the other side red (stop-I'm full or need a break).  Flip your card over to green and the chefs start to serve you fresh cuts of meat that are brought to your table and sliced right onto your plate.  Choose from chicken (even bacon wrapped chicken!), beef (at least 3 different kinds), pork, sausage links, and they even have lamb.  When you are satisfied then flip your card back to red.  \n\nI'm always so full that I don't have room for desert but one of these days I'm gonna try the Molten Chocolate Cake!  The table next to us ordered it and I was literally drooling.\n\nI'm getting hungry just writing this review. . . ."
1,"SanTan Brewery in downtown Chandler is a great place to enjoy fantastic beer at low prices. Opened in 2007 and located in historic downtown Chandler, SanTan occupies a former bank building where some artifacts were left intact. Stacks of safety deposit boxes have been re-purposed into seating and the old vault remains as an office for the pub.\n\nThe open space is relaxed and comfortable, though with many hard surfaces it tends be on the noisy side. For a quieter experience, opt for one of the many seats on the patio, where there can be great people watching.\n\nSummer heat requires ice-cold beer. For me, beer is like enjoying a really good piece of bread. Grains and yeast that are mixed together to produce something that is so organic, hearty and satisfying.\n\nI tend to order dark beers, since I enjoy the deep robust flavors, and SanTan's Gordo Stout ($4.75) certainly fit the bill. With smooth notes of chocolate and coffee, this beer wasn't as heavy and belly filling as you might expect. The Gordo is one of the lowest alcohol content beer made here and, for me, one of the most flavorful.\n\nThe menu at SanTan ranges from salads and pizzas to sandwiches and burgers, with most being $12 or less. There are so many tasty appetizers that it's easy to go a little crazy and order too many. The Downtown Sliders ($8), three juicy mini burgers topped with beer-braised onions and beer mustard, were way too easy to eat. The SanTan Stingers ($8.50) are wonton wrappers filled with Applewood-smoked bacon and spicy jack cheese, then deep friend for a light crispy crunch. Soft Pub Pretzels ($6.50) were were another good choice.\n\nAs for entrees, the SanTan Ruben ($9) was piled high with juicy and flavorful corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Thousand Island dressing. The tender Rib-Eye Philly ($10.50) was wrapped in warm soft beer bread and packed with beef, peppers and onions, then slathered with house beer cheese. Each sandwich came with French fries that were worthy of their own plate.\n\nSanTan Brewery offers dessert, but you might want to learn from me and pace yourself."
0,"So, I was really excited.  Cause Dao Xiao Mian is possibly my favorite food, EVER.  Which is maybe why I was so disappointed.  I just saw the window, with dao xiao mian and dragged my friends in right away.  I was starving too.  I was born in Beijing, and coming from San Francisco which is dominated by sichuan and cantonese style Chinese food, I was really excited to eat northern chinese food again(yes, I know dao xiao mian is not only served in Northern China but that's where I've had the best mian.)\n\nThe mian was alright, it wasn't great, but the large price tag(only tomatoes and eggs!), and the knowledge of how much it costs in China, just didn't sit well with me.  The dumplings are just average, and they had the premade frozen taste to them.  They taste like what I make and really, that's not good for a restaurant with real chefs.  The Xiao long bao was just average, again though, I'm probably spoiled as I'm used to the crab meat and roe ones from Shanghai's Cheng Huang Miao.\n\nTo be completely fair though, I was comparing the prices to what I'd get in Beijing, for a little bit of homesickness, it was disappointing nonetheless.\n\nAlso, fish tanks were kinda weird for me.  Dead fish floating in there...."
1,"everything about this place is great.  staff is top notch.\n\ni hear they have regular celebrity sightings as well. last time i was there i saw Mike Panza.  That was pretty exciting\n\nAlso, Coheed + Nachos = Perfect"
1,Had visit as soon as I saw the ad walking through the canal shoppes..this place did not disappoint!!! The salad is out of this word good and fresh. Buddy's signature pizza is great.. And the cannoli is what we came for especially. It was way better than expected..can't wait for Carlo's to open across the way...so coming back!!
1,not your average Irish pub... on the weekends it can get packed... and upstars they have a DJ or band and it can get a lil crazy... on big nights it is hard to move beacuse of so many pople but i guess it is like that everywhere in CLT... i have never eaten there food... but have heard it is ok...
1,"If you are ever wondering off the strip and have a craving for shabu hot pot then look no further. At first, I was skeptical since it was just me and Dad at the restaurant at first but more people trickled through out the meal. The server came by frequently to refill our waters and add broth.  The dishes of meat are perfectly portioned and  the quality is top tier. The meats are thinly sliced and well marinated. It does help that there is a wide variety of sauces to choose from and different foods too. I was fond of the sauce station where you could control the amounts and types of ingredients to select from.  I was very impressed and the price you simply cannot beat for all you can eat at mid-day. \nYou can let the server know if you want hot, spicy or a not spicy chicken broth or 2 of the 3 split in a pot. I highly recommend the squid, tripe, fish fillets, shrimp, thinly sliced beef, fish cakes, soft tofu, Asian vegetables, and the pork belly. I hardly touched my water cup until the end. If you are not stuffed quite yet then you can either get a bowl or a few spoonfuls of the broth. Its quite tasty especially since the marinated meats were cooked in it during the course of the meal."
0,"I've been to Bluephies many, many times.  What kept me going back was the food - it is pretty damn good.  The prices are CRAZY, though - this is a DINER in MADISON not Aix en Provence. \n\nUnfortunately, the service is TERRIBLE!!!  \n\nDuring one visit, the patrons at the table next to us started changing their baby's diaper on the TABLE - the wait staff was unable to intervene - so my husband and I had to say something.  Who wants to see a baby's ass during dinner? not to speak of air-borne illnesses landing in our food ~ 3 feet away."
0,High pressure salesmen.  Watch out for the financing department.  Bait and switch dealership. \n\nToby's numbers dont add up.\n\nHorrible service.\n\nAvoid.
0,"Looks like this place is going down hill since the change in ownership.  The little store was out of stock on a lot of stuff, soda machine was broken and dirty towels on the counter. They rang me up for the wrong service and were just unfriendly, not rude but not nice either. I'll be driving the extra miles to find a true Danny's."
1,I met a friend here for brunch and it was absolutely delicious.  I highly recommend the Matador.  Things I would never have thought of to combine but it was absolutely delicious.  They also have a great bloody mary bar for only $5.  I would highly highly recommend this place. You can sit indoors or out.  They have misters so even in the heat it didn't feel that bad.  The servers were attentive but not in your face so we were able to sit and talk without feeling like we were being pushed out.  \n\nParking is difficult but they do have a free valet.
0,"A roach crawled across our table right after we received our bill. How convenient! Was this part of the authentic ambience? UGH. I finished that last roach..err, I mean roasted duck with glee. And those MSG pan-fried veggies? Oh honey, I requested a second serving.  Then that fucking cucaracha caught my eye in the very end.  In hindsight, I should've told them and cursed them out, but I just wanted to get the fuck out of there. Unfortunately, paranoia and thoughts of roaches crawling everywhere in the kitchen invaded my psyche afterwards. My insides felt like shit. \n\nWhen we arrived at Ichiza for dessert, I threw up in the bathroom. Glamorous, I know. But I wanted that shit out of my system. I downed a bottle of beer and water hoping it would make me feel better. It did. My brilliant rationale is the alcohol would help vanquish those germs. Thus, dodging food poisoining. I woke up today feeling fine. Yesterday was my first and last visit."
1,"So I will say that this place in and of itself is a fantastic theatre, HUGE, Comfortable, easy to get to, and lots of choices for food and candies. There is plentiful parking and even an auxiliary parking lot for really big hits. Which, oddly enough, gets full some of the time. The outside is extremely appealing with bright lights and lots of cars. It always seems like there is a movie you MUST see because of the amount of traffic in and out of this place. As you walk in, you approach the ticket counters immediately which are pretty speedy for the most part as well as a self check-in to your right if you purchased your tickets online. After checking in or purchasing your ticket you become overwhelmed with the smell of butter popcorn and other diet-killing foods like hot dogs and pretzel poppers.\n\nThe high ceilings make you feel like your in a mansion or a castle, almost preparing you for the wonder that movies bring. The \""gate keeper\"" as I like to call them is the person who tears your ticket initially and then directs you to the theatre your movie is playing in. With ticket in hand you walk to your destination (which can even be a 5 minute walk this place is so large) Or, if your lucky it is in IMAX which this theatre has the only other IMAX in a 75 mile radius. You sit into large and plush seats as you await the dimming of the theatre lights and your adventure to begin. Every time I have been here I have always gotten up from a movie feeling fine and not sore from some other movie theatre's seats. \n\nNow finally as to why I haven't given Star Cinema a 5 star rating. (Which seems ironic but oh well) And frankly this is more directed toward the company but the original company had the same issue as well. WAY TOO OVER PRICED. I understand that they have a quota to make etc. but this place is no different in where it count when I went here in 2000-2003 when I was a youngin' for almost twice the price. I remember paying (for a standard late night ticket) $5.25 now I pay $10 to sit in the exact same seats from when the place opened? MAYBE with a few more fast-food options that are the price of a steak meal at a 4 star restaurant. I think not my friends. \n\nI digress... It seems this doesn't stop people from seeing movies and hasn't COMPLETELY stopped me yet but it has decreased how much I did go. I only see 5-6 movies A YEAR now where it was almost 3-4 a month... I'd rather buy it on blu-ray for the same price a couple weeks later, turn off the lights at home, turn up the volume, enjoy a HUGE comfy chair and a Medium cooked steak. I know its the experience you go for which is nice a couple of times a year but no more than that.\n\n\""I have a very particular set of skills\"""
0,Some hot coffee please!! I've had warm coffee served to me about as often as I've had hot coffee served to me.
0,"The Avondale / Goodyear Sprouts is crap. I first shopped at Sprouts in Surprise and liked it. Moved to Goodyear and discovered this Sprouts is not good. \n\n1. Many of the staff are dregs. They are not friendly and don't care about their work. Sure, there are a few good ones but they are out numbered. \n\n2. The Organic veggie section is a joke. Many old and moldy veggies. \n\n3. One day I saw a 'dreg' stocking veggies in the organic section and noticed he was stocking non-organic carrots. I asked him about it. He had no idea and asked another veggie guy who said \""oops, those aren't organic'. Came back two days later to see the same non-organic carrots back on the organic shelf. WTF?\n\n4. One day they had some dairy items in a plastic display case on ice near check out. Only problem was the ice was all gone and the product was room-temperature warm. \n\nI have lost trust in this sore and Sprouts in general. \n\nAlso Sprouts has gone 'corporate' and lost their brand focus. You can find Sprouts branded baked goods with HFC in it. It is a premium product yet they can't spend 1 or 2 cents more for sugar? That means the bean counters have taken over. THey have lost their focus. \n\nUnfortunately thee isn't an alternative in the west valley."
0,"Food was bad, made my son sick all night. I had to take my taco back 2x because it was wrong and then so soggy I could not pick it up. My daughter could not finish the albondigas soup because it was so bad. Everyone claimed the food was the worst Mexican food they had eaten. The enchilada sauce was like ketchup and the albondigas was like watery tomato soup with a meatball."
0,The food is nothing to brag about. I left here and immediately felt sick to my stomach. I went here with a group of people. No one really loved their meal. There was something on my burger and I couldn't tell you what it was. I think it was burnt cheese but I am not sure. The decorations are good service was OK food not so great.
1,"I love this restaurant. I'm here every 2-3 weeks. I'm not a crawfish eater but the shrimp is delicious. They never fail to serve it the way I like it, plain and not spicy! Service is quick, wait times on the weekends are crazy but so worth the wait! They recently opened another location so I'm sure wait time have decreased dramatically. I recommend visiting here if you love seafood, also great for first dates. :)"
1,"BF and I are a big fan of Bobby Flay, so we were pretty excited to eat at Mesa. Sadly, Bobby was not there, and to my chagrin our server said we just missed him; he was there the week before. Ah well. \n\nThe restaurant is bright and elegantly decorated, colorful, and all the waitstaff were very professional and friendly. They have several lounge \""cubicles\"" to wait while your table is being setup too, which I thought was pretty smart for groups that are waiting - you can still talk and everyone can sit and face each other while you wait. \n\nWe ate:\n3 course meal of: \n1) Blue corn pancake: bbq duck + habanero chile + star anise sauce - Pretty good, but a little on the salty side\n2) New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich: pretty good, light and fresh, came with Mexican spiced fries too that were really good. This is what everyone calls the #1 dish here, but I really think that award goes to the corn tamale (below). \n3) Panna Cotta: SO GOOD - nice and light and the fruit was soaked in some type of liquor and really fresh and ripe. \n\n\nOthers:\nAppetizers: \nCremini Mushroom Quesadilla: pretty good, but will try something else next time\nTiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale: OMG I could eat this all day, every day, for the rest of my life. The shrimp was nicely seasoned and tender, not overcooked, the tamale was sweet and savory, the white corn was fresh and drowned in this yummy creamy corn sauce. YUM....\n\nFriend got the Chile Rellenos, which was also quite good. Melt in your mouth cheesy-ness. Mmm\n\nGet the corn tamale!!"
0,"Dr. Baig has poor bedside manner and has no clue how to be a well rounded doctor. He may be a good surgeon (however I would not let him operate on me so I will never find out) but I have been to doctors that care about their patients, that don't interrupt their patients, and that have some empathy for their patients and that are reasonably punctual). Unfortunately, Dr. Baig during my office visits has exhibited none of these critical characteristics. I know there are much better choices out there unfortunately from Dr Baig's demeanor it is obvious that he doesn't know that.  His staff is nice, no issues. Also, he was over 40 minutes late to all of my appointments."
1,Loved this place.  The owners were the ones to serve us. Very attentive and excellent thai flavor. \n\nOur new favorite thai spot is here!  We usually hit Archis or Le Thai but neither of those compare to this yummy gem. \n\nPricing was reasonable and the food was hot and fresh. Great service and great people. Love love love it!
1,"I've been to The Vig Uptown several times now and I love it, especially during Happy Hour!  The decor is so stylish and everyone is friendly and helpful.  I get the Flatbread Pizza with Tandoori Chicken every time, it's that good.  My husband has ordered something different each time and has liked them all.  Just a word of warning, concrete floors.  So when the place is full it's very loud.  Not a good place for friends to catch up as you have to practically yell at each other.  But when you're eating food this good, who's going to do much talking anyway?"
0,"It always cracks me up going out in Scottsdale..& just when I say to myself to just say no... One of my friends drags me out...I've been here a few times.. Consistently it's the same scene of Scottsdale junk.. Creepy dudes playing grab ass if your just trying to walk through the place.. Or bartenders with inconsistent drink charges.. The place is always overcrowded.. I mean the dudes outside are there to monitor how one looks & whether one is worthy to enter, right?! How about counting how many peeps you allow in.. We never stay here too long... Music is good... Grey goose tastes the same at another place where there's actual room\nto move.. Without some strange Affliction wearing tools hands on me..."
1,"I recently brought my boss's  2012 Range Rover to fix knocked off right side mirror.\nI was referred to Updated Auto from Land Rover. \nThe BEST!!! They're very professional and outstanding service, very friendly.\nI really wanted to a big thank to Elie,Craig, James, Robert and all team member.Especially I'd like to thank to Elie , He was helpful honest and thoughtfulness guy.\nI highly recommend this place and hopefully  they will be 5 Star long time!!!!!"
0,"OMG....last night was a nightmare. We were (not) served by the most incompetent server,who was rivaled in his rudeness and seconded by the manager on duty.  Two drinks ordered were unavailable as there was none of the requested mixer( orange juice and 7up, or Sierra mist)\nWe waited (me without a beverage) for 35 minutes for our pizza (they were not overly busy) at which point we enquired of the manager as to when it might be expected.  He disappeared and returned several mi urea later to inform us that it would take another 25 to 35 minutes. We left!.... avoid this restaurant. Grimaldis in Old Town, Scottsdale is fabulous.  Go there .   Had to give it 1 star, but it actually this particular store deserves zero.  Get a new manager and fire the bald waiter."
0,The manager was rude! He wouldn't honor his own coupon because he said the printing company messed up! Then he said I couldn't get the Thursday drink special because I didn't have two people in my party! I told him it was unacceptable and he said well leave then if you don't like it! Upon my exit he resorted to name calling! Unfortunately he lost our business forever! Take our advise go to Los Arcos! We did and loved it!
0,"Good food. Unfortunately (or fortunately for us), we sniffed out a scam. Check your bills. They overcharged us by +\\~ $100. After we alerted the cashier to the mistake, we were offered a shoddy explanation that would leave even the most trusting soul saying \""hmmmmm\"". I surmise there is a rotten apple amongst the staff. Overall, good food. Nice people. ...But something smells funny."
0,"I feel sorry for Texans if they think THIS is good BBQ!  Go to Joe's BBQ in Gilbert.\n\nWe were excited to try a new BBQ joint closer to our house since we normally go to Joe's BBQ in downtown Gilbert..  Now listen fellow yelpers, you have never steered me wrong.  So I was convinced this was going to be good, after reading all of the rave reviews and seeing a 4 start avg for this place.  I cannot say that I agree with the good reviews of this place at all.\n\nWe arrived at 5:45 PM on a Sunday eve and were cheerfully greeted by a young lady who helped us figure out how it worked.  You grab a bottled beer or soda (or they have cups where you order for fountain drinks) and then order at the counter.  No line and we got up to the counter and I decided on the moist brisket, given the good reviews I had read on here.  I watched them cut it up and throw it onto some wax paper and put it in our feeding trough (some crazy basket that they put all of your food into, as there are no trays or plates!).  I decided on beans and creamed corn and then the guy asked if I wanted white or wheat bread. I chose white and he slapped 5 pieces of Wonder bread into the trough.  I don't get the bread part and they give you way too much.  Off we went with our basket of food and we found a picnic table to sit at where we didn't have to eat with strangers at one of the other long 20 person tables, like on a cruise ship!  We then checked out the condiments and I grabbed a paper container filled with pickles.  Had both the sissy BBQ sauce and the hotter one and they both were ok.  Nothing to write home about.  The creamed corn looked and tasted like someone just took corn niblets from a can and put it into some cream.  It was not tasty at all.  The beans were not bad.  But the moist brisket....it was moist alright - it was oozing fat!  I think 50% of the meat was fat.  I was somewhat disgusted.  My husband had the same thing and he did not like it either.  Luckily, he had chosen Lay's BBQ chips for his side. Cannot go wrong there!!  Pretty sad when the best part of your meal is a bag of Lay's BBQ potato chips.  \n\nI don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back \""ya'all\""."
0,"Really small. $25 cover unless you're a hotel guest. I would've felt robbed if I payed the cover. \n\nSnooty bartender. I asked if they had any ales or IPAs and the bartender gave me a snooty attitude response saying \""you really think we'd serve ales in a stylish place like this??\"". Definitely did not need that attitude since they were people all over the club with Bud Light bottles everywhere. Yeah, you're too classy for ales but yet serve the lowest common denominator beer that you can get by the dozen for $5 at a gas station. \n\nOh yeah, my friend was trying to meet girls there, but apparently all of the girls in the club are hookers, so good luck meeting a genuine person there. \n\nWould not recommend unless you're a sleezebag that loves crap beer and STDs, then by all means go for it."
0,By far the slowest Starbucks. ... 15 min for a cup of coffee after ordering. .. really?
0,"I mean, I guess it's sort of a Madison Institution, right?\n\nBrats are basic, no-frills, and mediocre at best. You're much better going to another place that serves quality, local cuisine. Cheese curds are on par with Culver's...which is saying something (and not a good something, I might add). Fries are curly and pretty tasty.\n\nBeer is pretty pricey for a Madison dive. \n\nService is always excellent, bartenders nice. Cool outdoor patio. Food quality and prices makes this a 2 star joint, but it's important to note the service--which is, as said before, always great."
0,"Good location but they don't have much competition in the Vegas Valley so I think the prices are pumped up a bit more than if they had a major competitor. This lack of competition also makes them not care about marketing. Every time I call for pricing and availability the people give you a feeling you are bothering them if you aren't a big player and building a casino. No reflection on the yard guys,,,,, they are helpful and friendly....also the effect shows in lack of a web site with prices and inventory that would eliminate me bothering the counter help and let me estimate my own jobs.....but they are the big player in town and I'm just a little guy....I would give them a 5 star review  if they would get a web site with prices and material. I don't care if the counter guys were cranky, I'm not looking for drinkin' buddies.."
0,"Wow, after reading everyones reviews, I know I'm right about our experience last weekend.  We've been going here to eat off and on over the past 7 years or so.  We've always enjoyed our meal. It's been about a year since we've gone. \n\nThe menu has changed somewhat so we couldn't order what we normally use to order.  Wow, terrible choice.  We decided to order light and just order a  spicy tuna and salmon roll for each of us.  They were so hot we couldn't eat them.  My husband didn't think the rice was made that well.  My husband and I never go home with take out when we go out for Sushi.  Out of 12 pieces each, we each ate 4.  What does that tell you?   I told the waiters working at the counter that it was to hot and they said that we ordered Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon.  No one said,  \""we're sorry, what can do we do for you to make it better\"". \n\nMy children who are in their 20's tried it and also agreed with us.   They are both avid sushi eaters.  I called the owner and talked to him personally that evening.    He said he would check into it for me and get back to me with what he found out.  He never did.  I called him a few minutes ago.    He said that his workers made it normal and that is the way they make it. They didn't put any extra hot spice in it.    I guess the customer is always wrong.  We will never step foot into this establishment and give them our money.  There are to many other sushi places  in the Scottsdale area to go out to eat.  The sushi rolls at Safeway are better and more enjoyable."
0,"Horrible restaurant. We were seated by very unfriendly waitresses, ordered, the food didn't taste well. Fried rice was horrible, I got the hot and sour noodle, it was pretty ok but a bowl of noodle 2:1 soups. So I asked for more soup, and yes, they are giving you chicken soups and it cost $3 :) sweet huh? A rice bowl size of soup cost $3. Well, I saw a group sat, ordered and left after the first dish arrived, so I DONT THINK I WILL EVER COME AGAIN."
0,"how come this place still open. I will think because the people that come here have never try REAL TAPAS so they don't know the real flavor.This place is really bad. The restaurant sell tapas well let me tell you this  place  is not tapas plus the chef here need to go to Spain to learn how to cook some real tapas.   The paella was really bad no flavor, the sangria no good. No stars from me"
1,"We just moved out here this year.  We've been to 3 indian restaurants in Vegas so far, and this one is the best by far!  Soups are fantastic, the vindaloo, rogan josh and curry dishes are awesome, and the drinks are reasonably priced.\n\nBest indian restaurant in Vegas IMO."
0,One star for not breaking a $100 bill if total is $20 bucks.
0,This place is horrible. My bf and I stopped here because we had a groupon but it wasn't worth it. We watched as other people got seated before us even though our name was on the list. It took about 10-15 mins to get waited on and then almost an hour to get our food. Our waitress didn't stop to check on us once or apologize for the wait. The people next to us were being completely ignored by their waitress and waited an hour for food as well. It took forever as well to get the check. Maybe they should be better prepared for a Saturday morning. You couldn't pay me to come back here.
0,"We somehow ended up eating here, cause everyone was starving and we were walking past this place. SO not worth the $25. And you have to pay an additional $5 for unlimited mimosas. Most buffets already include the mimosas in the price. We could have paid an extra couple of bucks and went to a buffet that had seafood. \n\nI was so disappointed that I didn't even take photos of the food. The only thing I ate here was the Lobster Ravioli, Smoked Salmon and a piece of Lasagna. There was nothing that stood out about the food.\n\nI wouldn't recommending coming here to anyone. Spend a few extra bucks, and go to another buffet. I wish we had gone to Paris' Buffet or even Rio's. :("
0,Alamo  at Mc Carran is  the worst ever. Paid for Escalade got a very old looking ford.Kicker was while we were trying to get reduction for being overcharged my sons backpack was STOLEN by their personnel-during the ten minutes we were disputing the bill.They took his Christmas present watch and his golf tournament polo shirt and phone charger.He was heartbroken and the employees stonewalled for the employee who was in the vehicle. The employee had mysteriously gone on an unscheduled break and did not return. Despite this we have received no response from Alamo-they do not return our calls.We tried to file a report with the Airport police but we told they could not take the report because we were no longer in Vegas??? Airport police told us we should file a report where we live-unheard of.The employees now have the perfect set up to rip off customers because you are left with no recourse when you return home.
0,"If you are in a hurry, forget about it at this place. That is all I can say."
1,"I went to the one on Eastern in Henderson in the Gold's Gym shopping plaza.  My friend took me there and she had the Summer Ramen Dish Special which was corn, tomato sauce and was really tasty. I had the cool noodles which was zesty and light for a lunch meal.  It came with the Yuzi lemony sauce. It was good eats! This was back in 2012 or 2013."
0,"When this place opened, I kept looking for yelp reviews.  But they were all 5* posts from complete unknown users.  Soon these reviews were filtered off.  Not many other businesses have such a disproportionate amount of filtered 5* reviews.  It's a little obvious :/\n\nI rarely write reviews, but I'm going to start because of things like this.  The place is not bad.  The owners are friendly, but I couldn't be their friend if you know what I mean.  The quality of the cookies are ok considering the cost.  Dreyers is dreyers.\n\nThey would have gotten a 3* review probably, but I knocked off 1 for being fake.  They called their ice cream \""super premium\"".  Huh?  Compounded with the flood of fake yelp reviews, I knocked off a star to help average out the fake reviews.  Maybe I'll restore it when I feel like we don't need vigilante justice for these slick business owners.\n\nIn all, I think these guys will do well.  My friend had something at Cookiez the same day I had Slickables.  Slickables ice cream sandwich wins, but doesn't win my heart."
1,"Judging a pho restaurant is pretty easy: try their pho at 9am when they first open and before you add anything to the broth see how it tastes. If it tastes good at 9am the restaurant is very good. In this case, we came to Pho 1 at 8:55am and I was a little nervous as some restaurants like to make their broth at 7am and its honestly not ready at 9am or even 10am. In this case, the pho had been cooking all night and it was incredible. If you like pho I would highly, highly recommend Pho 1."
1,"Man, I don't get how so many people down this place. I've never had anything but great experiences, whether ordering for delivery or going in.\n\nTheir pies are the best that I have tasted in Pittsburgh (so far). So many other joints I have tried mess up the crust, which once you've screwed up the base you've got nothing else. But their pizza crust is thick and chewy, just the way I like it.\n\nI love how they load their pizzas up with toppings (another thing that some pizza places skimp on, which makes for an angry Quay!). Everything tastes fresh and incredibly flavorful.\n\nWe ordered in from Genoa's on the nights where we really don't feel like cooking. They were a godsend when we were in the process of moving. We've always managed to get our food delivered well before the quoted time, piping hot, and the delivery guys and the guys who take our order are always pleasant."
1,"I stayed here overnight for business and was quite impressed.  We got a good rate through Travelocity ($100 per night).  This was, by far, the best $100 hotel I have ever stayed at.  \n\nValet Parking was very convenient and the staff was responsive and friendly.  Same with the front desk staff.  As I typically do at high rise hotels, I asked for a room on the highest floor available.  From the 12th floor I had a decent view of the strip.  Upon entering my room, the lights turned on, the curtains opened, and the TV began playing a welcoming tune.  \n\nThe bedside alarm allowed me to turn on a gradual wakeup system where the lights would illuminate gradually; the curtains would open; and the TV would come onto a station of my choice at a volume I chose.  \n\nThe bathroom and shower in the standard room was fantastic.  Nicely detailed, and great water pressure (for Vegas).  \n\nThe hotel casino is standard, but could use a few more tables.  And as is typical with most Vegas hotels, the offer service at some restaurants 24/7, which was key for my 5 am breakfast.\n\nI would stay here again, especially if offered another great deal like the one I got through Travelocity."
1,"Leaving this review here because I couldn't find the Maryland Parkway location on Yelp yet, but that's the location I'm reviewing -\n\nAllow me to describe this place in one word: OMNOMNOM. \n\nAt first, I thought, great, just what we need, another taco/burrito/bowl place within walking distance of UNLV (others being Chipotle and Cafe Rio). We're also not needing in hawaiian food either. But, Braddahs knocked it out of the park. Hawaiian mexican might be a way to describe it? Whatever the style is, it was *good*. \n\nWe were welcomed with samples to try the menu (they just opened this location within the past few days) - and were sold right there. I had a steak & chicken salad. Delicious. If I had one critique, it was that the pork by itself was a bit on the salty side, but I could see that being less of a problem in the context of other things on the plate. \n\nThen, coconut bark happened. If I wasn't already in love with the place, I am now.\n\nThe owner (I presume that who it was) was welcoming and personable, helping out the service team and greeting customers. It didn't feel fake-servicey like at Chipotle, where they look up and begrudgingly moan, \""welcome to chipotle.\"" \n\nTL;DR- Food is great. Coconut bark is amazing. Can't wait to go back (and for the Green Valley location to open.)"
1,"XS is a fun club! It's definitely one of my favorites in Vegas! Went here twice last year! (yea my group of friends liked it that much).\n\nThe music is really good both nights we went, and the crowd was alright as well. It does get pretty packed, but what do you expect? it's one of the hottest spots in Vegas.\n\nI'll be coming back by the end of the month!"
1,"I only went in to buy a few fish the other day, but the two ladies who were working in the aquarium area were so helpful its my new favorite fish place. They explained what fish would be best for my biTube, introduced me to a nice snail to clean my tank, and overall just made the experience very nice, quick and satisfying. I'll be going back for sure.\n\nBased on the other reviews, not sure I'd ever bring my dogs in there, and if they do actually sell dogs and cats that's very bad mojo. However, for fish, its a-ok."
1,I am in town for work and I decided to order food from here. The food was awesome! I ordered the People's Special Biryani and they brought the food right to my hotel room. I will definitely order from here again the next time I'm in town.
0,"I rarely am motivated enough to write reviews but after tonight's awful experience at Los Sombreros, I felt I must.  We are visiting my parents and they were very excited to try this \""new\"" restaurant that had recently been reviewed in the paper.  How sorry they are.\n\nOur party of 7 called at 6:30pm and asked about arriving at 7pm for a party of seven.  \""No problem\"" and \""what's your name?\"" was the response and off we went.  We arrived and the greeter/hostesses were rude and said they didn't show a reservation for us.  We pointed it out and they said they couldn't honor/accommodate us.  As they saw our jaw drops, they akwardly walked off and tried to piece something together.  They offered us a table in the bar OR said we could wait 20 minutes for a table in the main dining room.  Having 3 kids with us, we elected for the bar.  We were seated at about 7:05 and then, after having our orders for drinks/food taken at 7:25, we still didn't receive anything (drinks or chips) until 7:45.  The drinks were wrong.  My 6-year old daughter ordered lemonade and was told they had it;  they didn't and brought her a Sprite.  She said she had ordered lemonade and they said they didn't hear her. They said they had \""homemade\"" limeade so she agreed.  When it arrived at 8:00, she tasted it and told us it tasted weird.  My husband tried it and said it was margarita mix.  Seriously?   After numerous drink mix-ups and having servers come and verify and re-verify certain food orders, they brought our food out at 8:15.  Things were looking up!  \n\nThe food:  2 of us got the smoked chicken enchiladas and they were good.  One of us got the carnitas and he said it was just \""ok.\""  The rice tasted awful but the beans were decent.  The food was all pretty cold (definitely the kitchen had not timed the food prep/service well) but we were done complaining.  It was up to them and they seemed to know we were not happy as the owner continued to avoid us like the plague despite her servers telling her how badly things were going at our table.  Chips were good, hot sauce was watered down and almost tasteless.\n\nThe check:  Upon the conclusion of our meal, the check was delivered.  There was an add'l drink on there (the extra Sprite from the earlier mix up) and upon us asking, they responded but we brought you the limeade.  Well, that was on there too!  Also, the mandatory gratuity was included b/c we were a party of 7.  Are you kidding me?  The owner is there, never comes over to apologize and then they charge us for everything and include gratuity?  I spoke with the server, told her that despite her best efforts, it was a misreable experience and that we were very disappointed having driven 30 minutes.  She apologized and said she had spoken to the owner and told her but that she didn't care.  Seriously?  \n\nI will NEVER waste my time here again and am flabbergasted that this place is still in business after 8 weeks.  It will not last given it's current state.  They were clearly understaffed and yet the owner continued to seat large parties despite the obvious breakdown in all aspects. \n\nDo not waste your time going to this location.  This place needs a manager and obviously NOT the owner running the place.  She was rude (I saw her get into it with 2 other customers) and I saw 2 tables leave.  She obviously doesn't care about what the customers think and she avoided our table going so far as to hide in the kitchen until we left.   Shameful and awful.  This review would not have been written had she come out, apologized for the lack of service and bought us a round of drinks just to show that she was committed to making a bad situation better."
0,"This is the worst little Caesars I've been to. Now I already have really low expectations as it is hot n ready, but every time I get it the pizza tastes like cardboard! Like it's been in a fridge for a week. Since I live close to here I've found that bad pizza is consistent and it was never a fluke. I even tried box just ordering it fresh and waiting around 7 minutes for it and it still came out awful. The crust was too chewy and overcooked, the sauce/ toppings were skimpy (there was a full one and a half inch ring of crust around it), and the cheese was burnt. You'd expect they could at least make good fresh pizza. I'd skip this little Caesars and head to the Pizza Hut across the street or the little Caesars on Val vista and university"
1,"If you are looking for the best apartments in Scottsdale, I would definitely recommend Liv North Scottsdale. The staff is so nice and helpful. I would give them a call to be put on the list for when they open this fall!"
1,"I want to start off by saying that I did not purchase my dress here. It was my first stop on my dress hunting adventure. Lauren was the consultant who I worked with. I just want to say, she was awesome! She kept pulling styles close to the ones I liked so I could try more on. The only thing I did not like was that she kept pulling styles over my budget, even though they were only $100 or $200 over, I had already told her that I could NOT go over my budget. There was simply no wiggle room. But she is a saleswoman so she was just doing her job. The shop was clean and organized and they had lots of accessories to try on with the dresses. In the end I found a dress that I really liked, but I found one that literally brought me to tears at another shop. I would definitely recommend them to any bride."
0,This place is okay. The waiter was horrible and barely checked on us. The food was also not too good. It was very bland and didn't have a lot of taste to it. I will not be coming back.
0,"i think 'meh, i've experienced better' pretty much sums up my experience at the alexander graham bell.  we went for some drinks before dinner on a work night out and at 4:30pm the place was absolutely packed and just getting more crowded.  we luckily sourced a table as i basically threw myself and my belongings on before anyone else could claim it but then i had to ask the bar staff to wipe it down as there was spilled beer covering it.  the girl did her best, but she had a tiny cloth and there was loads of beer and the table didn't exactly get cleaned....\n\ndrinks were average, it's hard to mess up a G&T and the girls said the white wine was nice.  but the clientele was rather unsavoury with random guys trying to talk to us claiming they wanted advice about good places to go to on a friday night.  i feel like they were trying to chat us up while most of them were well around the age of my father...so awkward.\n\nmaybe this just isn't my type of place... i mean i see the appeal, fairly large space and cheap drinks but to be honest i rather pay an extra quid or two to be in a more pleasant environment when men the age of my father don't try to hit on me.  it's unlikely i'll be back unless forced to go...."
1,"We stayed here when we saw Underworld perform nearby.\n\nI loved the look of it from the outside. The casino is amazing and 'The Joint' is fabulous. Hart and Huntington Tattoo was awesome to see.\n\nThe room was a regular room and it wasn't anything fancy. You could have told me it was a Holiday Inn Express and I wouldn't have argued. It worked for us because we were out all night anyway. Location was key for us. I don't even remember walking back to the room to be honest.\n\nAlso...the circular venues and rooms and etc downstairs is confussing. I kept getting lost (not because I was drunk) but it was just confussing. I think if I were drunk and without my man, I could have gotten into trouble...\n\nWe'll be back I'm sure and we'll try something new."
0,"I went to Benjarong today to meet up with a friend for dinner. I was excited at the opportunity to try another Thai place. This may sound completely odd, but the year and a half I spent in Detroit really increased my Thai snobbery. It's been hard finding a great Thai place here. \n\nThe restaurant is tucked away in a strip mall next to a church. The sign is hard to see from the road and I went past it the first time and almost missed it the 2nd time too. However, the inside is very cut and cozy. It's not very large and has a warm and inviting feel. \n\nFor an appetizer we had crispy spring rolls, which were pretty much your average spring roll. Not too bad, but nothing fancy or exceptionally spectacular either.\n\nFor dinner I decided to try their version of Evil Jungle Princess with medium spice as I usually get. Typically medium ranges from tolerable to almost not tolerable. This time it tasted like they had put absolutely no spice in at all. It wasn't bad and I did bring the rest home to hav tomorrow, but it's not nearly as flavorful as other Thai places I have been to in the past. \n\nThe service is good and the prices are very reasonable. They also have an extensive menu. However, the Thai was too Americanized for me."
0,Most rude service ever! Expect eye rolling and annoyance for asking any questions. Do not support businesses that do not understand customer service. I definitely WON'T!
1,"Finally tried this place after eyeing it for months! I loved the drinks and the tacos are pretty good. We ordered carne asada,fish and shrimp tacos and my friend got the tamales plate that came with beans on the side and some veggies. The tacos were good a little pricey but other than that good! My friend said the beans were kind of bland and the veggies didn't really go with the plate but she enjoyed her tamales. So over all this place is good the drinks are awesome and the vibe is trendy and chill. I'll be going again for round 2 going to give it another try!"
1,Amazing Gyro must go it was as tender as it was delicious.
1,"Die Kantine wird vom gleichen Unternehmen betrieben, wie auch die im Technologiepark und in der PTV AG.\n\nVom Ambiente im Innenraum eher ein wenig n\u00fcchtern, allerdings mit einer tollen Terasse im Sommer.\n\nVom Kochen verstehen die K\u00f6che was. Das meiste ist frisch zubereitet und es gibt wenig Wiederholungen. Eigentlich ist f\u00fcr jeden immer was dabei und ein vegetarisches Gericht ist auch immer auf der Karte.\n\nAbsolut empfehlenswert! \u00dcber die Homepage kann man die Wochenpl\u00e4ne einsehen."
0,"Here's the thing.  I own these shoes.  Love the designer, HATED employees here.  We were on our way to the gym so yes I wasn't all dolled up, but they treated us like we had NO business to be in there.\n\nMakes me want to not own these shoes anymore if this is how the staff will treat people.  HELLOOOOOO you are in the Forum not on Rodeo Drive, if you are judging your customers as soon as they walk through the door you will lose a lot of business."
1,Warm and comforting \nStaff very knowledgable \nThe 'Water of Life'!
0,"I gave two for the fountain view , food was horrid, salad wilted lettuce which was brown on edges , waitress recommended Mediterranean grilled vegetables ,added chicken ,dry tasteless broccoli\nUs yellowed , so disappointed. Service was good ,food horrid again."
1,"Holy crap this place is so damn good! I'm still dreaming of their reuben sandwhiches all the way from Austin, TX. This is a must eat!"
0,"Not a bad spot for lunch, however it can be crowded and hard to move around in. \n\nThe stir fry bowl was very fresh, the one thing I noticed was that they probably don't clean their stir fry grill that often between bowls as some of my beef tasted like fish (not good for those with food allergies), but I would assume you could ask them to clean it first.\n\nCould have been a bit more beef in the bowl for the price.\n\nNot sure if I'd go again."
0,Terrible! The worst korean restaurant I've ever eaten! Never will I visit this one any more.\n\nNo more words besides swear!
1,"I may have to create a new list for places like Bistro La Bon...I think I may call it \""Nom Fest\"" because I was in absolute heaven during their Sunday smorgasbord brunch. \n\nOh my goodness oh my goodness...whether you favor gratins or chocolate waffles, lip-smacking french toast or creamy orzo salad, buttery brisket or delectable coconut macaroons, there is something for everybody here. And, honestly, this buffet (for $14.95 per person) is a pretty sweet deal any way you cut it. A few of the standouts in this tasty spread...\n\nMacaroons: ZOMG. I was ready to open my purse and go all covert ops on the buffet to smuggle out a tray of these perfectly crafted coconut macaroons. No joke, they are some of the best I've ever had. \n\nFrench Toast: Buttery, velvety magic. Perfectly made with the right amount of syrup. Just an FYI - you'll have to order the chocolate waffles and this French toast with your server, even though it's included in the buffet price. \n\nSweet Potato Gratin: It sounds as delicious as it tasted. My tastebuds were dancing a jig of massive proportions. \n\nSo, um, yeah, I'll be back to Bistro La Bon in the very near future. NOM!"
1,So good! Love starting my morning off here!
1,I love this place for a cool miami feel for sushi. The pear martini is great as well as the sashimi. I enjoy the scenery and ambiance of this place because it is very open and inviting. The lollipop rolls are also very good if you're looking for something healthy.
1,"Went to Cafe Heidelberg for the first time last week for lunch (we have lived here almost 10 years). Was excellent all around. We were stationed in central Germany in the Air Force and found this restaurant be be on par with what we had there. I had the 2 sausage plate. The beer brat was a little plain but very good. Could have used more spice. The red cabbage was outstanding as was the side of spatzle. My wife had the schnitzel which was very good, again could have used a little more spice. My mother-in-law had the liverwurst and said it was outstanding. Service was very friendly and  attentive, but the restaurant only had 2 other tables occupied. It was a little pricey $80 for the 3 of us, but absolutely worth it. Not a place I would go to weekly, but a couple times a month for date night absolutely!!"
1,"love their soup noodle, the soup taste so good. Price is very good. But bad customer service + long waiting time."
1,"I like this place. We just ate there last night. Yum! I got a burrito enchilada stye (totally key if you want it in red sauce with tons of extra cheese :)) I got a bean and cheese burrito. They don't use lard in their beans for any of you vegetarians out there (vegetable oil they claim) and they were good. My hubby got the guacamole burrito with chicken and really enjoyed it. This place is definitely worthy or a return visit. The staff was nice and service was prompt. Plus, we had dinner for the two of us for $19 prior to tip -- which isn't bad for getting waited on :)"
1,"I've used Eli and his team 3 separate times now. Once to hang my flat screen tv and a very large mirror, another time to hang curtain rods and some pendant lights and finally a third time to install a dog door. They are consistently punctual, are available to do work on Saturdays and always do a fantastic job. What more could you ask for?\n\nIt's really nice to have some professional and reliable go-to guys for handling projects around the house. I used to think I could do all this stuff myself but paying these pros just saves me so much time and hassle. They are worth EVERY PENNY!\n\nThanks Eli and team!\n\nScott"
0,"The hostess in front was not at all friendly. She didn't even welcome us. Just asked for name and party. That was kind of a bad start... The wait was 50 minutes for Sunday at 12... We waited the 50 minutes Bc I had wanted to try this place for a while....we were seated in 53 mins. \n\nThe waitress Megan took 10 mins to greet us at our table ad she wasn't all that helpful. When I asked if the waffles were good and she replied, \""yeah.\""  Let me tell you after she too our order she did NOTHING for us. We actually ordered another side dish through another waiter.  \n\nThe busboy was great! Always filling up our water cups. We personally gave him cash tip and left our waitress with a 5% tip Bc again she did NOTHING. She didn't even serve our food get us condiments. NOTHING. \n\nMy husband got the ham steak which took 20 mins to rcv. I ordered the waffles and it took 30 mins. Again I ordered waffles- not chicken and waffles just waffles... 30 mins. \n\nThe male waiters were all very nice and attentive to us and our needs.. All of the women workers seemed to have a pretty large stick up their............ \n\nI will not return here again.. So disappointed in the upgraded ihop/Denny's food.  Not worth the wait, money or rude service. Blah!  \n\nThe service was so bad that my husband who never complains about anything, was even pissed and called the manager... He spoke with \""yushon?\"" And she offered to pay for our next meal which we all know is the restaurants way of saying \""shut your complaining\"""
1,"I love this place.  New Era hats are buy one get one 50% off.  Jackets, pullovers, hoodies are 20% off.  Prices are very competitive, and the employees are friendly, and helpful.  No other sports apparrel retailer anywhere can offer such great deals on New Era, Nike, and Addidas.   The only downside that I see is that they don't have a huge selection, and are limited on sizes."
1,I just stopped by to get my oil change and I was very surprise with the Manager and the staff at this Jiffy Lube location. They work well and fast.  I definitely recommend them. Keep up the good work
1,"My new favorite spot in Old Town! Will definitely be back and become a regular. So beautiful inside when you walk up those stairs. Sat outside on the patio and it overlooked Scottsdale Rd. Great hand crafted drinks that were paired with amazing food!! Had the best service hands down. From the moment that we walked up to the hostess stand Sydney (sp) was nice and showed us to a great table. Loren came out and was so nice and personable explained the delicious menu! Nicole came to greet us and was warm and inviting. Told us all the great things to eat and drink. Ask for Nicole, she's the best! Loved Tracy and her accent! We both have a love for champagne. Met Tommy and he was so nice. Don, his father, constructed a beautiful place! I'm completely smitten with this place. Definitely my go to place, from here on out! Definitely telling everyone about this fabulous place!!"
1,"I've never lived in Madison, but as a visitor I've been to this place a half dozen times over the last few years, often when in town solo, and always have ended up having a good time.  5 stars for a bar with a great jukebox and friendly staff where even if you go alone you don't end up drinking alone- no attitude from the friendly, reasonably social fellow drinkers."
1,Can you believe we got a table on Valentines day? I'm an idiot since I don't celebrate holidays but Red Devil doesn't take reservation.\nI had the stand by spaghetti and italian sausage. My friend had lasagna.\nAs usual the service was excellent and the food delicious. The 40 minute wait went be quickly since we already had so much to talk about.\nThis is just a great local spot.
1,"AMAZING food, drinks, and service!!!! It is nice to splurge once in a while, and I recommend this place for Romantic dinners, or maybe even a business dinner!!! The Lobster and steak is to die for. Extremely classy place. Very expensive, but was worth it! The Champagne was flowing, and we were front row to the GREAT live band!!! This is a MUST TRY place in Scottsdale!!!!"
0,"Not going back.\n\nI used to go here all the time... when I started going here about 2 years ago, the place was great.  Not conservative with drinks and the food was pretty tasty.  The waiters were nice and friendly.\n\nCame here last nght with a large party of friends and I was not pleased and that opinion was shared by everybody at my table.\n\nWe were crammed in their largest booth... not a problem.  \n\nBut it is a problem when someone has to leave for a minute and so you don't want to make everybody move again, so you come back and sit on the end right?  \n\nWaiter didn't like that and had the cojones to ask us to not move seats.\n\nI understand that it's inconvenient for the waiter as far as the check out goes, but I'm sorry, it's not about them.  If you're paying my bill, you can call the shots on where I sit in my booth.  But since you're not, we will figure out who gets what bill especially when all of us have our own separate checks anyway.  We know who got what and we'll help the waiter figure it out because we aren't total assholes... so don't ask us to not move seats when we aren't in chairs.\n\nI had the california shrimp salad... used to be better.  The dressing wasn't that great, a couple tomatos in it weren't as fresh as I felt they should be.\n\nBut the kicker... after nobody had had no more than 2 beers and it was clear we had DD's (I was one of them), we were told that they were cutting us off.  Yes, we are loud and have fun and laugh, but isn't that what you're supposed to do???  \n\nApparently that's not ok with this Applebees.\n\nBad enough, those of us that were drinking something other than alcoholic didn't get any refills of what we were drinking... \n\nI'm not going back.  It has just gotten worse and worse there and so they might as well just shut down their bar and make it a family restaurant if they want people to quietly sit and eat their food and not complain about poor service."
1,"They have really good Filipino food.\n\nLike most Filipino restaurants, it's all about the food.  Don't expect any scenery.\n\nI come here for a desert called \""halo halo\"".  Order one, mix it up, and enjoy it on a hot summer day."
1,"The entrees were dissapointing. The soups, salads and other sides that I tried were good. I have been to Bouchon 3 or 4 times, I live in LV so we came for my birthday.\n\nDo not get the gnocchi, you will be so sadly disappointed. It ruined my night, I feel like I want to cry about it, but I was too shy to say anything and embarrass the guy I was with. They're not soft at all, extremely dry when I had them. They do not taste handmade. DO NOT ORDER the gnocchi, the only thing good about them was the goat cheese on top. I hope I can at least help someone else not make the same mistake I did...\n\nThe lamb steak was delicious but very tough and not pleasant to chew, it came rare.\n\nThe pistachio ice cream is very unique and very very good.\n\nOur waiter was great though :)\n\nI gave the restaurant 4 instead of 3 stars because I don't like to make their ratings go down."
1,"Above-average United Club, 3rd Level, Terminal 3.\n\nPluses: \n* Open almost 24 hours:  4:30 to after midnight to serve the Red Eye flights\n* Friendly, helpful staff including Front Desk and Bartenders\n* Clean, modern facility with comfortable seating and abundant A/C outlets\n* Even serves bourbon as well-drink...missing in most United Clubs\n\nNegatives:  A Modest Suggestion...United would do well to study Lufthansa Lounges how to set up and operate a true hospitality lounge."
0,"I was feeling like complete garbage when we went to go see this exhibit.  I had already been once, in the early 2000's, so it was mainly for the boyfriend's benefit.  I was feeling nauseous, weak with hunger but too nauseous to eat, and sunstroked.  \n\nI did manage to take note of a few things while struggling to not barf my breakfast from Bouchon Bakery into the dolphin pool...  A.)  This place is still a ripoff.  Fifteen bucks for maybe five or six animal cages and three bored-looking dolphins?  B.)  They have misted walkways and plenty of places to sit, which the hungover, elderly and those burderned by screaming brats will appreciate.  I know I did.  C.)  The dude who forced us to take a picture was a douche.  D)  Wtf... what are these, llamas?  What the hell happened to the elephant?  \n\nand finally, E.)  I was dehydrated as fuck, so I opted for a Slush, which I interpreted to be a Slurpee of some sort, as indicated by the Slurpee machine it was dispensed out of.  Three dollars later, and the woman just hands me a tiny, McDonald's-sized-small styrofoam cup with red slurpee in it.  I search and search, but no straws.  I inquire where the straws are as she is serving someone else.  \""We don't have straws,\"" she says rather sharply.  \""Um, how do I drink this, then?\"" I ask back in the same tone, annoyed.  She sighs and jams her thumb in the direction of some little flat wooden spoons, the kind you'd eat a frosted malt with.  Are you fucking kidding me, Secret Garden - I'm supposed to eat a half-melted red slurpee that I payed a fifth of the admission for with a flat wooden friggin spoon?  SPRING FOR SOME STRAWS!!!"
0,"Like many others, I thought this place would a great addition to the plaza. \nI was wrong. To begin with, the service was poor. Our waiter was bussing tables\nand then serving others without washing his hands. However, we got lucky as the\nchef(cook) delivered our food as the waiter had disappeared for a few minutes.\nWe could see our order on the rack behind the glass, but the chef(cook) realized\nthe waiter wasn't there so he delivered it himself.\n   OK, on to the food. We ordered a meatball sandwich(11.00) and a child's portion \nof spaghetti with a meatball(7.00). My gf and I wanted to try what should be signature dishes.\nThe meatballs were ok. However, The bread did not appear homemade. \nAn Italian restaurant should never use packaged rolls. Also, the sauce was very\nsweet and tasted like it may have been at least partially, from a can. \nThe sauce certainly DID NOT have that \""made from scratch\"" taste and texture.\nThere are some great Italian places close to here that offer MUCH better food."
1,"psssst.... c'mere...... let me let you in on something kinda cool.  Medizona might be the best restaurant you've never heard of.  I mean, really, how is this place not huge?!   I don't have the descriptors to let you know how much I like this place.  \n\nThe food here is creative, attractively presented and fantastic on the palate.  It's southwestern and mediterrenean.  Yeah, \""huh?\""  I know.  I had the same reaction.  It's like Chino Bandido, it doesn't make sense, it doesn't sound like it'd work, but it does.  Go try it for yourself.   Ratatouille quesadilla.  Chorizo potato cake.  Lamb with a moussaka tart with red pepper sauce. And, of course, the prickly pear tiramisu.\n\nGo. \n\nTonight."
1,"Stopped by here when I was craving some Korean BBQ. This place had decent AYCE Korean BBQ with a huge selection of cuts and meats. We had kalbi (one of my fav things to eat), pork belly, and short ribs. But the best part of the night might have been this corn dish that our server made for us. It was corn, mayonnaise and maybe cheese? and it was f-ing fantastic. The servers were fantastic as well. I'm pretty helpless in the cooking department (even in making KBBQ!) and they came around and cleaned our grills, flipped our meats and made sure we had enough of everything. This was a great place for Korean BBQ. Definitely will come back!"

0,"I was shockingly \""impressed\"" with the room. It wasn't anything spectacular but after the reviews I had read online, prior to my visit, I was a little nervous. The one thing that did annoy me was that I booked through my airline as a package deal, upon arriving the hotel clerk told me I owed another $85 for the resort fees since they weren't charged in the package deal. Had I known this, for the price I paid, I could have stayed at a nicer hotel on the strip somewhere.\n\nWhen I got there the light in the bathroom was burnt out but there was a maintenance guy knocking on our door 20 minutes later. Apparently the maid had put in a ticket for service.\n\nThe bathroom is my biggest complaint. It smelled like mildew and was not clean at all. I felt like I was still dirty after showering. The shower curtain was ripped and the drain was disgustingly rusty. Surprisingly, the toilet was pretty clean but it didn't flush very well. Additionally, the water pressure in the shower sucked! It took me 20 min to rinse my hair because the stream was so weak.\n\nThe room layout was spacious and even had a very decent sized desk for me to work while on vacation. The bed sheets were (to my knowledge) clean enough. I was afraid to inspect them much more.\n\nThe staff was friendly and moved us to a \""nicer\"" room when we arrived because he said our room was one of the oldest ones they had. Its a $20 up-charge for a renovated room.. FYI."
1,"So far, I've only had positive experiences at this Panera. Their Fuji Apple Chicken Salad is better than most other Panera locations... their baked goods, however, leave something to be desired. Why would you put chocolate sprinkles on a chocolate croissant? It's not a doughnut!\n\nAnyhow, I do like how low-key this location is... the one by Waterfront is way too crowded and hectic."
1,"Good service. The daughter works the front and she is nice and works hard to make sure the restaurant runs well and is clean. \nThe food is really good for AZ/MEX. Cheap. Carne Asada burrito is very good. Also, the beans are authentic. One of the best breakfast burritos around. \nNow, some people knock the location and decor. Well, I don't eat either one so I'l leave that to other raters ( my friends say I can eat a lounge chair in less than a minute). \nNice people and quick to get your order out. Recommended by this mexican food aficionado."
1,"First time wife and I have had AYCE at a sushi restaurant and it was quite a treat. The fact their price is only $24/person makes it that much better. Overall the food was very good and well prepared not cheap/slop as one would expect. The service is super fast and plenty of wait staff around to help all the time. It was Fri night at 10pm and it was packed. The sushi was fresh and clean tasting and the rice was not overstuffed which showed they were not trying to fill you up on rice.......very impressive. We had a few exotic rolls with interesting sauces and each was unique and distinct. The deep fried soft shell crab appetizer was surprisingly good for such an inexpensive restaurant. The hamachi kama was the only dish that was literally ruined by over cooking it. I have had the real thing (large cuts off the head/shoulder) in Japan and Hong Kong for years and the way it should be is barely cooked over an open flame which draws out all of the oil and makes the fish super moist and melts in your mouth. This was dry and therefore almost tasteless compared to the real thing.\n\nBut the truly amazing standout at this restaurant is clearly the seafood salad. We started out with one and devoured it in joy. The dressing is very spicy so be careful......but it was bursting with flavor. What they do (in my opinion) is use the end cuttings from the sashimi plus 2 pieces of tempura shrimp for the ingredients. Amazing, pieces of every kind of fish and scallops and all melted in your mouth. Even the odd cut pieces of salmon were smooth as silk. When they asked for last orders we were pretty stuffed so decided on one more of the seafood salad (one allowed for each diner) but when it came out we were blown away.....it had twice as much fish as the first order.....it was absurd, had to have at least 25 pieces of fish/scallops....we could not even finish it and had to waddle out the front door because of it. Here's the thing: if you eat sushi in any form it is filled with rice, the menu does not offer sashimi for this reason: most would order it over sushi so as not to fill up. Well this dish is all sashimi and then some...........you can eat great fish and not get overly filled up to leave room for some of the great appetizers.\n\nWill be back next time we are in Vegas."
1,Probably the best mushrooms I've ever had.  Beef was nice.  Service a little slow but ambiance was great.
0,"Sushi was very average. Ordered the snow roll and crazy tuna roll, both bland and rice tasted stale. Companion had hibachi which came out cold. Also ordered avocado sashimi, which hilariously was a sliced avocado w dipping sauce. Why even offer this? Hostess was rude, and waiter was incompetent (though pleasant), such as asking us if we wanted dessert when we hadn't even finished eating our main course. Would not bother to visit again."
1,"How nice is it to have a Lee's right by your house?  Decent selection of wine but unfortunately did not agree with the local reviews.  We tried a few bottles based on store reviews and were pretty disappointed.  Having said that, the Easter location is clean and convenient with a nice variety.  So, if we know what we're looking for or following more well-known reviews we're quite happy."
0,"Came here late on a Saturday night with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday. Was so packed that most of our party had to stand, could barely move, and couldn't hear each other. The waitress was not very friendly and the drinks were not that great. My friend paid for me so I am not sure what the drink prices were like. Hubby also said he saw a few people actually smoking inside. Isn't there an ordinance for that? Needless to say, not my kind of place so we had 1 drink, paid, and went next door to San Tan Brewery. If you like loud, overly crowded bars with bad service, then maybe this is your place."
1,"The Chip is my favorite place to be on a Friday night. \nBe prepared for an old style country bar! Dancing, bull riding, fire pits and BBQ!"
0,"The food here is below average for the prices. I ordered the chicken strips and fries and they feel way short of impressive. I was just looking for a quick casual lunch to eat by myself while waiting for some friends. \n\nThe chicken and strips came out to be about $14 for about 4 strips and fries. I should have just gotten a burger from I Love Burgers upstairs. I was really disappointed with my chicken strips and felt way jipped because they were barely chicken strips and looked more like thick chicken fries!! It would had been better if it was actual strips! The 4 chicken strips probably equated to one NORMAL sized strip! if I paid like $5, then I wouldn't be so upset, but for $14, it's soooooo not worth it! \n\nWhen my friend arrived, she got chicken strips from the food court upstairs in the shopping... half the price, more food, and it tasted better! If they can't get simple chicken strips correct, I don't want to try anything else!"
1,"One of my most favorite places in the world is Venice. So of course, the Venetian Casino is one of my all time favorite places to be at here in Vegas! I just spent the last two hours roaming the canal shoppes, and savoring the wonderful food. All the thrills of Venice, \""without the smell & flocking birds\""!"
0,"Came for the $99 x 2 as a party of four\n\nChowder - good but not remarkable\nSalad - awful, drenched in vinegar\n18oz Ribeye - tasty but lots of gristle and fat, not a nice texture\n40oz Porterhouse - outside cuts tasty but mostly bland\nApple crumble - good\nCheesecake - awful, like it was defrosted\nAtmosphere - poor, more like a sports bar than a steakhouse\nService - just OK"
1,"I was a little skeptical of a bar that was on the 2nd floor above a Starbucks to be honest. I read a couple reviews on here and thought I would give it a shot when I was on my way home early from work. To my surprise this place was amazing, don't let the location fool you. The layout and feeling of the bar makes it seem like it doesn't belong in AZ. Almost like you were instantly transported to LA or NYC. \n\nI've been back a couple of times to this place and the bartenders have been great every time and definitely know what they are doing. When you order a drink, you are getting a cocktail, not a liquor and random mixer splashed together in a cup. They have specialty drinks and if you're going to order something fancy, you better know what you are want. Had my first Manhattan here (cause I was feeling fancy) and they had no problem making it, from memory. I don't know of any other bar would be able to say the same. \n\nBecause of the drinks (turns out Manhattans are mostly booze... and delicious) I don't really remember the type of music they were playing. I do remember that we didn't have to yell over it to talk so that's a plus."
1,Really really great service.  Diverse menu.  Apps are excellent especially the calamari  which features some interesting use of lime.  Nice atmosphere.
0,BLAND!!! No flavor in anything. Don't waste the walk from your car inside. I've had better Mexican at Taco Bell. The best part of the meal was my diet soda. After our plates were cleared it took over 20 mins for the waiter to bring our check. Not recommend AT ALL!
0,"I have had bad, bad experiences in Belushi's!\n\nIt's a total dive.....I know but I have to mention the elephant in the room, it's really not nice. It makes up in cheap drinks and great banter what it lacks in surrounding and cleanliness. But at the end of the day, if you're looking for a cheap and fun night out then you can't go wrong.\nBelushi's is amongst a handful of places you can get wasted in relatively cheaply. It serves it purpose well...but is definitely not for me!"
0,My chicken pot pie not very good at all. the crust was soft and soggy and the pie was more like a soup. the flavor was terrible\nThe Shepherds pie was better.\nThe place is a nice and has a nice outdoor patio
1,"First off they did a great job on the interior design of this place. Very modern and hip. However, I hear the bathroom needsd to be updated badly. \n\nMy friend and I were promptly seated and asked what we wanted for our drink orders. We just got water with lemon. They were not super attentive to refilling our water which was noticeable because I ordered Thai Hot spicyness with my dish. \n\nFor starters we ordered the fried tofu which came with a very nice tangy, spicy sauce. The texture of the tofu was just perfect, being crisp on the outside but not too crisp. My friend ordered summer rolls which were very good, a little rubbery in their texture with the wrap they used which was a rice wrap I believe but it was still very good. \n\nI am a huge fan of Tom Khai in the form of soup so I very intrigued when I saw an entree of it served with rice instead. I ordered it with tofu and it was very good. It was Thai hot just the way I liked and had plenty of tofu, mixed in with vegetables. \n\nOverall our service was great minus the water not being refilled but I can overlook that. They were somewhat busy and there were only two people working. For less than $20 you can't beat it. And the starters were only $5 dollars a menu item for the rolls and tofu. This is my new favorite Thai place downtoown!"
0,"Used to be good but not now. New manager as of Aug. 14   Disrespectful, back talking and unhappy that he has to work. And a bad attitude to boot"
1,"I'm in love with this adorable little shop! It's PERFECT! Something for everyone, you'll never leave empty-handed! The owners are warm and friendly and so helpful!"
1,"I love this little place right in Market Square. I had the eggplant pram which was a whopping portion if delish. Friendly service and a feast little patio made for a lovely, if very filling, lunch"
0,"We went here for an Oktoberfest today after having purchased a coupon deal for admission and beverages (4 beers per person).  The place was easy to locate in Old Town Scottsdale, and on-street parking was readily available nearby.\n\nPros:\n\nSurprisingly, this was an indoor venue instead of outdoor, and it seemed more like a large beer hall with lots of old world decor, which took some of the disappointment out of being confined indoors on such a beautiful day.\n\nStaff were generally pretty friendly and helpful, seating was plentiful, the oompa band (3 local musicians) was entertaining and fun, and the craft beer (especially the Oktoberfest Lager) was very nice.\n\nCons:\n\nIn spite of having a printed (and web published) schedule of activities, the stage crew & management seemed genuinely confused as to the order of things.  When the band went on break, the sound team played loud rock music from some radio station over the PA system, rather then anything remotely themed to the event.\n\nFood offerings were meager (brats $7, soft pretzels $4, small bags of potato chips, etc).  The brats were served in a sliced, hard baguette with choice of grilled onions and/or sauerkraut, but were dry and somewhat flavorless.  In addition, there was only regular, yellow mustard available at the counter.  No spicy or German style mustard was available, but one of the staff did manage to scrounge up a small bowl of Dijon after I asked.  No other accompaniments were available, such as potato salad or fries, nor were there any desserts on offer.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this event at about a \""2\"", mainly because of the disorganization and poor quality of food offerings."
1,"I really didn't want to like this place.  I guess it was an anti white-guy-owning-tequila-company thing.  BUT it's pretty good and good on him I guess. Wife and I stopped in to get a quick bite/drink before seeing a show. We shared the queso dip and chips, dos ceviches, and mexican tossed salad. Queso dip - ok. Dos ceviches - amazing. Some shrimp ceviche and some chipotle tuna tartar. It was REALLY good. Like enough to tell people about and \""go back for\"" good. The salad - surprisingly good. Very simply dressed, cilantro and corn included. Very good. Overall, pretty good. Even better if you can get a seat out on the patio for some people watching."
0,"We came to see the mermaids last Sunday and noticed a sign out front stating that the mermaid show had been canceled for the day.  A bit disappointing considering the show only goes on certain days and that was the only day we were there that they were scheduled.  \n\nThe aquarium itself isn't enough to justify the trip away from the strip.  If you are going to see the mermaids, I would call beforehand to verify that the show isn't canceled."
0,"It is bad in every way possible. We called and asked if they were busy and they hung up,  VERY expensive for low quality food, half the orders came out after everyone else was done eating, the salad was literally half a cup of chopped lettuce..."
1,Just signed up our 2 year old daughter and she loves it :)
1,"If you want a nice slice, this is where to go.  We've been many times and everything has always been great. Order your slices, find a spot and do the old lean and eat.  Can't beat the convenience.  Wed night not very busy, Saturday afternoon in the middle of summer, there is a line down the hall.  But hay, that's when the people watching gets good.  Would I go back?  Absolutely!"
1,"Decided to try a new place ,so we came here. We're seated and waited on quickly. Ordered two patron margaritas and cheesy crisp with green chile. Salsa and chile very mild but not bad. I ordered burro favorito carnitas red enchilada style. My wife had combo platter. Besides the mild chili it was awesome great flavor and good size plate. My wife loved the combo platter and these bite size what I can only explain as a ball were great tasting had oozing cheese and pieces of green chili fried in a crust. And our server Patrick was the best server we have had at any restaurant we have been to. Friendly, attentive, and alway\nMade sure we liked everything and that we were doing good. So if you come here you might want to look for this guy. Great customer service."
0,"OMg this place is so dirty now.  I can't even tell the design of the carpet as it is now just cakes in old grease.  They used to have good Chinese BBQ but now that is expensive, burnt, and the butchers give the worst pieces of meat.  They make you buy a minimum of one pound and don't even give you the piece you ask for.  If you want a pound , they give you 2 pounds.  Diner beware."
1,"Service was great, menu looked new , food came out fast and fresh . Very good portions . Was good improvement since I visited years ago ."
0,"So the service was bad. I must admit I really liked what I ordered however my boyfriend was extremely displeased with the quality of his meal. First time we've been to this place, probably won't be back. From what I've read the only thing that sounds good is their bar."
0,"Came here with high expectations after going to Drai's the day before and having a blast. To be honest, I was a little underwhelmed. I felt like the energy just wasn't as high at Encore and it was more like fancy hotel pool instead of a pool party. A lot of the girls here are super fake (a few friends and I actually made a game of pointing out all the fake boobs), but some people are into that so to each their own. I wish there were more dancing areas with ankle deep water so you didn't either bake or turn all pruney. Drinks are expensive as usual - going rate is about $19. \n\nPros: \n-Good music. \n-Good looking guys and gals. \n-Poolside couches/cabanas are well placed (though absurdly priced.) \n-Large pool space.\n-Decently priced lockers. \n\nCons: \n-No shade (you will buuuuurn) in the pool. \n-There is NO splashing. Security is 100% on top of that. \n-ABSOLUTELY NO dudes on that middle dance area with the stripper poles. You will be bounced in under 15 seconds guaranteed. And leads me to another point. \n-Security are Nazis here. \n-Water costs $11 (so ask for a glass of ice instead). \n-Sunscreen costs $30\n-Pool water gets really gross really fast. The water was murky when we left after 2 hours. Also there was an assortment of floating straws, cups, and bottles. Ew."
0,"2.5 . I decided to stay in Vegas after the EDC weekend and a good friend of mine wanted to check out Fremont street. We hop on the bus and get off. Our original destination of insert coins was closed. After walking a bit I saw Park On Fremont and decided to check it out from the happy hour board outside. We were seated in the back. It wasn't that busy of a night and it took over 20 minutes for our server to even acknowledge us and give us water. \n\nI look over the happy hour menu and ask a few questions. Turns out the drinks for happy hour are NOT the same size as the regular counterparts in the menu. Same goes for the food choices. \n\nThe food was tasty, saving this experience. I had the Philly cheese steak and a friend had the sliders which were good as well. The drinks were tasty, but I don't know if they are 10 dollar craft cocktail tasty. After we were done eating , the waitress apologizes and gives us 2 of the 5$ special drinks for the trouble. Nice gesture, but the damage was done. \n\nAll in all, service was lacking majorly and just not a \""I want to be at work\"" vibe from the staff. Almost a point for the see saw in the secret back area though."
0,"The staff here was very friendly and extremely nice.  However, I brought a ring in to be sized of which the jeweler in the back said he could do there.  When he was done I noticed the stone was now loose. I pointed it out and they said they couldn't fix it there they would have to send it to the main location.  I wanted to wear the ring so I kept it.  Then I realized a week later looking at the ring close up because the stone was loose, that the stone actually had a chip in it.  This was not there when I originally brought it in.  I was very upset.  Not only was the stone loose now in the ring, but there was a chip in the stone as well.  Not happy."
1,"I found White Rock through my work, and have never been feeling better or happier.  First, their approach is much more holistic than many chiropractors I have been too.  Stretching, adjustment and trigger point massage work together to realign your spine.  Secondly, Dr. Bryson always takes time to make sure that she's covered everything that's bothering me.  About the only drawback is their hours, but since I work an off schedule, for most people it's not an issue."
1,"My buddies back in California have been telling me for sometime about this joint called Farmer Boys.  They keep saying how great it is and as a fast food connoisseur, it was definitely on my list the next time I made it back there.  Well much like finding a five dollar bill in the pocket of your jeans, I was driving down Decatur in part of town I rarely roll to and lo and behold, there was a Farmer Boys staring me in the face.  Waiting was no longer needed.....it was go time!\n\nThe place was epically busy during lunch, which is a good sign.  I ordered the Farmer Burger which is a half pound burger with cheese, bacon and avocado (got to go with the namesake) and made it a combo.  I duly paid up and when the transaction was complete I asked for my cup for a soda, the gentleman taking the order was like \""Oh you wanted a combo, I didnt ring it up as such.\""  I said no problemo, I'll pay the difference, but he was insistent that it was his fault and that he'd take care of it.  I felt bad and wanted to pay but he wouldn't let me so I put what it would cost me into the tip jar.  I thought that was a nice, albeit really unnecessary, customer service gesture.  Not something you see too often in quick service restaurants anymore which made it all the more refreshing.\n\nAs for the food, the burger was outstanding.  One of the better fast food burgers I have ever had.  The bacon was crisp, the patty was large and full of flavor and the cheese was thick but not overwhelming.  I struggled to finish the whole thing, which is a rare occurrence.  The fries were good but relatively unspectacular.  I wish the fries were top notch because I would not hesitate to give Farmer Boys a 5 star ranking in that case.  Although, there is hope.  The menu is extensive and I have barely scratched the surface with this matinee performance.  When I make my return, there is a pretty comprehensive looking breakfast menu which is served all day (awesome!) and intriguing salad and wrap options too.  So basically this 4 star ranking serves as my opening salvo, while further visits will reveal the true nature of this place. \n\nPrices were decent, especially considering the quality of the ingredients.  Service was friendly and the dining atmosphere was kitschy, rustic, farmy fun.  I also respect that they rock the drive-thru as well so if that REO Speedwagon song I'm rocking too is just to good to turn off, I can keep the party going without missing a beat.  Now if I can only figure out more reasons to go to this stretch of Decatur....."
0,"What a disappointment...the most over-priced, terrible dining experience I've had in Charlotte. Took 15 minutes to have drink orders taken. After that, the poor performance continued. The calamari was way over-salted!!! Awful. The sushi was sub-par at best. The fish was pretty fresh, but the rolls were simplistic and lacked flavor. Considering the specialty rolls range from 10-22 dollars, I expected a lot more. Ru San's is a much better choice if you are looking for sushi. The only good thing about the meal was that our waiter had the calamari removed from the bill because he agreed that it was way too salty as he had seen the chef season it. Even with that off the bill, way over-priced! Save yourself the time and do not dine here. The staff and customers at Enso are too worried about being hip to provide a decent experience."
0,"Well, we were trying to find \""cheese dip\"" in Vegas.  Some kind of Tex-Mex.  We found it.  Let me tell you, that was the best thing about this place.  The cheese dip was actually pretty good and a very ample serving.  Chips were thin, crispy and not too salty.  We really liked it until the entrees came.  Ugh!!  Pork tamales tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in them.  Pork taco was cold and pretty light on the meat.  The cheese enchiladas were, um, cheesy.  That's about it.  Not much taste at all.  Refried beans were smoky and not horrible.  But the rice, was the worst Mexican/Spanish rice I have ever put in my mouth.  Terrible!!  The only reason this place doesn't get one star is because our server, Boone, was awesome.  It's not his fault the food stank.  I would not go there again, unless I was just wanting cheese dip and no entrees.  If you're looking for Mexican OR Tex-Mex, you can do a LOT better."
0,"We came here based on Yelp reviews, and the fact that we were staying at the Bellagio resort. We made a reservation with the concierge and were accomodated for an 8:30 sitting. We were escorted to the table and thought the room looked nice albeit dark. We sat down and started to chat but could hardly hear each other. The restaurant was very busy and the noise was down to the full house as well as the hard walls and tile floor. The hostess gave us two menus and an ipad. No explanation but basically figured the ipad was the wine list and menu pics etc. the server checked in and asked if we would like to start with some wine, I said that we werent sure what we were going to eat so would need some time before our wine choice. BIG MISTAKE, at least 20 minutes passed before we saw him again, we were on minute three of our 5 minute countdown to walking out. We ordered the carpaccio, the mushroom tagliatelle and the gnocci and a bottle of Layer Cake. The carpaccio arrived and it was as advertised, delicious. We also got some tappenade but I just don't get the white chocolate scone as an accompanyment. We again waited for what seemed a very long time for the remnants of the carpaccio to be taken away. And then we waited, and waited. the table next to us who came in while we were ordering recieved their appy and entree and were deciding about desert while our server announced that the kitchen would be plating our pasta momentarily. I would have complained directly to this guy but he was a ghost. A different person was continually dropping off our food or refilling our water. Once the pasta arrived , the gnocci was fine, nothing special, and the mushroom pasta was well over cooked, mushy and stuck together, at the quality check we actually mentioned that its was just Ok, but no reaction. Bottome line? don't bother"
1,"Pretty good Chinese place for Vegas. We wanted to get an inexpensive but good meal and decided to give this place a try. It's located right in the middle of the casino, which was interesting. Saw lots of Asian patrons so that made me feel better! Haha\n\nFood comes out super fast.  Ordered the curry noodles with bbq pork and shrimp, it was DELICIOUS! Portion size was good for $13 bucks. Also ordered a glass of chardonnay for $7. My friend got a beer and the crispy pan fried noodles.  Overall a great place for a quick bite that won't break your wallet."
1,"Had some late afternoon meetings here this week and enjoyed the place.\n\nIt could use a bike rack, which actually isn't a quibble any more.\n\nHad a baked brie-based appetizer one day and shared an antipasto the next.  Roasted peppers and sun dried tomatos - delicious.  Breads - very good.  Pesto - rich.  Service - attentive, allowed us to linger for hours during the 'tween time.\n\nAnother non-quibble - the coffee is boring.\n\nOverall Carlys deserves fan-hood based on these two experiences."
0,Fair play to the owner who contacted me to make things right the next time I visit. With that kind of attention to customer experience I am sure this place will succeed.
1,Never suggested unnecessary treatment.  Always on time.  Friendly and comfortable.  Highly recommend.
1,"Since my first visit a year ago, I've been dreaming about my return to BurGR. I'm happy to say the burger was absolutely amazing and just as good as I remembered. \n\nHere's what you need to know: \n\nLine: there will be a wait. Get over it. Is amazing. Put your name on the list and hang around in Planet Hollywood. They'll text you when your seat is ready. \n\nFood: get a burger. Any burger will do, but the Hell's Kitchen burger and the farm burger are amazing. The farm has duck bacon and a perfectly cooked egg. \n\nService: it can be slow, but it's usually because they are so busy. They keep the drinks full, but just like any other Vegas restaurant they don't like to split checks. \n\nJust as with any other Harrahs property, show your total rewards card to save a bit of money. \n\nGo. Eat a burger. Enjoy the deliciousness."
1,"Surprise was definitely the prettiest stop along our Spring Training tour this year. Parking was free.  The ticket lines (despite having 9 functioning windows) were slow.  Luckily we got to the window to find out they had just opened up seats right behind home plate for only $22!   I was however, completely turned around by entering from the ticket windows to the outflield.  \n\nThis stadium is still crisp and clean and have the most seats in the shade out of the three we visited.  We are definitely ready for the season to begin!"
1,"Great drinks, quick service, perfect on those hot days on the Strip!\nWe were hooked on to the drinks here during our stay in Vegas.....this should be officially made another of those must-visit locations on the Strip! :D"
0,"Groomer does a great job but their prices are so inconsistent. I used to get charged $40 per dog then it went up to $45 then now, they just tried charging me $50 - this in a matter of 6 months!  RIDICULOUS!!!"
1,"GET SOME!!\ngo now seriously and get some.\n\nThis place is easily now my top favorite mexican food joint in all of phoenix. Great cheap prices. There are three types of mexican restaurant places i go. 1) I have to for some reason. 2) I want some mexican food and this place was around. and 3) I crave this place in particular.\n\nThis place falls into my number 3 category easily. I literally love the guy at the register, he was really friendly and knew his menu well. That is always a good thing when your workers actually know the menu (i think he might be the owner). It is a small place, outdoor seating if you wish and pretty clean considering the outside aesthetics. \n\nThe food:\n\nFish Tacos - Grade: A+, the fish was fresh and crunchy, the sauce was nice and tangy, the cabbage was crisp and fresh. The sauce and the lime were in perfect harmony.\n\nQuesadilla -  Grade: A+crunchy corn tortilla, um for real, soo simple yet soo delicious, crunchy all the way through, generous amounts of cheese made each bite memorable\n\nTamales (spicy chicken) - Grade:  A, i wish the maiz was a little softer, but the texture was still good. I was hoping for the chicken to be spicier but i have a pallet for spicy pain... Even though it didn't get a plus it was still really good, just wasn't what i was expecting so a slight let down\n\nPerro Oaxaca - Grade: A, the Oaxacan version of the Sonoran Hot Dog...still my votes go sonoran all the way through and through. This was REALLLY tasty still, but my only step fuss was, too much mayo on it, if it was SPICY mayo i wouldn't mind too much...\nMy opinion for the mayo is, either do light mayo, or do a chipotle mayo and put that one top...that would be great.\n\n\nGlad i have found a mexican food joint i love on my side of town. I'll be back in a week when i start to crave it again."
1,"Who doesn't like ice cream?  \n\nThe best part about staying on the 'other' side of vegas in the California hotel was stumbling upon the ice cream shop.  I must have squealed that I did not know Lapperts was here!!!\n\nAnyway, doesn't matter if you're too full from your meal or too drunk, stumble in and let your taste buds rejoice."
0,"The staff is very friendly and the location is in a great spot; however, the whole concept is a little confusing to me because the great part of Walmart is having everything I need in one place. This place, is the exact opposite. It's a small local location that doesn't offer everything a true full-size Walmart has. If I want something smaller, I'm going to go to a mom-and-pop boutique not a smaller Walmart."
1,Vegas bail helped me out huge.  They took care of all my questions.  I would highly recommend them if you need a Bail Bonds.  Call Vegas Bail.
0,"I am forced to give this dining experience one star since no stars or negative rating is not an option. Besides the poorly attentive, or lack there of, wait staff, the food was deplorable from cold potato skins to horrible & incorrect sandwiches. It took forever to even get the bill or table cleared. This restaurant would be better served as a parking lot for the better surrounding establishments"

1,"I ordered a Game of Thrones card expansion from them since the don't sell them that much anywhere else. To  my surprise, when I went to pick it up, they had all the other house expansions as well. I bought them all in one day! This place knows how to take care of their customers' needs lol."
0,"It is very rare that I give 1 star reviews, but this one takes the cake.  Before calling this place I looked over the lunch special menu, on the top of the  menu there were these two words that I hate!! \""NO Substitutions\"". I looked all over the menu for the combo that I usually get, but for some reason they did not have it.  I made my call over to this place and I was about to place a nice sized order for my staff and I.  I asked the gentleman, who I felt was rushing me, If I could get tonkatsu instead of chicken katsu with beef terri, the gentleman said that they \""Do not offer this combo under the LUNCH SPECIAL at all\""  OK understood.  I then asked him,  okay well I don't want the lunch special, would I be able to get one plate of beef terri and a side of tonkatsu.  The gentleman replied, NO, I can not do that.  I asked him why, he said that it was too expensive to do it like that.  I asked him how much would it cost for me to get this, he chuckled and said like $30-$40 for the plate for doing this.  I WAS appalled by this response.  One, how do you know what I can and can not afford.  Two, your a restaurant and you should accommodate your customers.  Three, there is more then just your Japanese restaurant out there.  Four, provide people with alternatives or options instead of just saying NO!!!  I will not recommend this place to anyone!  Your money is well spent at Papa Johns right next door instead of this place!"
1,"This is the ONLY service that I have had a great experience with since moving to Vegas four months ago. Roy the plumber is awesome. I've used him twice. Soooo nice and he goes above and beyond.\nUpdate-\nSo now my air conditioning decided the day it was 102 degrees to stop working.  Jeremy came to the rescue and now my house is polar again. I had called after hours (someone is always there as they answer 24/7) and he said first appt. was Friday. This was Tuesday, so I cried like a 40 year old baby and they fit me in the very next day. THANK GOD.  This company is the best. I wish they did more things!"
1,"Spring training in Phoenix resulted in huge crowds and sky high rental car prices.\n\nEnterprise and its competitors were overwhelmed.  The staff did it's best to keep up.  I used my loyalty card to get to the rental desk without a line, but then still had to wait 10-15 minutes when I went downstairs where the cars are for an agent to show me a car and get the final signatures.\n\nMy standard for top-flight Enterprise service is Atlanta/Hartsfield. If ATL is 5 stars, Phoenix is four.\n\nNote:  All the companies share one facility and use a common shuttle bus.    The rental car return was easy to find. There were loads of signs once you got near the place."
0,"I give it 2 stars because the taters tots are PHENOMENAL (sweet tater tots-Righteous!)..other than that, really, what would draw you there? A bar that used to have personality & individuality as COMMON HOUSE now has absolutely ZERO.\n Its a chain bar/restaurant that promotes itself as nothing but that, in a neighborhood/area that celebrates uniqueness; what could you get there besides a few menu items you can't get 100 other bars in charlotte?\n\n I also agree w/some other posters that w/all the chotskies and damn bicycles everywhere, it does seem to want to draw the REALLY young drinkers and be more of a Hooters/Boardwalk Billys/Vinnies type BAR than a bar/restaurant. \n\nPlus pair it up w/its sister rest. LOCO LIME (with its gentrified mexican fare thats on its best day \""mehhh..\"" ) and you have one big complex of bland ordinary-ness replacing what used to be a really great neighborhood place to go. WHATTTAA choice!: bland overpriced mexican food w/average service OR...burgers & fries w/fratboys....how about we start having peanuts at the tables we can throw everywhere while you're at it!!!!"
0,Service was poor. Waiter cleared table of food prior to finishing the meal. Waitress was non-existent and was somewhat rude. Waited over 10 mins for check and rarely saw her after she took my order. Took another 5 for her to pick up the check and return it for signature. \n\nOrdered the madras chicken which was good but very spicy. \n\nI'm guessing if Gordon was here tonight there would be a lot of profanity as the service wouldn't come close to meeting his high standards.
1,"The best car wash EVER!  When they say hand wash, it is hand wash.  No machines!!!  I spoke to the owner.  Very nice guy.  I told him this place will see me again and again.  Comfortable waiting area with wifi, flat screen and charging ports.  Prices are great.  Be sure to check in on Yelp when you get there for $2 off."
1,"They are actually open til 9pm. They were nice and when we went to pay at 9pm they said we could stay and continue to chat for a while longer because they \""would be there for awhile\"". Great food, excellent service. If anyone complains about this place then they probably think ihop and applebees are amazing. Go in, grab a table and enjoy yourself. Some people complain that they have to wait too long for service but lots of people actually enjoy talking to the company they are with and are there to relax, hence the \""cafe\"" part?Just because the cakes are labeled vegan doesnt mean they taste any less than DELICIOUS! Food isnt loaded with salt and other junk so if youre used to processed junk then a lot of the dishes will taste a little odd to you but if youre looking for a delicious meal, snack, smoothie, or dessert that is relatively healthy for eating out, this is the place. They also make dishes how you like them. You can have them with meat or vegetarian style or vegan style.\n\nas far as the reviewer is complaining about hidden calories in the peanut butter cookies. Have you heard of PB2 or powdered peanut butter? They probably use that. Theres lots of alternatives out there. Get the facts before making accusations (not to say that there couldnt be hidden calories though). Theres also products like powdered soy milk. Maybe they use that as well."
1,"Okay guys 20 mins for a spice ice tea and coffee when we tell you that we are in a hurry.  Tell us you cant do it.  Much better than leaving us hanging until we walk out.  So quick tip yelpers you must have time to visit Red Velvet, between a regular following and a mellow staff time can tick by."
1,"Great food, great people, and a very nice setting... Great \""get to know you\"" date spot.  The pizza is also amazing."
1,"This is a great bar.  I love the fact that you sit in an open circle providing ample opportunity to people watch the high end shoppers.  Good service and great selection of whiskey, bourbon, gin, and other yummy distilled treats."
1,"Only been to this one Thai place in Phoenix, but it's so goo I don't need to go anywhere else.  Great, friendly staff.  Have brought friends from out of town who have loved the food too. Glad to randomly find this place."
1,"My parents actually turned us onto this place (usually we're the ones to introduce them to new places). We went on a Sunday around 11, they were pretty packed but we were seated quickly enough. The place has a quaint, country charm vibe.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and after realizing how fast we go through iced tea and water he brought us adorable little pitchers! My Mom and I ordered the eggs benedict. I liked everything but the ham (I'm not big on ham to begin with though). I'm very picky about my poached eggs being cooked properly and can go all Gordon Ramsey if they're messed up. They were perfect! I really loved the hollandaise too.I forget what my Dad and hubby ordered but they loved theirs as well. \n\nWe'll definitely be going back here regularly!"
1,"best barbecue I've had since chicago .the brisket is phenomenal, and sweet coleslaw the way it should  be"
1,"Let me get this outta the way, I am in no way \""a FAN\"" of the DMV but as far as efficiency goes, 4 stars for sure!!! \n~I'm an organized individual, so I came prepared with all the appropriate documents to change my name, address and renew my license.....I think that makes it a thousand times easier.  Look online before you go; 90% of the questions you might have are probably answered for you.\n~I was in and out in less than 45 minutes......!  =)  \n~The staff was incredibly polite and gracious......many CONGRATS on my recent nuptials! \n~I easily could have given them 5 stars for this experience, but the \""information\"" line was poorly marked.  I found myself asking others waiting where exactly I was supposed to go.\n\n*Quick tips:\n1. PREPARATION is the key to success...I teach, I know this as FACT!\n2. Rainy days are apparently the best day to go!\n3. Reading material is a plus......catch up on school work or a trashy magazine.  Either way, make sure you have something to pass the time just in case.\n4. And lastly, I repeat, PLAN AHEAD...........how often do you show up somewhere having forgot to bring what you needed?"
1,5 Star customer service at all times.  The food is very delicious.  I like the Gemme and the chicken kabob is delish!  The hot tea of course perfect. Two Thumbs up!
1,"I love this place !  The food here is delicious, and very authentic Italian.  There is no skimping here when it come to the finest ingredients.  The pizza is cooked to perfection, with a really nice crust. The Egg Plant is to die for.  Prices are very reasonable too. The Owner Cosimo is really a great guy, does most of the cooking himself, but always finds the time to come and greet his guest.  The Manager Tanino is your host for the evening, He will take excellent care of you, never have to ask for anything from him, he hast it all covered, and never leaves your glass empty.  He makes it a point to remember your name, and will greet you by that on your next visit guaranteed. The Restaurant itself is immaculate, and comfortable with an \""Old World\"" charm.   Try this place once, and you'll never eat Italian anywhere else!"
0,"It's one of the Sprint Stores that has technicians on site when your phone is having a problem.  That's nice.  Too bad every time you see a technician at a Sprint Store, they seem to always have the same solution.  Reboot the phone.  It's like a bad IT department.  I lost my phone for 90 minutes to do something I could've done on my own.  The technician was kind enough to backup my contacts on the memory card, but didn't take the time to put them back on the phone.\n\nIt actually appears the problem was my charger, not the phone, so was the reboot even necessary?  Also, If you don't have Sprint's insurance, you may have to pay for any repairs even if the phone is under warranty.  You have to deal with the manufacturer if it's under warranty.  Thanks for standing by your products, Sprint."
0,"The single most disgusting sushi experience I've ever had. Asian nachos were burned and tasteless, April and Toosties rolls were totally bland and the texture was way off, the crab wontons came with some funky nasty sauce.. Blahhhh. $50 down the toilet."
1,"Incredible! Everything is great there! The ambiance, the food, the service. It is all first class. Just sad that they aren't open year round as its a place I could every week! I highly recommend this as a first date spot, anniversary spot, or just taking business colleagues out."
1,"Great beer selection, especially the beer fusions. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, quick service. Food is typical bar food, nothing special but didn't agree with my girlfriends stomach in the least. So four stars for the beer and atmosphere but wouldn't eat here."
0,"I went yesterday. Have to say this place has the worst food ever!! When asked about a refund they stated they do lot do refunds. The roll was a typical Philly, not sure how hard that is. They have us credit however there is nothing at this place I would eat. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!"
1,"Now that I'm living in AZ full time, I need to hit Dilly's as often as I can. The sandwiches and wraps are still great! The Poore Bros chips are still fantastic. I'm a big fan of the BBQ Ranch flavor. I never stray from the goodness of these flavor of chips.\n\nMy favorites sandwiches are the humdinger, dilly club and then the mexi, southwest and chicken cesar wraps\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of the sandwich choices on the menu. The cookies are very tasty!\n\nAll sandwiches and wraps are $6.99 and come with your choice of a side and a pickle spear.\n\nDuring the peak lunch hour, you wait in line a bit or struggle to find a table to sit.. Order usually come out within 5-10 minutes during peak time."
0,Because of this NNY I will never eat at another one. I wish I could leave no stars. I got served a hamburger with Brillo pad cooked in it. Then they only gave me 1/2 off the cost of my bill. Worthless. They should have comped the meal because I didn't finish it and was grossed out. Do not go to this NNY
0,I was passing through Phoenix when I was searching for an Indian restaurant and my GPS pointed me to this place. The ambiance is very ordinary and they could definitely do better job with it.  \n\nService was reasonably prompt. They didnt ask me for a spice level when they took my order. I found the food bland for my taste. Could have done with more spice and salt. The food is alright nothing out of the ordinary.
0,The chicken pieces were very small and the batter no better than Church's imo.  The waffles were more like pancakes with maybe nutmeg and cinnamon; I'm guessing.  I have had so much better that I can't take this place seriously.  There are better places in town so I'd ship this one folks and save the $15.
1,"A very nice modern hotel in the heart of the city.  The kid's loved the pool, it has a glass bottom that looks down on the entrance.  very cool and unique surprise.  A nice Westin all around."
0,"I was told this place was good and decided to give it a shot. The blonde woman who took my order at the take out register was very icy and treated me as if they were paying me to eat there.\n\nAfter telling her \""no onions\"" on my gyro and her repeating \""ok, no onions\"" I get my food 10 minutes later and yep, onions all over it. I reminded her that said no onions on the gyro and she proceeds to look me I'm the face and say \""I didn't hear you say no onions\"".\n\nShe then asks the cooks to make another gyro because, and I quote, \""he now says he doesn't want onions on it\"".\n\nOnce I received my food the gyro was soggy, as if the pita was wet. The veggies were average.\n\nI believe in supporting local businesses but I'm never going back. The service was bad and the food was average. I can deal with average food if the experience was pleasant and the environment was welcoming, but that wasn't the case today.\n\nSave yourself the hassle and skip this place. You'll be treated with contempt and receive subpar food.....late."
1,"We never heard about this place, but visiting their website and seeing 4 stars on Yelp, we decided to give this place a try.  We made reservations on Open Table for an early dinner at 6 PM.  Not many people were there when we first got there, but when 7 PM came around, it started filling up.  I loved the interior of this place!  It had lush red velvet benches near the water fountain in the center of the room.  Very romantic feeling.  The dining chairs were nice contemporary looking with lots of mirrors on the walls making the area look larger.  It reminded me of a \""Z Gallerie\"" look.  \n\nService was very friendly.  They brought out a complimentary starter from the chef which was tuna fish on a small thin piece of crouton.  It was tasty.  I ordered a French Martini for starter.  For appetizers, we ordered the fresh oysters and their Crispy & Angry Lobster Cocktail.  Of course, we thought it was cold lobster cocktail, but it turns out being a hot dish with half a lobster in a chili sauce.  We pretty much had to work for our food!  We had to use seafood picks to remove the meat and the sauce was pretty spicy.  It looked like it was cooked in chili oil, but the flavor on the meat was good.  Lobster was still tender and not overcooked.  At least, they provided wet cloths to wipe our hands with.  Instead of a basket of bread, they brought out individual brioches presented in a measuring cup.  That was cute presentation, I thought.  It was light and fluffy.  I liked how it wasn't over fulfilling like most breads.  Butter was presented on a pink chunk of rock salt.  If you look at the kitchen, they have tons of these pink rock salts stacked up.\n\nFor dinner, I tried their roasted halibut, which came with two mini lobster dumplings, spinach, lobster bordelaise and tomato.  The portion of the halibut was bigger than I expected that I could not finish my dish.  My hubby had the filet mignon which was also pretty big.  It was cooked medium rare and tasted excellent.  The lobster dumplings that came with my dish reminded me of shumai that I didn't care too much for.  Since all the food was good, we had to try their dessert.  We ordered the \""Egg\"" chocolate, which was an egg shaped chocolate shell with cookies and cream ice cream, chocolate mousse, and chocolate chips.  It was cute looking.  We asked our server why there were eggs everywhere, since there were Humpty Dumpty sculptures around the restaurant.  It turns out David Burke's fave ingredient was egg since it has a lot of protein.  That was quite interesting!  At the end, they brought out complimentary pink cotton candy.  I haven't had cotton candy for ages as I'm not a fan of it, but it added a nice touch to the end of our great dining experience.\n\nOur server was shocked at how much we ate.  I guess we were just hungry.  But I do recommend for two people, just order 1 appetizer.  2 appetizer and a main dish is fulfilling.  We didn't expect the food portion to be quite that big so we were full at the end.  At the end, we were happy that we dined there as we had an unsatisfactory dinner the night before at Nobu."
1,"Awesome place!  Dr. Remen and staff are friendly, compassionate and professional.  You know they care about the animal and the owner.  Marge, the groomer, is great.  You know your pet is in gentle hands with her.  I've been to many, many veterinary hospitals and this is by far the best!"
0,"For a place that has the word \""chili\"" plastered across half their building and their products, I was stunned to see they use chili out of a can. And not a very good quality canned chili at that.  My god, if you're going to run a place like this, at least have one component where you're doing something special. And if you're going to have seven staffers in the building, how about having one of them sweep the floor periodically. This establishment felt like a lot of good people unfortunately giving only half their effort. The end result is a generic slice of Americana, but nothing special.\n\nThe dogs were the best part. Would have been fantastic if there'd been chili."
1,"I'm not a steak fan, and that's all they serve here, but darn it if I don't love these tacos.  There's rarely a night that I'm not in the mood to have them for dinner.  Here's the rest of my two cents:\n\n-THE BEST salsa I've ever had at a restaurant.  That's just my opinion, but it tastes like homemade... it's fresh and chunky and the perfect amount of cilantro... there's enough kick, but the flavor is just delicious.\n\n-The corn!  What they do to that corn is amazing, it's a flavor combination I've never experienced before and I love it, you have to taste it to understand though, I can't describe it. (the corn itself can be hit-or-miss... sometimes it's a little hard).  \n\n-Every time I go, I feel like I've been transported to the movie \""Honey, I Shrunk the Limes\"".  Is it possible that they get smaller with each visit??  \n\n-And yes, it is pricey.  I didn't notice it at first, because it's so good and I didn't spend that much money, but for what you get? (case in point: LIMES [see above])  Chips and salsa are $1.50, which is fine with me, but they upsold me to guacamole (I'm not a hard sell, or quick at math), and after I paid I realized that ordering the guacamole added $5 to the bill!!!!  Things like that add up...\n\nGreat place though, and the atmosphere is cool and relaxing, with a Mexico beachy vibe... I do recommend it highly, but bring your own citrus."
1,"I would have given 5 stars except, I felt the service was rushed. Before we could enjoy the chips, salsa and guacamole, the appetizers came. Before we could finish the appetizers the entree came. Then the desert. \nThere was no breathing room in between courses, and that is too bad, as the food was amazing. \nThat said, the guacamole was the best I have ever had. The chips divine, not oily not stale, just perfect. \nTwo of ordered the 42.00 per person deal, which includes one app, one entree and the dessert. \nThe appetizer was a trio of appetizers. One fried plantain, one beef taquito and one tamale. The fried plantain was great crispy on the outside, warm sweetness's on the inside. The beef taquito crunchy and delicious. I never got to the tamale, the entree came before I could try it. I did not want my entree to get cold so I bypassed the tamale. \nI had the boneless beef short ribs or corn polenta. Fabulous, the beef so tender the polenta had a little kick but not so overwhelming. My friend had the special rib eye gaucho steak. I had a taste, it was great, had I know I would have ordered it. My other friend had another special she did comment it was spicy. It was stuffed peppers I am not sure the name. \nThe portions were huge. We took half home. \nNow the dessert was fantastic, it was the special for the day. Banana cream pie. Not your ordinary banana cream pie. This had 3 layers of banana bread each separated by luscious layers of banana cream with fresh bananas, whipped cream on top and swirls of chocolate sauce. \nHonestly one of the best tasting meals I have ever had in Las Vegas. If I do get to go back I hope the service will be slower, so this wonderful food can be savored and enjyed as it was meant to be."
1,"Not only have I replaced all four of my tires here, I've also purchased several of their take-home-and-cook pizzas, gallons of vodka and wine, and take advantage of their free samples [which, by the way, can be a substitute for a meal if you're running low on cash]. While the two of us cannot justify buying a 5 gallon bucket of pickles, this is a great place to shop for a large party. The prices are good and their selection is decent."
0,The attitude of these guys sucks
1,"According to my friend, Pho So 1 is one of the oldest Pho places in Las Vegas. Well I guess that's why their Pho is so good. They've been doing it for so long that it's like second nature to make good Pho.\n\nThis is my favorite Pho place in Las Vegas. I come here so often that certain servers see me and they already have my order written down before I'm even seated (true story :P)\n\nMy favorite thing to order is item #12 a.k.a. Pho Tai Nam. I like to order the rare steak that comes with it on the side then let it soak in lime juice that way when i put it in my soup it's still a little pink by the time I get to eat it. Along with that I get the eggrolls (item #1) because they are SO DAMN GOOD. Not once have I ever visited and left disappointed with the eggrolls. They are consistently amazing every single time. They come with a decent portion of lettuce and veggies and what I do (if you've never tried) is take the eggroll and some veggies and roll it up in the lettuce leaf like a wrap, dip it in the sauce they give you and VOILA! taste bud orgasm.\n\nI gave it a 4 because some days, the service just downright sucks lol. It's okay though, the food ALWAYS makes up for it in the end.\n\nOut of townies. This is 10-15 minutes off the strip. Do yourself a favor and get your ass over here. lol."
1,"We enjoyed the omelettes, had the #7 and the #24 (can't remember the names) and they were both delicious. The portions are huge so come hungry or ready to share.  Omelets come with home made chips and banana or pumpkin bread which was moist and very tasty. The service was great and I will be back when I come back to Vegas looking for a breakfast spot"

Getting kicked out (nor kicked in) is never what I have in mind.  They do have two Picnic tables out back... This whole place is out back and if the weather is decent you will probably get eaten by mosquitoes if eating outdoors here!\n\nHidden!!!  This place is well hidden!  Thinking I would just ride up and down Polk Road (for two weeks though not continuously) until I saw it, and did four times Saturday Night (date night in case you don't know) and finally walked in to India Grocer and they politely pointed me in the right direction.  \n\nVegetarian ONLY!!!

Shop the liter sale and get joico, matrix, Paul Mitchell and redkin for $15.99 for bottles that sale for $33. They also have a huge hair tools section with a wide range of brands. By lancome here but shop the department stores first for gift with purchase. This location doesn't have clinique."
0,"What a complete dissapointment!  We got there and the waiter was kind of a smart ass.  The lighting was too bright at this junky table.  There was no silver ware or salt and pepper or anything.  We asked the waiter what he recommended and he said he hasnt eaten anything so he didnt know.  We order crab cakes and they were out in seriously like 2  minutes.  They tasted warmed up because they were cold in the middle. My husband bison burger looked prefactory made and was half the size of the bun.  My Chicken wrap, what a joke.   NO FLAVOR.  THIS PLACE SUCKED!"
0,"maybe i'm being too harsh, but i barely got a greeting here. the staffer was too busy talking to a friend who had stopped by about her childcare plans for the week. as the staffer weighed my package and completed the shipping information she continued to engage her friend in conversation and ignore me. only when it was time to ask how quickly i wanted the package to arrive did she talk to me. i guess if my package arrives at the destination they've done their job, but i don't think they did it very well. i'll find another shipper next time i need to mail something."
0,"I'm not a big fan of Walmart, I prefer Target hands down. It seems like no matter what location I go to they always smell so weird. I have been to this location a few times since moving into the area. Prices are low but so is the quality, you get what you pay for! My last visit here was with my prego friend Mary who needed to pick up a breast pump she ordered online. I was making her a yummy dinner that night so she also got a couple bottles of wine. Check out was a pain in the ass since our cashier was so slow & the old lady in front of us had a million coupons. Regardless of all the negatives, I'm sure I'll be back!"

I went up to the door and knocked, and the employee yelled \""WE'RE CLOSED!\"" I told her it wasn't even 6 o'clock but she didn't care and ignored us!! It turned out she was the manager Sammy.

1,"If you can get past the pillar box red exterior, Tea Tree Tea is a homely cafe that serves tasty sandwiches, toasties, scones, shortbread and cakes. The decor is a comfy mix of leather arm chairs and wooden tables and chairs and there's usually a bustling mix of students, mums and toddlers and small groups of friends. \n\nAs the name implies, Tea Tree Tea also serves a staggering selection of different teas from scented teas, smoked teas, fruit teas, green teas and spiced teas to tea infusions and tea lattes. All the drinks are brewed with leaves rather than tea-bags and for those with a simpler tea palette, they sell Scottish Breakfast tea.\n\nWhilst I enjoyed my cuppa, I have to be honest: I'm a coffee lover!"
0,came for a calvin harris night with presale tickets ($75+fees from online).\nthis place lacks an outside area where you can chill and talk. wasn't worth the hype.
1,"Decided to check out the new Smashburger today, as I've only been to the one on college (just once, parking is too annoying). \n\nThe restaurant was clean, and there was plenty of seating from what I could tell, I didn't look too hard though. I'd probably guess enough for maybe 30-50 people? \n\nThat staff seemed very friendly, and willing to accommodate. \n\nFor the food, I had the Big (1/2 lb) Arizona Smashburger with a side of smash fries (fries with oil, rosemary, and garlic). With the burger it had a good char, and you could tell it was made fresh and not just pre-packed patty (just by the shaping of it). the meat itself didn't taste too overly seasoned, and yes you could taste it was actually meat. I quite liked the toppings, They put plenty of guacamole on it, and felt the amount of lettuce/tomato/onion was just right (for me its where you know it is there, but it isn't so prevalent you notice it the whole time). It is somewhat greasy, thankfully they give you napkins. \n\nThe fries are alright, I'm not running out to go get more but I wouldn't avoid getting them either when I go. They are salty, at least to me (and I can tolerate a fair bit of salt), so be forewarned. I don't notice. The rosemary is a strong flavor you will notice right away. They don't seem to oily which is a plus. \n\nOverall I liked it, it didn't blow me away (as most burger joints don't) but I would recommend it if you aren't on a budget. It was basically $10 for my order, so like I said if you are on a budget, it is probably better to hit up an In N Out or Habit instead (best of the cheap places). If you are willing to spend a bit more, I don't think you'll do wrong with heading over to Smashburger."
1,"It first time here at Teriyaki Boy Healthy Grill. I looking for something on the healthy side after doing an one hour bike class. I always notice this place on my way too and from class. So figure why not give it try! Teriyaki chicken it kind of is what it is for me. Not that big of fan but look at it as more of an inexpensive meal. I normally go too Teriyaki Madness since its closer too my side of town. Always enjoy mixing the food palate up.\n\nI ordred the large teriyaki chicken bowl. I enjoyed! I thought the chicken was grilled right on nice char grill marks on both sides and nice moist. I like the vegetables they served sliced carrots (unlike more mass market or dime dozen teriyaki chicken bowls either shredded or big chunks sometimes not even cooked but raw), zucchini (again usually broccoli find), and course traditional pieces of cabbage. The teriyaki sauce not fan of overkill. So for me liked fact they have enough covered the chicken and get into the vegetables. The white rice was cooked perfect.\n\nI surprise that the menu was pretty diverse from the appetizers, the alternatives comes too brown rice, or subbing different things in it. They even offer Jay Cutler size bowl. If you don't know Jay Cutler he won the Mr Olympia before. So its big boy bowl one that if your hungry should think about ordering. \n\nTalk about small place and unfortunately located right next too LVAC so they get lot of post workout meals. I just barely found spot too eat on the counter area. If theres a  negative always positive? You can feel fit, healthy, or feel like busted sweat at the gym at Teriyaki Boy."
1,"We have been coming here forever. The long bar is a great place to grab a cocktail or glass of wine on a weekend, but the real reason to dine at Cowboy Ciao are two of their signature dishes: The Stetson Salad and The Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry. The salad is mixed table side. Order your own, you will not want to share it. Fresh arugula, plum tomatoes, salmon, corn kernels and couscous, blended with a dressing that will make your mouth happy. Yum, I get hungry just writing about it. The Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry is just as good. It is a mix of shitake, oyster, black trumpet, morel, magic (just kidding), porcini and any other kind of mushroom the kitchen can lay their hands on, swimming in an ancho cream sauce and served over polenta with avocado on top. Double yum! This is a great dish to share or order in the appetizer size."
1,"The food at this CPK is pretty good.  I guess you could say that for any of the CPKs, but they always do a nice job at this location and are very accommodating of any special requests.  I realize for the relatively low price you pay, you're not getting top-of-the-line cuisine, but it's a great for what it's intended.\n\nThe one negative thing I'd say is skip the wine list.  As you can imagine at a strip-center type chain restaurant, it's not exciting, although the staff actually seem to have a good idea of wine pairing in general for those who are new to wine.  I don't drink beer but have been told by fellow guests the beer selection is decent.\n\nThe service at this CPK is pretty good.  There are actually a few servers there that always remember me, even down to what I like to eat, even when it's been six months since I've last been in.  It's very impressive that they remember me and the staff in general (save the host staff when it's busy) is very pleasant."
1,"I really wish I lived in Downtown PHX so I could make Maizie's a regular brunch spot.  The $15 mimosa buckets are way too tempting.... actually, it's probably better I don't live near by.  We went on a Saturday morning while on a staycation in downtown (stayed at the Hotel Palomar).  We took the train up to Maizie's which was right near the stop, so convenient for out-of-towners!  It was a busy day at Maizie's but we were sat fairly quickly considering.\n\nI had the turkey avocado eggs benedict for my main meal and then the table split the french toast for a \""dessert\"".  Both were fantastic but I have to say that the french toast is by far my favorite french toast ever.  It was very sweet, so splitting it with a group of people was the best way to go about this.  It is actually made with french bread, which I don't think I've ever had it made like that before.  I was thoroughly impressed.\n\nBrunch places that serve great cocktails are rare in PHX, but this is also just a great place to eat."
0,"No free WiFi, you have to go outside to get to elevators and corridors to rooms are outside as well, which is a ridiculously bad idea in Phoenix's 100 degree heat. Trash in corridors as well. Hotel restaurant is poor as well"
1,"There is a reason why there is always at least a 30 min wait every time I come here...  The Red Velvet pancakes live up to the hype with a cream cheese icing on top.  A half-stack will satisfy you while at the restaurant, but get a full stack so you have something to munch on when you get home!"
0,"I really wanted to like this place, but they've let me down too many times. We live right down the street and were excited for a close  seemingly cool restaurant. The food is good and they have a good reverse happy hour...when it's actually available. The past 5 times we have gone on the weekend, they have either been closed or turned us away because they are completely out of food by 9pm ( when the advertised reverse happy hour starts). The excuse is always \"" we are out of food because we make everything from scratch and our food is fresh\""... From my understanding,  most good successful restaurants do that, I don't think that's a very good excuse to always be out of food, especially if you're business is serving food. I don't know how they are still in business but I'm definitely not going back because it's a waste of my time to go there just to be turned away because they aren't serving food. Supply and demand."
0,"Charges for extra shot of espresso when it is thrown away anyway. Generic, uninspired, completely mediocre. Try the crazy mocha 2 blocks away"
0,"In San Diego I had Rally's and here in Vegas I have Checker's as they are one in the same. I used to eat here a lot in back in the days and in High School because they had tasty food and a variety from the norm. \n\nI have to say my last two visits to this location has sucked spiky balls, not soft and warm ones! So after a night out of party time with the ladies we stopped through to grab a bite. We placed our order and wanted two apple pies which are boldly advertised on their menu and signs. \n\nThe cashier tells us they have none ready, so we ask can they be made or is it just not an option? The cashier informs they could be made and would take ten minutes to make. Ok so we passed on it and drive up to the window to pay for our order.\n\nWe sit at the drive thru after paying for 15 minutes waiting on our order. We ordered four items so I would hate to know how long the wait would have been for a large order. I told my friend had I known it would have taken 15 minutes for our order anyways then I would have ordered the Apple pies for us.\n\nNo apology for our wait, the cashier literally shoves my friend our bag of food and shuts the window. We wait and ask for ketchup and I swear this troll rolled her eyes at us and hands us the ketchup packets.\n\nThis was our last visit as our previous visit was a crappy experience with shitty service as well. I did see the Undercover boss episode for this chain and am disappointed that this store fails so bad.\n\nThe staff has attitude and is just plain rude with a don't give a shit attitude."
0,"Never again! Terrible hotel. I wonder how they have got 4 stars. We came there to find dirty bath tub with the water that does not drain. Called maintenance but no one came so we asked the front desk to get another room. The manager at the front desk said \""it happens\"". What happens? They don't clean the room before new guests arrive? Also, they do not have a fitness center, nor enough room in the garage for their guests. They told me to park somewhere else and they will validate the ticket. Additionally, they charged me for services I did not use so I had to call them and insist to remove that charge. I would give them zero stars."
1,Went there for my anniversary dinner. The staff were all very nice and helpful. We only waited about five minutes to get our table. The one thing i didnt care for was that the restaurant was a little dim. The spinning salad was cool and also was pretty good. I had the Lawrys cut and my wife had the smaller cut and we ordered cream corn and asparagus. My prime rib was awesome nice and tender. The creamed corn was also good. The asparagus was just plain but they serve it with a hollandaise sauce on the side so that makes up for it. I was able to finish everything on the table and at te end of our dinner they gave  us a free desert which was pretty cool. Overall i liked the service and the food and the price was not bad either.
0,"Was eager to stop in see what the buzz was since it just opened, not sure how well this place will do other than just a bar seen, usually you lower food standards when going to more of a bar place like this, so I did, but even then not so good! I prefer CKs on chandler thier food is much better."
0,"I really WANT to like Triple 7.  It's the kid of place that is pretty cool to hang out with co-workers or take a time out from the action of Fremont Street.  The atmosphere is always good, service is usually pretty good - though some of the ladies are better than others (I've never had a male server there).\n\nIt's mere blocks from where I work, so it tends to be someplace we fall back on, but in the past few months, I haven't had great experience when branching out on the menu.  Nearly everyone has a favorite food and doesn't eat much else.  We like the salads, pizza, grilled chicken, sushi and most of the appetizers. \n\nWe keep going back because it's close, the drinks (at the Casino bar next to the buffet) are cheap and the service is pretty good.  They don't fret when 8 people come in all of a sudden and want a table.  If the food was better, they'd probably get 4 stars, but as it is, they get 2.\n\nSo... based on my experience - Do's and Don'ts\n\nDo:\nStop at the Casino bar before coming in - the drinks are cheaper (.99 Margaritas, $1.25 beer)\nTry the sushi - it's probably my favorite thing on the menu.  I've tried a variety of it and while the selection isn't huge, it is good.\nHave a salad or something else that you know the kitchen has to make.  Much of the food is frozen, but the fresh things are good.\n\nDon't:\nEat the burgers - they are frozen, premade patties that never taste good.\nMake it complicated - the kitchen doesn't take change well\nTry to get split checks - just come with cash if you're in a group."
1,"I was in Charlotte on a business trip with my boyfriend, and his company put him in this Marriott.  Overall, it was a good stay.  The room was clean, housekeeping service was good, nice location (across the street from SouthPark Mall), and fantastic staff.  We had free wifi and free breakfast using my Marriott Club card.  Will stay here again if coming to Charlotte."

0,"I was excited to try the chicken fingers as I had been craving some all day. This was my first time here so I didn't really know what the menu was. Actually thought that the streamlined menu was good. I figured since the menu was simple that everything would be very good. I ordered two \""Box\"" combos. The chicken tenders were tender but had no flavor. How can your signature item be bland. The Texas toast also had no butter or garlic flavor and was barely toasted. The fries were just basic small crinkle cut fries but did not hold any salt on them. The cole slaw was ok but not great. The best part of the meal was the sauce but I really wasn't expecting to have to drown the chicken tenders in sauce to give them flavor.  I had high hopes but was very disappointed."
1,"I'm going to give them 4 stars because our server, while a little awkward, tried really hard to make sure we were happy.  It was a little hard for me to select an entree here because everything, and I mean everything, seems to either be spicy or loaded with cilantro.  Two of my biggest dining foes.  \n\nI ended up with the fried calamari roti (burrito) with whichever was the lightest spiced curry.  I forgot to mention the cilantro thing at first and so after we ordered I remembered and got our servers attention.  He took care of it right away and my food did come out cilantro free, phew!\n\nI also had the squash casserole and side salad because I was told the mac-n-cheese was even spicy, made with a queso sauce.  Sides were okay, I did try my sistersmac and while yes it did have a kick, I found it pretty tolerable and very yummy!\n\nBrownie in an orange was weird and the orange flavor on everything was a bit much for me.  But it wasn't bad.  Overall this might not be a place suited to my tastes, but I appreciate what they are doing and I wish them success!"
1,Everything was awesome! The presentation was beautiful and the chef came out to meet and talk to us.
1,"The new roof too is beautiful, limited bar, and only one bartender which made for slower service, but it was a good starter for the night. Drinks were very pricey, I left with a 100$ tab. Will go back just gotta drink less next time. Gorgeous views, laid back, and fun. Wish there was louder popular music. Could be good with a few tweaks :)"
0,"Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nGood and cheap Mexican food absolutely must be inclusive in order to work.  Here it's just barely.  Saying that, I still decided to go more than once.\n\nFirst go was on a weekend when they make Menudo.  This is a dish that will usually either scare me from future visits or endear the place to me.  For the first time ever: all I could say about it was, \""meh.\""  Apparently there is a variation of Menudo that's neither great nor horrible.  The tripe was tender and for the most part trimmed well.  The broth was definitely lacking some flavor, but not that a few additions didn't remedy it sufficiently.  My biggest issue was that probably a good third of my order was taken up by one of their stewing bones that just happened to get scooped in there.  It can happen, but this one was too big to be entirely negligence.\n\nSecond go involved two tacos.  I like to pit a place's carnitas versus adobada to see which one I prefer of theirs.  For the record, their adobada won this battle.  Really, in my experience, I haven't seen many places with the skill to screw up either of these.  Both were quite tastey, but the portions I'm used to were slightly lacking.  I guess I've been spoiled by places that have made me wonder if there was a tortilla under there.  They didn't just skimp on the meat though, but also the toppings.  Just a smidge of pico de gallo and a dollop of guacamole that wouldn't take me too much convincing that they bought from a supermarket.  Still I will point out that both the carnitas and adobada were well prepared and full of the right flavors.\n\nA special note will go to their pickled carrots, onions, and jalapenos.  It's pretty difficult for a condiment to catch my attention, and truth be told, I almost missed out.  On my first visit, someone, noticing my initial indecisiveness on the menu, deduced that I had never tried them and recommended them heartily.  The fact that they provide sandwich bags to be able to take some home means that it's no secret the stuff is good.  Cooked just to the right amount to have both some caramelization and crunch.  Spiced and pickled to be tangy without an overbearing heat.\n\nAn all latino and friendly staff -- which is a must in my book.  English isn't the best, and something tells me even a little Spanish will get you a tad better service.  Either way, it's all pretty decent."
0,"Lunch here was horribly disappointing, but in no way inexpensive. The salad I ordered claimed apple and avocado, but the slivers were pathetic, very few and in no way fresh. I added scallops for an extra $6 and they gave me two about as big around as quarters. The taco strips were so stale they were chewy. To make matters worse, gnats were all over us the entire time. For this pathetic salad, two measly scallops and iced tea, my bill was over $19 before tip! We agreed this was our last visit there."
1,This is our second time to go. Still love the salsa and the food. Great place to take a large group we had a party of 15 and had plenty of room and the service was good.
1,"Love the deserts and the soup and sandwiches, this place is definitely serving some delicious food but the long waits to purchase and hard time finding a place to seat inside is a  turn off for me."
0,"The location of the Westin is very convenient and booked here on recent trip to Vegas for some R&R. Priceline made the selection and the price was reasonable. Is this really a 4-star hotel?! \n\nAs for the actual hotel: check-in was prompt and the staff was friendly. The room was nice, but the cleaning staff left some hairs behind in the bathroom. The walls must have been made of paper, our neighbors on the right must have been on Spring Break and did not understand the concept of quiet and had to call the front desk to quiet these fools down twice in the same night. The neighbors on the left had a twisted sense of humor and mocked having sex or maybe actually did perform the deed, but the commotion only lasted 2 minutes. Premature ejac...? Sad anyway! The experience was exhausting and the only saving grace was the mattress and a Starbucks adjacent to the sad and smallish casino. Steer clear unless the Westin decides to reinforce their walls!"
1,"St. Hubert has delicious food but my biggest complaint is the lack of servers. I came here on a weekday and it wasn't busy at all but there were two waiters and one hostess and they had an entire restaurant to serve. At one point all of them were at the bar mixing drinks and there were times we could not find a waiter. Dinner ended up taking THREE HOURS from start to finish. \n\nThe food was delicious and pretty fairly priced. I got the meal that came with unlimited soda and dessert for $20. The chicken was tender and had amazing flavor. My volcano cake was good too. I had unlimited soda but because the waiter never came by, I only had two cups. Also the waiter never offered me cole slaw or the option to change my sides. He didn't give a shit, really. \n \nP.S no matter how curious you are, do not order the BBQ Ranch cocktail. You will throw it all up. It's absolutely disgusting. The drink tastes like cold chicken. \n\nP.P.S the waiter was delicious so I forgive his slow service \n\nP.P.P.S there was a homeless lady we watched from the window that was hustling people for money. At one point she was pushing people so that made for good three hour entertainment."

0,"My friend brought me to the Allstate Arena for the show this past Saturday evening for the 8:00 pm show.  First of all, seeing or hearing anything musically at the Allstate Arena, is a big mistake as it is not an acoustically correct venue and most sound engineers are deaf anyways.  But I expected music - rock music and arrangements orchestra...not singing and vocalists...\n\nIt was horrible, lose the singers or lose the venue, or your sound people...probably at a smaller venue or Rosemont Theater would have been better.  Overall it was very disappointing and we left after 2 hours of the show...we couldn't handle it anymore."
0,"The worst Salmon I've ever had. The service was garbage. The restaurant was dirty and again... the worst Salmon I've ever had. I've been to my share of Hard Rock Cafe's so, for food, service, cleanliness.. I'll have to give two thumbs down in a 360 rotation."
1,"Went here on NYE, was not initially planning on it, but ended up here instead of next door. Vinny is always telling me I need to hit up these places, so we did.\n\nObviously, it being NYE I was expecting It to get packed, It was crowded, but not stifling so 90% of my time there, except up until about 11:45, I think they let a few too many people in, the floor by the far back bar area was WAY too crowded, I mean, completely. You couldn't even MOVE anywhere. People were trying to get to the bar, but it was just a bit too cramped. It was like trying to part the red sea at 12:30 when my friend and myself were attempting to leave.\n\nPrior to that though, it was enjoyable. My 10$ jack and coke was a bit overpriced for what it was, the bar tender stacked it so full with ice, that I think it was gone in about 5 sips....a tad bit of a letdown for 10$ ha ha. However, I danced for a good two hours, have a blister on my toe from my heels, and had a nice time up until the complete sardine packing near the midnight countdown.\n\nDid not try any of the food though, being that it was party night. The building is pretty cool. I enjoy the indoor\\outdoor vibe. Although, I'm not sure how that fares when it is 115degrees outside, they better have a darn good AC system. (; Plenty of TVs around for (I'm assuming) game nights and such. That night The bar-tender was fast and pleasant. Obviously did not strike up a conversation with him, but he noticed me and got my order quickly. The music selection was danceable and fun. Only 1 or 2 songs I couldn't stand (by personal preference, of course), otherwise it was all good in the hood for me that night. Made my NYE fun, especially on a ridiculously cold and rainy night!!"

I was quite turned off by my first visit there earlier this year, and the same thing happened when I tried the 16th Street location. \""Chacun a son gout\"" and all that but, every one knows ICE cream is mean to be served FROZEN.  One should be able to lick it without the whole dissolving into soup within 2 minutes. My advice to this place is stop trying to create the world's most esoteric flavor combos and for the love of Pete PLEASE. buy. a. better. freezer.\nI fully expected for the $4 dollar something single cone to start dripping when I got outside back into the desert heat, but not as it is handed to me over the counter. \nWon't be back."
0,"We ordered from this place several times over the two months we have lived in Dormont and the food quality was pretty decent, nothing special but better than some other places in the area. However, a recent disappointment with their service has left me hating the place.\n\nThere was once a time when the customer was always right. You don't sit on the phone and argue with the people that are paying you're bills.\n\nAnyways, the story goes like this. We ordered food for delivery and it arrived on time. The kid delivering the food did not greet us at the door, he just stood there like a plank of wood. We gave the guy a 3  dollar tip for driving less than 3 blocks and didn't even get a thank you, he just walked off without acknowledging us at all.\n\nNormally I'm not the type to complain to management, if I'm unhappy with the service I just won't go back but seeing as how I am currently unemployed along with many other people who have been hit by the economy and still gave the kid a tip, I was pretty miffed about his attitude so I called up and asked that they remove the tip.\n\nAfter some muffled talking in the background the lady came back to the phone and said she would remove it but that they had delivered to our apartment many times and never been given a tip. I called BS because we have only been here for about two months and only ordered from the place 3 times.\n\nI told her that it must have been the previous tenants but she did not believe me and never offered an apology for the delivery guy's behavior. I told her to keep the 3 bucks and hung up and I will never order from them again. \n\nNews flash for all local businesses; When a customer calls up to politely complain about how poor the service was, don't try to argue with them just apologize and make the situation right, that's how you keep a customer."
0,"Can we just talk about the bacon and cheese sandwiches here.\n\nUsually, when you order a cheese sandwich, you expect to receive cheese with your sandwich, right?\nWell, not here. Not at Nana's.\nAt Nana's they give you some sandwich with your cheese.\n\nThe slab of (apparently Kraft) cheese was almost thicker than my finger. It oozed out of the sides of the sandwich and malevolently crept onto my plastic plate, spreading its unnaturally orange goo wherever it touched. The other ingredients of the salad - bacon and salsa - seemed to hide in the bread, recoiling from the menace below.\n\nEating the sandwich, all I could taste was the cheese.\nThere was no bacon. There was no salsa.\nOnly cheese.\n\nI'm uploading a photo of the sandwich so you can see for yourself. It's truly a monstrosity.\n\nOther than the Sandwich from Cheesy Hell, the restaurant was awkwardly quiet, the airspace filled only by the ticking of the clock and the clicking of silverware on plastic as the restaurant's one other patron, an elderly man, picked at his salad.\nI didn't feel \""welcome\"" and the staff weren't \""friendly\"", as other reviews have raved. I felt like I was at a Western-decorated mortuary.\n\nAt least the apple pie was good."
1,"very nice service, friendly people, fast delivery to the table and very good food; the only thing keeping it from a 5 star is the price...a little high for a burger place and very small so during busy nights it would be tough to get in."
0,"We decided to check this place out after reading some of the reviews.  I guess I am disappointed because I had such high expectations.  This is just a regular coffee shop.  I was there with my husband and one of my twins.  I was going to order the breakfast burrito, but I wanted it with turkey sausage.  The girl at the counter told me they couldn't do it.  Ok, so I chose the Turkey sausage, egg and cheese on an English muffin.  I requested a scrambled egg for my little girl, again the girl at the counter told me they couldn't do that.  The eggs come pre-made in the shape of a patty, that sounded as appetizing as my sneakers after a 3 mile run.  I decided to cancel the food and pay for the coffee and bottled OJ I got for my baby.  Too bad, I am always looking for breakfast places."
0,"Food is mediocre but the popcorn is awful. This is the only theatre that serves extremely salty popcorn. How do they manage to ruin popcorn?? Servers are a mixed bag. Few are good, others are sleepy. Don't go here for the food."
1,This restaurant is delicious.  YUM.  Fresh tasting peanut sauce on the spring rolls ... and delicious spring rolls.  It's small and the d\u00e9cor is trendy.  I saw kids there but if I were you I'd try to avoid busy times b'c it's not too big.  Good service.  A little on the expensive side but they serve a mean lychiejito.
1,"under 475 calories for each dish....that is amazing! it just proves that you can have phenomenal, simple, yet healthy food and still feel full. \n\nwe shared the yellow beet salad (delicious) and the ravioli app (again, delicious). then for my entree, i had the trout. it was so smooth and tender, i can't believe they didn't use an ounce of butter to cook it. the asparagus and carrots were expertly al-dente (i think that's how you spell it). my girls scallop dish was just as delicious. seared and tender just perfectly. \n\nwe absolutely couldn't leave without trying a mini-desert dish. the pecan pie was heavenly in every scoop as was a (shared) key lime pie. \n\na great restaurant. it's too bad it's a little on the pricey side. what would be great is to have a place like this so more people could see what good, healthy food can be. overall......best restaurant food i've had in a long time!"
0,I would give no star if I could. I was with my pregnant wife and my 3 year old son and they called our name after waiting 30 minutes. They called our names and we went up but the hostess  rudely told us some one else with the same name already took our spot and we were not up yet. I asked for her to check and again was rudely spoken to being told I need to stop talking. She eventually checked where my spot was in the list and she realized she did in deed give our spot to the wrong person. Staff was disrespectful and could care less about their customers. Needless to say we will not be putting any more of our money at this restaurant.

1,The best Cuban food you can get in this town. Very home style. The chicken tends to be a little dry at times but over all the food is good. Their Black bean stew or habichuelas guisado (IS NOT A SOUP Mark W.) is delish and their yucca mojo is yummy.
0,"The room was loaded with dust in areas not easy for housekeeping to reach, causing us some respiratory issues at night.  Traffic noise disturbed my wife.  We were charged for an upgraded room without our knowledge.  Furnishings were from 1980.  Casino reeked of cigarette smoke.  Check-in line was 45 minute wait.  Convention area was nice."
0,"Just stopped in for lunch today and boy what a shocker. Ordered Hot Tea and it was far from hot. cool at best. Then the *Food*, all Cool / Luke warm and tasteless. seriously people! And there were kids all over the place fingering all the silverware (Kids, as in the owners kids). Service was crud and food was crud. NEVER AGAIN! Avoid at all costs."
1,"I walk inside and it's like someone found Martha Stewart's secret craft room and snatched away all the creative treats! I don't even know where to begin with Melrose Vintage. This is the one stop shop for gifts. Why you ask? Well... if you are looking for any of the following either for yourself or a friend, you'll find it here:\n\n- Baby accessories \n- Knicks and Knacks for your home decorating \n- Furniture - both vintage and copy vintage \n- And then there's the craft room...\n\nThe craft room in itself requires a full day of exploration. Upon first glance, I was overwhelmed with excitement when I imagined all the wondrous things I could create with the tools surrounding me. When I looked even deeper, I realized that all of the items are incredibly unique to the store and you won't be able to find them anywhere else or at least not at your typical chain craft store. Everything is hand crafted and begs for a master creative creation. From scrap-booking to crafting exactly like Martha style crafts, you can find it all here. I just don't know if I can ever live up to the possibilities this store offers me! \n\nThe crafting room offers working stations, classes and even a sectioned off play room for children while their mother's explore. The front part of Melrose Vintage is a decorator's paradise and full of every possible home item you could think of. Those searching for the unique baby accessories in their life have a room entirely dedicated to it. \n\nI can't wait to visit Melrose Vintage again to explore some more. I also noticed some unique holiday decorations that I'd like to snatch up!"
0,"VERY poor customer service...had a bad experience with an online order \""Ship to Store\"" -- have ordered in the past to another Walmart without a problem.  Therefore, I really think it's just this store.  Aside from the fact that it is dirty looking, floors never look clean, the CS reps for the most part are poorly trained, unmotivated to be helpful.  They get one star because they do have a handful of employees that seem dedicated, helpful & friendly.  My online order experinece at this store was negative mainly because of a poorly trained, unfriendly, unhelpful employee by the name of Jessica...Shame on her supervisor for putting this type of service out there...Stay away from this store unless it's an emergency!!!!"
0,"In a neighborhood full of Piri Piri restaurants, this one really does not rise to the top of the list. The food is okay at best. Don't get me wrong, it's not horrible. But I would never recommend it! Now that being said, if you're dying for chicken and you're not close to saint laurent or Rachel Street, this might be your best option, because 100 meters away is St-hubert, home of premature chickens."
1,"Seriously - probably one on the best dinners my wife and I have ever had - seriously!\n\nWe chose the Prix Fixe menu that included the Lobster Salad, Pan Seared Scallop, Foie Gras, Colorado Lamb - all delicious - I could have had an entire plate of the Scallop and Foie Gras for dinner - they were that good.\n\nNot only was the food fantastic - but the service was 5 star.  Our captain Roger was such a  knowledgeable professional.  He took us thru every wine pairing - explaining what accents/notes/flavors we should be looking for in the food and the wine.\n\nSpeaking of wine - Robert - the sommelier - was outstanding.  Helping us pair wines with the prix fixe - that were outside of the wine pairing option.  Everyone of his picks hit it out of the park.\n\nAll I can say is \""fantastico!\"" - when back in Vegas - I'm coming back to Picasso.\n\nMy wife and I thank you for such a memorable night !"
1,"Chizona's is awesome. The atmosphere is great, the staff was really friendly and helpful the first time we went in, not to mention the pizza is a delicious traditional Chicago style, which is hard to find around here. I have yet to try the chicago beef, but it's next on the list. Fantastic spot."
0,"I went to Tivoli Village on a Saturday afternoon with some friends.We were walking around,then decided to go to Poppy Den. The place was practically empty! It took 15 min just to be seated,there was no hostess to greet us. It seemed as if they didn't have enough staff on that shift. Service was horrible, the food, as if they bought it from Costco. The only thing that was good was the music. I will never go back."
0,"I have now been in Spouts a total of 3 times.  Each time I have been in there, the pricing does not match the specials on several items.  The last time I went there, I told the cashier that 2 items were not priced correctly (one item that I purchased and one item that I didn't).  She just looked at me and says \""it happens\"" and didn't change the pricing on the item I did buy to the correct price or offer the item free as many stores do.  She simply didn't care.  I did mention to her that stores get fined for not having their pricing correct.  She still didn't care.  I have now contacted The Nevada Consumer Affairs to alert them to this problem since the store employees don't seem to care.\n\nAnd finally, the last trip my wife made to this store, they over charged her ATM by $20.  The bill should have been only for $22 and then the charge came thru as $42.  It appears that the cashier somehow was able to take cash back on the transaction and pocket the money.\n\nI'm really disappointed with this store and won't be going back."
0,"Is it possible to give a place lower than a 1 star on Yelp ? Seriously, this place needs it.\n\nLocated in an old strip mall on the east side of town, the outside actually looks nice, once you fight your way through the door it all seems to go down hill from there.\n\nAs the only people in the place it was surprising to be ignored, a request for a table for 6 took us to a table for 4...Yep, this is how it would be....\n\nNow I should say, we have eaten here before, but my mother in law grabbed a groupon for the place so the choice was taken out of my hands.....\n\nMenus delivered, a whole two of them for the 6 people....\n\nFood and drinks ordered...then nothing, for 30 minutes we sat, nobody to check on drink refills etc.\n\nTo the food. Descriptions taken from their menu :\n\nVeggie Pakoras, Mixed vegititables in a special batter. fried to a crispy brown, by which they mean a mixture of onions...I actually love Chicken Pakoras, the batter was ok, but seriously, if you are going to offer a mixture of vegetables, actually serve a mixture.\n\nBack to being ignored for another 20 minutes.\n\nMixed Tandoori Combo,  Mixed Tandoori Combo seekh kabob,Chicken tikka boti,Chicken Tandoori (Two), actually not bad, the seekh kabob was probably the best thing I ate there.\n\nChicken Handi, Pieces of chicken cooked in a butter flavored cream sauce, a not so good version of buttered chicken.\n\nShrimp masala, not listed on the one line menu, but if you know Indian you can figure it out...Blah, pretty much blah.\n\nA couple of orders of plain nan and garlic nan, actually the second best thing behind the seekh.\n\nMeal finish, time to be ignored again...seriously do these people have no idea on how to run a restaurant ? If you leave the floor unattended for 20-30 minutes at a time, with the door jammed open, people will walk out, not pay bill, get fed up and leave...\n\nSo with a little bit of work the food could be ok, the service..well there is none so it doesn't apply.\n\nIf you're looking for a good Indian meal try Everest or India Masala."
1,"I cannot explain the pastry here.  The guava pastry is insane.   That with a side of black beans, and varied plantains, I'm in love.  I'm a vegetarian, so there were not many options for me.  I would have loves a veggie type version of the empenadas , but the food was great anyway!  I plan on returning in the morning to see the full selections."
0,"For the love of pizza that My coworkers & I share we decided to try this place  we haven't been to near our office. A nice marketing lady came by and dropped off a few flyers of their menu. On the menu it stated if you dine in you'll get complimentary cheesy bread with your meal. When we got there and mentioned it the waiter told us that his boss wasn't in so he can't honor that. That's confusing. Than I asked him what your soup of the day was and he Unconfidently stated there isn't a soup of the day. Mm.. No bread & no soup of the day. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nThe Caesar salad my coworkers ordered was just lettuce & one wedge tomato. There was no croutons, onions or any type of cheese which usually comes with a Caesar salad. \n\nMy Italian Wedding soup came out warm. If I don't have to blow on the spoon before I put it in my mouth than it's not hot enough. The pizza was pretty ok, nothing that really made it special. I'd rather go a parking lot over to East West pizza for lunch and get 2 slices of pizza that comes with a drink for $5."
0,"As I read some of these reviews I can relate. As Alex and Michael stated the food is SOOO bland and I wonder why I keep going back. It is always hot in there and the tables outside are always dirty. (Like others said as well)\nSara B. Im warning you, dont go back to try them you will regret it  HAHA! \nI really, really wanted to love this place. Its so close to my condo & not much else around there. I have been prob 4 or 5 times for food, trying new things and probably 20 because the sweet tea WAS amazing in the hot summer. Now they changed that and its not that great and its half the size as before.\nThe other day we ordered carry-out grilled chx breast plain with bbq on the side with cole slaw, burger well with mac and cheese and two sweet teas. Things have changed, but its still bad, now worse. My husband grew up in Virgina Beach/NC and knows southern food. Unfortunately this place has never got it right, which I so desperately wanted to love it I gave it WAY more chances, than normally I would. The lady told me give me 15-20 minutes. About 15 minutes later my husband is walking out the door and my phone rings. I said \""Wait\"" thats the BBQ place. I answer, she tells me, We've had some construction and I cant find the Chx Breasts. WHAT? Are you serious?LOL It took you 15 minutes to call me and say that and how do you \""lose\"" food? Anywho I ended up ordering white shredded chx sandwich. She said 10 minutes. He sat around and then went up to pick it up. When he got their the guy told him, he was sorry for the call and they just had a huge order come in that cleaned them out of Chx. Breasts. WHAT are you serious? That is not what the lady told me, its like just be honest ppl! Then we get our food. I stg the Cole Slaw tastes like Miracle Whip and pepper or something. SOOO bland. The Mac and Cheese is so bland, I felt like I was eating Macaroni with a light cheese paste. It was bad. The sandwich was slimy and so gross I almost threw up. I put it back in the box and in the bag. My husband had 3 bites of the hamburger and felt sick. He NEVER complains about restaurants. He said to me, Why do we keep going here? Its always the same and terrible! I had no answer...\n I called the restaurant back to let her know how horrible this food was and we both felt sick, and she goes \""Well what do you want\"" I said WHAT I just wanted to let you know. She said \""Do you want another order?\"" I said no way. I am sick to my stomach and so is my husband. She was soooo rude to me. I said Listen I thought you would want to know. She said \""Bring the food back up and I will give you a refund.\"" I was going to and had it all boxed up, but I just didnt have time to get back up there. Its not like thats what I want to do on my Sunday afternoon. I had WAY to much to do.I will NEVER be back and I will NEVER tell anyone to try it. I saw a GROUPON for there before, DON'T DO IT. Not worth it. Dont try it! \nMy neighbors in the condos said the same thing recently when chatting with them.  \nThe guy ( I think he owns it) that is always there is super cool. There are a couple females that always seem like they are in a bad mood for some reason. \nTrust me, its not cheap and its not good. Not worth it!"
1,"There are many Mexican restaurants you could go to in Phoenix.  Most of them are very similar with the menu and flavors.  I put this one above most.  The food is good, the menu has everything you would expect to find and a few you might not.  But the atmosphere and service put this place high on my list.  I really enjoy the mix of chips you get.  Some fluffy some crisp.  Yum,,,"
0,"This review is for the location on Mtn Spring in chinatown: please for the love of baby Jesus stay away from this place. We rented our property on an emergency basis and I didn't bother to look up reviews before hand. RIGHT NOW: my air conditioner has gone out for the third time within a 4 month period. First time was arnd April and thankfully it wasn't hot but from the time I reported it broken to the time it was fixed was nearly 2 weeks. 2nd time was 4th of July weekend and from time of report to fixing it was out 4 days. 3rd time is now and I reported it broken on July 29 and my air is not fixed and it's frickn over 105 degrees out. Since I have 4 kids in the home, I had no choice but to purchase a very small $300 portable air conditioning unit and when I emailed this lady that I was going to take the expense off rent and she said \""yes\"", I get there to pay my adjusted rent minus the expense and these fools want the entire rent and told me IF the home warranty ppl (the ones paying for repair/replacement of AC) decides to reimburse me that's up to them but they want all the rent...OH HELL TO THE NO! so now I have to work through this problem. Apparently they want my children to die of heat stroke and exhaustion before they will think about making any kind of accommodations even though THEY are responsible for managing the property and maintaining it according to state law. Sooo now I'm going to call housing authority and get in touch with a lawyer for their gross negligence. My youngest is 9 months old ppl! This is absolutely crazy and no one frickn knows when the AC unit will be fixed b/c \""they order part or something\"". Just stay away, just say no!!"
0,"I got on yelp to see some korean bbq in the area and saw close to 4 stars so tried it out but wont be coming back. The food basically sucks compared to any of the spots in LA (except for this 1 place; unfortunately I forgot the name) .. lol. The service was ok but Ive had better in much less expensive restaurants. Oh, yea .. I spent about the same amount of money as I would at 5 star places in LA. On the good side the waitress gave us 20% off our bill for some reason. \nIm not sure if Vegas has a good korean bbq spot but I know for a fact the Vietnamese joints are as good as in LA.  \n\noh ya ... this place is open 24/7."
1,What fantastic service! Rich the bartender is very attentive and Jorge the chef came out to give free samples. Half price cocktails named after books on happy hour. Best pina colada I've ever had. Not pretentious and a legit menu. Will come back.
1,"I've now been to Pizza Rock twice. First things first, why not 5 stars? Basically because I've been here twice and I have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. What the heck Pizza Rock? I don't typically go around asking, Hey can I get a local discount? But. When I've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, I've been able to get 20% off but haven't? Arg. That ruffles my feathers.\n\nOn to what is GOOD. Happy hour is awesome. Personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. My friends and I came here during HH and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared the meatballs. Okay. I'm no meatball expert but I think these are delicious. Meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. I also like that these meatballs are simple. I've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. Another reason I like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. Quality. I think.\n\nOther than HH.... I came here with my hubby on a Saturday night. Luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. Service was quick and to the point. Our server neither impressed me or upset me so I'll give a neutral rating for service.\n\nWhat we ordered... The New Yorker 23. It was the one pizza on the menu I figured my picky (and rather plain-Jane) husband would enjoy. The New Yorker comes with: Sliced Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Sliced House Link Sausage, Garlic, Pepperoni, Ricotta. I asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. They were happy to oblige. Under the menu it says, \""Winner, Best Traditional, Las Vegas\"". I'm not sure what that means.\n\nOverall thoughts on the pizza... I enjoyed it. I love the thin crust style. The mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. Pepperoni... Okay. The Ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni and garlic. The flavors were that of a \""normal\"" pizza, but with a refinement. I think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\n\nFinal decision: Mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. Although delicious, I would rather go back for the happy hour. HH is your best bet here. And ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. You'll probably get a discount, unlike me. I'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\n\nOther things I want to go back for:\n\nTheir Margherita (only 73 made per day)\nClam and Garlic Pizza\nLa Regina (The Gold Cup Winner)\nQuail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale Pizza\nCal Italia (again, this comes as one of the Personal Pizzas on HH menu and is a FoodNetwork winner)\nThe Chorizo Mussels (App)\nAnd I would come back again for the meatballs.\n\nLooks, like I'll be making a few return trips. The great thing is, I am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where I live now."
1,Quite gem hidden in China Town. Food is good and priced well for Vegas. Definitely on the list of must visit when in Vegas.
0,"I went here to exchange a part (oil drain plug) that I purchased from another location that did not fit my car at it should. It turned out the package contained the incorrect plug (from the manufacturer). When returning the part, the guy at the counter asked the supervisor what to do with the part I was returning.... He said 'Re-sell it. We have to for inventory'. So you're going to try to sell it to someone else knowing it is wrong??? That's horrible."
0,"Restaurant smells bad. Tempura udon is tasteless, octopus sushi taste like metal, hamachi sashimi is so so. Overall, menu was a little expensive for mediocre quality food. Service was nice."
0,"Definitely one of my worst Vegas hotel experiences:\n\n1. The hotel room doors have nothing to stop them from slamming shut. This is not only a danger to children with heavy doors slamming shut, but guess what you will get to hear all night? Drunk people coming home and slamming their room doors. Midnight...1am...2am...3am...\n\n2. The hotel is connect to the MGM grand and the strip...via a more than a half mile corridor one-way. There are moving sidewalks, but they functioned about 25% of the time during our stay.\n\n3. Only half the wall electrical outlets in the room worked. Some had metal pieces sticking out of the wall.\n\n4. Their \""low-flow\"" toilet took 20 minutes to fill...that's 20 minutes between flushes. Hope your group isn't in a rush to use the bathroom when you get back to the room..."
0,"it's dennys, long wait for food, lackluster service and a hair in the eggs that tasted like vinegar make this a visit that I hope we will all soon forget. It made me feel cheap and dirty, like I needed a shower after having ate a turkey burger with a stale bun. =-("
0,"Waste of time, jumping into the Ohio river with your mouth open in search of your own catch like a Pelican would have been a better option. This place is nothing but another chain with mediocre food and spoiled college kids working tables. \n\nThe crab was over cooked, the fried fish was soggy and deep brown. It was 6pm when do they change their oil? For the overall quality you are given the value is 2x what you should be paying. It's on par with Red Lobster, the only difference is they shove everything in a pale. My 4 yr old like that...If I was that Pelican I would have flown away if I knew better.  That was the first and last time for us at Joes. \n\n\nScore\nFood Quality 2\nService 2\nAtmosphere 4 ( it's Pittsburgh how can you score bad!)\nValue 1 \nRecommend 1"
0,"I have been here several times in my years in vegas  (about 11 years), and it was ok-good. \nBUT YESTERDAY, was the worst. Came in around 2 am, had to wait for 10 mins for a table. Even though theres only 1 staff in the restaurant, i was still upset. \n\nI ordered the sunada combo (tofu spicy soup and short ribs, and couple of side dishes) for $15. \n I love the some of the side dishes, the worst are the kimichis, the best are the broccoli, potato salad, and the bean sprouts. \nThe short ribs were the worst. it was marinated with some sour taste soy sauce base. ehhhhhh!!!!!!!!! the worst. \nThe soup was good, bunch of seafood and tofu and vegiis. \nOverall, not coming back for couple of months."
1,"Glad that we found a place with an atmosphere reminiscent of our Blind Onion at home. MM has an excellent beer selection, which is great for self proclaimed beer snobs like my BF and  I. For the life of me, I cannot figure out how someone would drink a Girl's Light when there are so many more fantastic tasty beers available! But I digress....So far the only pizza we tried has been the buffalo chicken. I didn't expect it to be good, but it was! Fresh ingredients are clearly obvious. The only draw back is that it is a bit on the pricey side, but I am definitly up to try more of their menu."
1,"Having progressive insurance is by far the best insurance to have first and foremost and having a real cool, caring and productive Agent also helps too. So, due to someone side swipping my car while in a parking lot, I ended up here. \n\nThis place has Great customer service, the 2 ladies that helped me were very welcoming and informative on what was to come of my car on both visits.  I dropped off my car on 3/18 and finished on 4/1, the due date, also they had a rent a car awaiting my dropoff.\n\nThe body collision center that fixed my car did a great job on the paint and remodeled of both driver rear panels."
0,"I'm taking three stars off for the ridiculous couture pops. Like, if I could take three stars off my rating of our SOCIETY OF NINCOMPOOPS THAT BUY THIS CRAP, I would do so. I don't usually point to a luxury item and say, 'Imagine how many people you could feed for the price of this', but a rhinestone-encrusted lollipop holder crosses a line. That such an item exists, fine, but the price point needs to be taken down a dark alley and shown a straight-to-DVD American Pie sequel. \n\nThat being said, I do like candy and gelato, which Sugar Factory does well. I wish more of the items had listed prices because with the stupid couture pops priced at $25, who knows how supposedly trendy the rest of the stuff is."
0,Great sausage   Wonderful spicy rich flavor obviously made with feeling.  That almost made me go to two stars or??? But my family was just so disappointed overall that I'm sticking with one star. \n\nAmbiance:  kitchy Italian knick knack filled dining room which is a little over the top but fun.  No problems\n\nService was terribly.  So slow. We arrived before 9 and it was 9:50 before anyone took our order and then only because we flagged down someone. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen in this half filled not busy restaurant.  \n\nMeal comes with salad.  Could be yummy but we can't say since ours never came. \n\nEntrees included that yummy sausage but also cold dense ricotta noodles   Other yelps raved over this dish so huh??? Maybe the chef was asleep or we were getting the final dregs of the day.  Unclear. \n\nGot the bill.  They charged us for blue cheese on the salads we never got.  Huh again?   Didn't correct the bill but offered us free tiaramusu which also NEVER came. Huh. \n\nWe called and complained and the owner seemed nice and apologetic but stilll....\n\nOne star.
1,"I've stayed here a few times.  Always consistent. Service, rooms, restaurants and casino are all A+.  We had a lame experience at Sea Blue but that was it."
1,"This new ramen joint is another one of those that recently opened up on spring mountain rd by china town. They are specialized in miso flavored ramen and you get to choose from 3 different types. Have tried all 3. My favorite will be the shiro miso. \n\nThe atmosphere reminds me of the ramen shops in japan. Nothing fancy but relaxing. They have an open kitchen which to me is always a plus cuz you get to watch the chefs prepare your food. \n\nTried their side dishes as well such as gyoza dumplings and fried chicken. Decent. Their chashu pork is awesome too. Very thick and flavorful. The only thing negative or I should say my recommendation will be to have them try making the soup more hot. It's all preference but I just like my ramen to be super hot but overall, fantastic. I'll definitely come back again."
0,"Good prices, good-quality produce and a wide variety of Middle-Eastern and Latin American groceries, if you are looking for meats you'll have to go somewhere else. The Middle- Eastern guys who run the business could learn a bit of Western politeness (they are in the West, after all) and quit that aggressive attitude, more than once I have felt as I am picking groceries from a food bank rather than a place where I am paying for them."
1,"My first experience ordering from them was great! As people have said the wings are fantastic. If you are looking for a place to order pizza from and good wings are a must then I definitely recommend Il Primo. The pizza, although perhaps not quite spectacular, was also good and better than we expected. The delivery time was fair and the delivery guy himself was quite personable. I am sure we will order from them again, because we couldn't get enough of those wings!"
0,"Ordered a cab, it didn't come, ordered another cab, it never came.\nWorthless customer service has no idea where cabs are or how long they will be. Useless."
1,Sushi station was just OK needed more than just salmon & rolls but everything else was worth the price of admission.I would go back.
1,"After only a few minutes inside you completely forget that you are in Scotland, everything is so French with enthousiastic staff talking French, Michelin stickers on the door, and a nice French menu. \n\nThis is a very nice place and I had a great dinner with some Scottish-French fusion dishes. Rillette de Lapin, (rabit) was nice but a little dry and I actually would prefered French style bread with it in stead of the (I guess Scottish?) biscuits.\n\nThe entrecote of Scottish beef was beautiful and tasty. I saw on one of the neigbouring tables a great Cote du boeuf \n \nThe french (and maybe also some Scottish) cheese plate was good. The (expensive) Chateauneuf du Pape wine was excellent!\n\nThe waiting staff was very attentive and fun as well."
1,"We took the train from Mill to downtown Monday night, and heard that Switch does half-priced sangria, sooo, had to check that out. Pretty cute place.\n\nThe sangria was indeed special, and on special. We also got the hummus plate, which was really good, and I wish it came with more roasted red peppers, they were addicting! Yum. \n\nA couple little weird things though, the host stand is at the back, or middle if you consider the patio, which I guess makes sense for them, but was kinda confusing for a first timer and there was nobody manning the stand there which didn't help. We also had a total of three servers, maybe we should consider that special treatment :) \n\nBut I'll be back, gotta try the brunch still!"
0,"A \""can't believe it\"" experience.  Cottage cheese is on the menu.   They are ALWAYS out.  The manager says he doesn't order it because he has to buy too much and it goes to waste.  So order smaller?  He says corporate won't let him.  So why not take it off the menu if you're NEVER going to have it. \n\nI gave 2 stars solely because of a great server, Jeremy, who stood out at a location that is typically VERY slow.  I wish I could give more but the kitchen is always slow, the manager can't control stock and all prior visits have taken well over an hour to get a burger.  My family warned me not to order dessert because \""that always takes as long as the time to prepare the dinner order.\""  Again Jeremy was better at this as well but he remains the sole good example of an otherwise poorly run franchise location."
1,"I'm impressed, y'all! I'm a faithful Food Network cooking show watcher...Guy's never been my fav, but he's certainly jovial, entertaining, & creative...and that shows in his restaurant & menu.\n\nThere was a wait when we arrived for linner about 4pm...just roll on over to the secksy azz bar: full menu served, great drinks, & hot nice service! Our absolute fav was a cocktail with Jameson, mint, & other goodness....sooo refreshing & a taste bud pleaser! Get it!\n\nWe shared the Guy-talian fondue (or...Guy-Taliban as my autocorrect keeps saying...lol!). Absolutely ingenious! Long pretzel sticks wrapped in greasy yummy salami...dunk it in the cheese sauce (meh). The star? Besides the salami....the peppercinis! I'm not a big fan but these ones were superb: crunchy, spicy, perfect. \n\nWe also got the spicy wings...wings were meh, but the blue cheese wasabi sauce was like foreplay, y'all. Dip the crunchy fresh veggies on the side into it, slather the wings in it, don't waste it!\n\nI've NEVER observed SO many burgers leaving a kitchen, seriously. Look good, must be good. About 3/4 of the plates leaving the kitchen are burgers. \n\nI'd return next time I'm in Vegas! Kudos, Guy!"
1,I went there for my first date. The service was wonderful. The steak was also wonderful and I love love love their frites. I would definitely visit agaib
0,I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody unless you like getting the stomach pump in the hospital and the shits for a week first time and last time I Went To That hole I had the curry goat with rice lunch special  their were more bones and fat then meat in the dish. Then the meat was very dry and very oily and the rice had a fishy aftertaste and the vegetables were semi frozen in the sauce. Never again .
1,Michelle did a great job cleaning my place for the next renter. She was very polite and was on time for our appointment. I will definatley be using her services in the future.
0,"Decor : This place is very trendy, minimalist decor (which I like) and has a lot character. A hidden gem. \n\nFood/Drinks : Drink selection is good and the snacks are good (I liked the tuna sashimi very much).\n\nService : I must say that the staff is very stuck up. I had friends from Europe and the tab was quite a large one. They were rude to myself and other people from my group and I personally think that that alone would keep me from going back or bringing anyone there.  \n* I must however add that the brunette with the glasses was very nice (nothing outstanding but at least polite) . She is the only exception."
1,"Okay, okay... I KNOW it's a fast food joint. I KNOW it's a chain. HOWEVER, let me tell you, the ladies who work there are AMAZING. Their customer service is top notch. The store is always exceedingly clean. The food...well, it's Carls' Jr. It's the same food you'll get at any Carl's Jr. But, the staff at THIS one makes it truly a pleasure! I was very pleasantly surprised. Good job girls!!"
0,"I've eaten better beef sandwiches in my day.  The flavor wasn't there and it didn't have what I was looking for.  The day we went they had chicken noodle soup and it couldn't have been much worse.  We'll give it another shot the next time we're in town, but not a good first impression."
1,"\u00c8 il pi\u00f9 rinomato per la poutine a Montr\u00e9al e si conferma essere in assoluto il pi\u00f9 fornito della citt\u00e0, con un men\u00f9 da leccarsi i baffi. Io ho assaggiato la tradizionale e la porzione mi ha impressionato! Buoni gli ingredienti, gentile il personale e carinissimo l'ambiente.\nAssolutamente consigliato, anche se vi aspetta una fila di 15 minuti per entrare.\n\nPS. Buona scelta di birre artigianali"
1,"What a fabulous venue for yet another fabulous yelp event. From the valet to the restrooms. From the vast modern space to impressive and friendly service. \nAnd the food! Oy Ve (that's Japanese for yummy)...\nIka Furai\nAge Watari Gani\nAbura Bouzo No Tataki Shiro Asparagus Zoe\nButaniku To Hotate No Gyoza\nYakitori-Negima Yaki\n\nOK. Admit it. You know asparagus. But what about the rest? Well, you'll have to check out Roka Akor to find out. Cuz I'm not spilling it. My fave was the Abura Bouzo. Buttah! Like a big stick of buttah! I could have chowed down several more. And then several more. Light and airy with clean lines and muted tones, this is contemporary asian at its best. \n\nOrigato. Dori Ori Gato Mr. Roboto."
1,"they plated my wife's ring and polished it for minimal cost. Upon completion we picked it up and noticed that a diamond was missing. When we called them they did not question a thing, simply had us return to get a new diamond put in at no cost. Selection is great, service is stellar, and I will be there for each piece of jewelery i need moving foward."
0,"I booked a room at Bill's because of the Yelp reviews. They said it was clean, comfy and got the job done. Too bad I will never know how Bill's actually is because they booted me over to the Imperial Palace (*Note: Bill's=4 starts, IP=2.5 stars, yet I had to pay the same price.)\n\nWe had arrived in Vegas early but didn't want to pay to check in early, so we waited until the ridiculously late 4 pm check-in time. When we got there, they told us that they would be moving us to the Imperial Palace. No explanation, no nothing. So after about 10 minutes of questioning Carletta at the front desk, she told us that it was because there were plumbing problems. But who knows.... Anyways, Carletta was kind enough to give us some wrong directions, so it took us about 30 minutes to get to the IP, which we could have walked in 5. But the awesomeness was just getting started!\n\nLet me just say that the IP was nothing short of awful. I mean, it got the job done (as in, we weren't sleeping on the street...which might actually have been cleaner), but the room was dirty, TERRIBLE lighting (how are 7 girls supposed to get ready in a room with 2 dull lamps?), the staff was extremely rude and unhelpful, and I had to wait 15 minutes to check in and 30 minutes to check out (Not including the time I spent figuring out that they checked someone else out instead of us and going back to have it fixed). Because of this dilemma they upgraded us to a room reserved for Diamond Club members. What special amenities did this \""upgraded\"" room have? A coffee pot.....thanks......\n\nAnyways, there was a problem with my bill, so I called Bill's and was on hold for about 10 minutes. Then someone answered the phone and promptly hung up once I said hello. \n\nI am debating whether or not to even call to complain or try to get a partial refund because I doubt they will give a crap. It's nice that other people had such wonderful stays at Bill's, but I for one would suggest that you don't risk it. Yes it might be clean and comfortable and cheap(-ish), but wouldn't you rather stay somewhere where you'll actually be taken care of?"
0,"Second time at RCP:, and the last.  The first time just after they opened - limited menu, the wine I ordered was not in stock.  Understandable as they just opened.  As locals we were really looking forward to this restaurant providing another dining option downtown.  So we gave it a second try a few months later.\n\nWORSE than the first time... !  Still the wine was not in stock and the beer we ordered was  not available.  Then waiting for the beer was painful  We could see the beautiful bar tender tending to everything except getting our beer as well as the beer for the adjacent table.  They ordered before we did.  The pizza quality was less than average.  I ordered a slice with peperoni and jalapeno.  The jalapeno looked as though it was thrown on the pizza as an afterthought.  It was not cooked into the pizza.\n\nThen the exit, the wine that was not in stock had been charged to our bill, which required the manager to remove before we could pay with a credit card.  Wait, wait....wait.   No manager, no nothing...  Where does this manager hang out during lunch?  I offered to pay with cash and was told the manager still needed to remove the charge.  We gave them enough cash to cover the costs and left.\n\nIt seemed as a bother to the staff that we were there.  Too bad, we were really hoping for another eatery.  We will not be back!"
1,"What can I say? Dilly's Deli is a classic in the Tempe area. Awesome place to get a delicious sandwich for a descent price and be able to get in and out fairly quickly.\n\nI personally like the gobbler. Great taste of Thanksgiving without the \""I ate WAY too much\"" feeling."
1,"Is it possible to go to the desert and have the best sushi ever? I kept asking myself that same question on Saturday night while I enjoyed every plate of sashimi that was served.  \n\nWe didn't have resos, so I thought if we showed up early they would seat us.  We were lucky and grabbed 2 seats at the bar, so we could watch the preparation of everything wonderful we were about to experience.\n\nOur waiter suggested that we order about 4-6 dishes and we started out with 4 and of course, ordered more later:)  \nHamachi with citrus to start was perfect- just enough  grapefruit to perfectly offset the hamachi with avocado and cilantro.\nTako and tomato- was such a pleasant surprise!  Who would have thought fresh mozzarella, octopus and an organic tomato would be such a great mix?\nBig Eye Tuna sashimi- I could have ordered another 5 plates of this!  It was completely delicious and smooth at the same time.  \nSaikyo Yaki- Miso cooked cod- How can you resist? You can't!\n\nThe best quality about Sea Saw is fresh wasabi!  I've only seen wasabi made once and that was on Martha Stewart Show.  \n\nIt's such a treat to have this tiny restaurant take all the extra steps to make your dinner so good and so special.\n\nI'll definitely be back. Chef Nobu and his team made such an impression and everything was so wonderful.  Yes, this is the best sushi and yes, I did travel to the desert for it!"
0,"I have been to this restaurant dozens of times throughout the years. I find the steaks are always good, but the seafood is really hit or miss. Was there yesterday and my lobster was totally over cooked. It was like complete rubber. It was barely edible. I should have known better to order it there, but I love surf and turf so I gave it a shot. Very disappointing."
0,"We used to consider going to Pan Asia as a treat, one of our \""go to\"" places.  We LOVED the fact that they had a \""special\"" menu on Saturday night that allowed the two of us to eat at least 2 rolls and an order of crab puffs for $20.  It's almost like once they deep 6'd that, the rest of the experience went downhill with it.  But it was still good enough so we were still going.  \n\nUntil last week.  We were there about 10 minutes after they opened on Friday and I had to use the restroom.  It stunk like garbage and rotting fish in the bathroom, which coincidentally had had a garbage can propping it open to air it out.  \n\nWe ordered 3 small salads, 2 rolls (one was cooked), and 1 order of chicken potstickers.  When our water arrived, two out of our three glasses had dead gnats floating in them.  When we told the server she made no apology, just looked at the glasses as she walked off and returned with two \""new\"" glasses.  Only difference was these had lemon in them and our original waters did not.  The chicken potstickers arrived a good 10 minutes before our rolls did and the server didn't apologize for the wait or let us know when the rolls were almost done.  By this point, I was almost afraid of what would happen once I did eat my sushi roll!  But I did and it was tasty, yet I was still disgusted.  $50 for that horrible experience.  Unfortunately, we had a friend with us who was in town for a visit and we were embarrassed that we had told her how much we loved this place.  Add Pan Asia to the Never Again list!"
0,"I was there today after 1:00 with very few people in the establishment. There wasn't a clean table in the entire restaurant. Further, there was food on the floor and it was downright filthy. After asking for a table to be cleaned so my friend and I could sit and eat, the cashier very lazily slopped a wet towel on a table and threw the trash from the table onto the floor. While the food is OK, this place needs management desperately! Will never return!"
0,"How backward must a local channel be, to have the rights to broadcasting the biggest television event in America, and not be able to stream weather warnings across the bottom of the screen without interrupting the HD signal?\n\nAnd just for the record, I don't give a rat's ass that there is winter storm warning in Northern Arizona, and even if I did it wouldn't matter since I'm busy staying indoors, watching the Super Bowl.\n\nA station this awful should really be the partner of NBC so we could lump everything that is terrible about major network television together with the hokey, backwoods morons at channel 10."
1,"I love this place it is down the street from where I live and it is definitely old school Mexican food. I like it, The place has not been around for 39 years for nothing. I love the green chimi. I have now been there 3 times in two weeks. I love family owned businesses and hate going to chains. So this fills the bill perfectly"
1,"They don't do reservations but they do call aheads which is basically a reservation. Small but cute so be prepared to sit outside. If you're not use to a lot of true Italian ingredients you may get lost in the menu...BUT the staff is super friendly and will help you understand. Food was quite good. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 was the atmosphere of workers not quite sure what to do. Party of 7, no seating... Where do we sit them? At the bar. Where did walk carry out customer go.. I don't know. Who fills the ice? Apprehensive about asking who gets bill. It just seemed like they were brand new.. Maybe they were. Overall good place to eat!"
0,Unfortunately China China Restaurant is no longer there. It's now China Buffet and I would NEVER come back here. The only thing edible was their cut oranges. So we basically paid $8.95 for a plate full of oranges. I'm fearfully of how my stomach is going to be tonight...
1,"I am a fan of Ice Cream! There is really no other place near me (that I know of) that is a good place to go and just get Ice Cream (yogurt aside), so that is why I am reviewing a Cold Stone!  I really do like their Ice Cream too!  I always get the cheesecake fantasy or whatever its called, but it is by far my favorite!  We come here and it is always good, service is always the same, the place is clean and there is never a wait (or a long wait)  I love the creations they have and my kids love em too."
1,"Sushi Samba was the perfect spot to fill up on tasty food after a quick shopping spree at The Shoppes at The Palazzo with my fashionista girlfriend. We went straight for the $16 Chilean seabass bento box, which was the best deal on the lunch menu. It came with miso soup, field green salad, tuna roll and oshinko pickles. \n\nThe three skewers of miso glazed seabass, along with all the sides, was a nice amount of food (though could've been a little small for a big appetite), but I seriously could have eaten three more skewers. The seabass was amazing! That miso marinade was to die for. I suppose I could've gotten the entree portion, but for lunch, it was perfect. Plus, $29 is a bit much to spend on a lunch entree. There were six tuna rolls, so that also made the bento filling.\n\nThe funky decor was really cool, and reminded me a little of Blowfish in the bay area -- but much bigger and with Latin influences intertwined. The staff was awesome, and the food came out quick. We were in and out in a flash, and back to the pool before our guys even missed us."
0,"Bad food, buffet is for $14 and my statement had a charge of $20, my friend had the same charge. \nFood was cold and not indian"
0,"We will not be going back to Healing Hearts Pediatrics.\n\nI have been taking my son to Healing Hearts since we moved to Arizona about a year and a half ago.  The Wellness Check visits have all been fine, scheduled months in advance, but whenever he's sick, we can't get him in.\n\nOne time, he was running a fever and throwing up and we called for a same day appointment.  We were told that they didn't have any appointments for another few days but that if his temperature went over 103 we should take him to the ER.  That night, at about 3am, his temperature went to 104 so we took him to the hospital.  Our final bill from the ER was just over $2,000.00 for some Tylenol suppositories.  If Healing Hearts had seen him that day, we wouldn't have had that bill or the trip to the ER at 3am.\n\nToday, he was running a fever and I thought, \""I won't even call to ask, I'll just show up.\""  I got my son to their Gilbert office at 8am (right when they open) and told them we didn't have an appointment.  The receptionist said, \""Oh, we don't take walk ins.\""  She did offer me a 9:30am appointment but by that time I was done and did not take the appointment that would make me sit in the waiting room with a sick two-year old for another hour and a half.\n\nI asked if the office manager was available and I was told that she worked at the Chandler office.  So, I drove to the Chandler office.\n\nWhen I went up to the counter the receptionist asked if I had an appointment.  I said no, but that I was looking for Mary Ann.  The receptionist asked, \""Were you just at the Gilbert office?\""  I said that I was and she told me Mary Ann would be out in just a moment.\n\nMary Ann came out to the lobby quickly and listened to my frustration.  After I explained our $2,000.00 Tylenol from the last time and that I was unhappy they did not offer same day sick appointments she said, \""The other office did offer you a 9:30am appointment.  We're very busy this time of year so a 9:30am appointment is pretty amazing to find for today.\""  Basically, I should feel lucky they were willing to squeeze me in.\n\nI told her that the Urgent Care was more his primary doctor at this point than his primary doctor was because whenever he's sick I can't seem to get him in, but when he's well, we have no problems.  She explained to me that wellness appointments are usually made months in advance so that why they are easier to get.\n\nIsn't that the whole point Mary Ann?  In order to see a doctor at Healing Hearts, you need to schedule your appointment months in advance and you should feel lucky that they are willing to see you.\n\nDo not use this doctor's office; when you really need them, they will not care about you and will not see you.  I'm going to find a pediatrician who actually cares about the health of my son and not just the number of dollar signs they can make appointments for in a day."
1,"So Katie H. is pretty dead on with the atmosphere and the lack of conversation --  a tad dingy on the inside, and only one of the girls could speak decent English; however, I don't remember the last time I cared much about the decor in a nail salon or whether or not my technician wanted to carry on some BS chit chat.  You can have crappy art on the wall, and you can only say hello for all I care, as long as you do a good job.  I was a little bummed that I walked in right after 4 other people, which meant I was the girl waiting with her feet in luke-warm water for 30 minutes.  Honestly though, it was worth the wait.  I had the only male in the place, and he was so apologetic that I had to wait - I think he may have been even more particular based on that (?) who knows.  Either way, he did an awesome job.  I'm still admiring my nails and toes today (got them done yesterday) thinking \""wow!\""  I think what's even better than my fab Cajun Shrimp-colored nails is the fact that it only cost me $35 dollars for both the mani and the pedi.  Scottsdale is super expensive almost all around, but this nail place isn't gipping anyone on their service.  I'm excited to go back, and I'm crossing my fingers I get the guy again!\n\nFYI - they prefer tips in cash but will accept it on a debit."
1,"I give the Southpoint hotel five stars, as the hidden gem off the strip.  Yet it is not too far away; if you have a car or take the shuttle.  Not to mention very close to the outlet mall (love shopping).\n\nIt is super family friendly with the arcade, movie theatre, bowling alley and cheap eats (in addition to many nice restaurants). The steak house and Italian restaurant are both fabulous!\n\nWe've stayed at the Southpoint many times and always have a great experience!"
1,for the price it is really worth it! great diner and friendly staff too ! yes as many said its a grease hole but the food is good that is what's important no?
1,"I visited Mimi's once a couple years ago and fell in love. But then I moved away from the area and never returned until yesterday! \n\nSince my first visit they've expanded. Before it was a bit cramped, especially as they're so popular and always packed. So now the tables are more spread out it has a lovely atmosphere. \n\nI had a cappuccino and a mint Aero slice, both were delicious! I have never heard a bad thing about their cakes, they look beautiful and taste amazing! I get tempted by their photos everyday when they post them on Facebook.\n\nThey also have an alcohol licence so this seems to be a popular place for hen dos, afternoon tea and a bottle of bubbly, sounds good to me! :)"
0,"We did not have a good experience here. The food was bland and the quality of the ingredients was low.  The server was slow and when we got the food to go sauce leaked out if the bag creating a massive mess. The containers just weren't able to hold all that bland flavor.\n\nIf a one star rating doesn't tell you to skip it, I don't know what will."
0,If this is what Mr Keller puts his name on he needs to maybe eat here one time. I would rather go to Red Robin than go back here. A medium rare burger that was brown all the way through and sweet potato fries that had sat under a light for who knows how long. 100% tourist trap Oh and the service Sucks too......
1,"First off, putting this place up to the standards of the other hotels on the strip is just illogical - it's like comparing a $4.99 steak to a steak at Mastro's. This place is just fun, and if you're looking to have a low-budget night out on the strip that doesn't involve bourgeoisie bars or clubs, I'd say Oshea's is worth a visit.\n\nA couple Cliff Notes:\n1) Low limit tables - $5 blackjack! \n2) Beer Pong tables - pretty legit set up of pong tables, about 8 of them. You can buy a pong set-up from the bar (2 pitchers of beer, 2 pong balls, 2 water-wash cups, and 20 plastic cups) for $23!"
1,"Fantastic.  Just fantastic.\n\nI came here during dinnertime specifically for the BBQ.  I was told there was a wait time for indoor seating, but I could sit at the outside tables for immediate service.  The decision seemed rather obvious.  It was moderately hot out, but not so bad in the shade.  I placed my order and within 5 minutes was served.  I got the full rack of ribs (after reading all the reviews that recommended it), and I'm glad I did.  It was delicioso, and tasted even better with the BBQ sauce.  All for only $15.\n\nThis place's only fatal flaw?\n\nThe lack of sides.  No baked potato, no french fries, no mashed potatoes.  I've never had BBQ without some sort of spud before.  The plate is served with cole slaw, chili, corn on the cob and bread and butter, though.  But with no option for french fries, I left feeling oddly...unfinished.  (Granted, it took me into half the ribs to realize the lack of it!)\n\nGreat ribs.  Great value.  Not so great choice of sides.\n\nBut it comes highly recommended from this dude."
1,"Don't judge a book by its cover. I chuckled a bit when I first saw the place; it honestly looks like a biker bar from the outside. However, the inside is very spacious and clean. Megan, the manager, is very nice and does whatever she can to keep the atmosphere as good as possible. There are many different types of people who come here. The beer selection is excellent, and the liquor selection is second to none. Give this place a try; you won't regret it!"
0,Horrible rip off had weekly service they didn't show up a few times... You know the Times you really need them to... Made me pre pay and the last time they no showed me I said refund  and cancel service...that never happened so I had two previous reviews one good one bad I decided to sell my house I called Agnes the owner said I would take down the bad review if they would come clean and never mind the refund she sent out two people who seemed to have never cleaned in their life they did hardly any thing mind you I had paid them! After two hours (I was promised three people three hours) two people I said good job you can leave more like just leave but the couple was nice just had no idea and I spent the next four hours doing everything myself thanks for nothing!
0,"Food was decent , but the wait staff was extremely unprofessional as well as slow. Which is weird considering there was only 4 customers total in the restaurant and nearly 12 wait staff.   It took nearly 20 minutes to receive our drinks ( should have been a warning sign ).   We will probably never return.   This Tony Romas was nothing like the California ones im used to."
0,"Sorely disappointed.  \n\nI used to be a fan, but this barely half-full(at high noon on a Monday!) restaurant just doesn't cut it anymore. \n\nWait staff was sub-par, food was average, and the prices still conveyed the idea that the management thought they were awesome.\n\nParking is a royal pain in the butt -- and has clearly had an effect on other nearby businesses.  (This part is no fault of Uno's as far as I know).\n\nIf given a choice for a tasty business lunch, look elsewhere."
0,"The meal came with samosas which were not on the menu, but really, really tasty.  You get one with each meal as well as a small salad. \n\nThe samosa was the best part of the meal by far. The meal size is nice for the amount you pay and very reasonable (not a lot, but not nothing either).  But the food is just incredibly bland.  Making something spicy-hot won't cover the fact that the spice blends that should be there just aren't (or if they are, they just don't pop).\n\nWe got delivery and we won't eat from here again."
0,"Horrible service. Never anyone in there and the owner charged me more money for request no onions !!! Wtf!!!! Any didn't even tell me and charged me !!!! Never going back!!!!!!!!! So much  worst lo mein , shrimp is super hard and so much sprouts barely any noodles !"
0,"Horrendous service, smokey, could be a comfy nook.\n\nMe and my brother walked in here late one night for a night cap, the place had about 12 other people already there, so not crowded nor empty. We sat up at the bar, and things went downhill from there. My brother ordered a cream ale and I ordered a Knob Creek bourbon on the rocks. The bar tender told my brother he probably wouldn't like the cream ale (??? wtf?) my brother insisted, and the bar tender said \""fine. suit yourself\"" (the beer tasted great, btw... no idea what the bar tender was thinking). Between serving my brother and then serving me, the bar tender went over to a group of his friends on teh other side of the bar, and had shots with them.\n\nFinally, the guy came over and told me my bourbon would be 9 bucks... a little steep, but, whatevs, I was in full tourist mode and was simply there to drop a few toonies... so i nodded, no problem. He served it to me in a small shot glass, no ice. I reminded the guy that I'd like it on the rocks... so he poured it over ice and then told me it would be 11 bucks... i asked him indignantly, for the ice? and then he had some difficulty explaining to me something about the size of the glass (and this guy was anglo, so i'm not talking translation problems here)... i kept asking him if it meant he poured MORE bourbon into the glass, and he wouldn't answer me straight - though my brother seemed to think he had topped up my glass since a shot looks a bit short over ice, i guess. not sure what happened, but now me, my brother, and the bar tender were all on very disgruntled terms.\n\nobviously we rubbed this guy the wrong way, no idea why, but as soon as we were finished with the drinks, we were out of there faster than you could cry sacre bleu! too bad, cuz the space is cavernous and comfy, could be a really great place to hide form the weather if the service didn't suck so much."
1,"So here we are, Tuesday night dinner and I'm not really hungry.  I mean I've normally got a healthy appetite (healthy appetite -you know, something more than just a salad or a nibble of something)  but tonight I'm not so hungry so I ask if I can split a quesadilla with hubby.   Steak please.  He comes home with that thing and at first I'm thinking this isn't right cuz the container is too light.  Yes I know a tortilla, cheese, and beef really shouldn't weigh a lot.  Don't ask me what I was thinking.  Besides, by then it was probably my stomach talking.\nOpened it up and revealed the toasty, fragrant tortilla with Mexican cheese and chunks of beef.  *inhale*  A small nibble and my taste buds were telling me to stop multi tasking and just eat.  The tortilla was darn near perfect tonight.  The cheese was buttery, and not too much either.  And the ideal amount of tender beef was included.  The green salsa caught me by surprise tonight.  A little fire there.  I used almost an entire bullet for a half of my meal.  I don't understand, I really wasn't that Hungry tonight.\nI still had to have some red salsa.  I was torn.  The quesadilla was delicious by itself.  Warm, toasty tortilla with cheese and beef.   Mmm mmm.\nAnd here I wasn't very hungry.\nThis place is consistently good.  \nFresh salsas.\nGreen Chile Burritos.\nBreakfast Burritos.\nThin, crispy, tortilla chips.\nAnd the staff is courteous,  knowledgeable,  and have been pleasant every time I've been there.\nIt all keeps me (us) coming back for more."
1,"This was very special. It is hard to find a truly great Tres Leches in the states, so you cannot leave here without dessert. It melted on your mouth, and the cake was so tender while the cream decorations were real whipped heavy cream, the cake touched with little flecks of temptations.\nYes, we did actually eat a meal :). I had the Salmon topped with a compote of Tomatoes that was flavorful and piquant. It was accompanied by Grilled Veggies.\nMy BFFs also had imaginative and mouth watering entrees. I loved the Malbec. The redecoration of the former 'Brixxs' location includes beautiful dark wood and very private booths as well as an expanded outdoor patio area. A simply wonderful experience!!!"
1,"This is hands down the most expensive dinner my husband and I have ever had and we don't regret a single dime of it.  We decided to splurge and be adventurous and go with the chef's tasting menu, basically a 7-9 course dinner with whatever the chef decides to serve us, with wine pairings for my husband.  \n\nWe had 9 courses and these are some of them.  Keep in mind my description does not do the meal any justice.  \nAvocado ball with dungeness crabmeat inside with watermelon gazpacho.\nTuna tartare\nTruffed onion soup\nHamachi with shitake mushroom\nLamb\nChocolate souffle with dark chocolate sauce\n\nMy husband said the wine choices were absolutely perfect with each course.  Our server, Javier was fun and friendly.  In the end, they took us back to the kitchen to show us around and to meet Chef Keller.  He was very friendly and was able to chat with us for a bit.  Part of the dinner was also 2 autographed cookbooks that he authored.  \n\nI highly recommend the restaurant for a special dinner.  They do 3, 4 or 6 course dinners in addition to the chef's choice that we chose."
1,"I don't know why people gave this buffet resto low ratings? Do you guys really know good food? I'm a food lover(foodholic) & I always love to try to go to different restaurants just to try it( food adventure is fun ) I love exploring different kind of cuisines. So I guess for me I really like Lin's because of its affordable price, nice atmosphere & it's clean. I can't say it's the best Chinese buffet or food that I've ever tried but it's good."
0,"Checked out this place from the groupon last night. Friday night at 750 most tables were full ONE server. ordered our food, the the wings that were small and undercooked with generic sauce. got some garlic bread that we did enjoy. we had our drinks and all 3 cups were empty with some ice and I put them at the end of the table hoping the ONE server would notice, we had to call her over for refills, she said for which ones...... (I should have said only the EMPTY ones) ALL of our dishes from the garlic bread and wings sat on the table the ENTIRE time. we ordered the White pizza and realized when we got it there was no ricotta on it. I didnt want to complain I was tired of this place. The table behind us never had their pizza put in and they sat after us, and barely got their pizza as we were talking out the door. OIL everywhere on the pizza. That should not happen with white pizza. Here is the kicker, from about 820pm (FRIDAY NIGHT) they turned away 3 groups of people because \""they had NOTHING left in the kitchen\"" Really? you put out a groupon not preparing for the influx of customers?!?!??! Those people will NEVER come back when a pizza place is OUT OF FOOD at 845. such an embarressment. Will not come back again"
0,"This place is gross.  The tables are not clean and the staff is rude.  I watched them wipe thier nose and then touch my foood.  When I questioned this the manager said that the germs will \""cook off\"".  I left with trying thier food."
0,Only had sales side experience here ...and do they have sales experience! This is my 7th BMW purchase and the first and last from this dealership - total up-sell - finance department from Hell .... only upside is a nice car that I will be taking for service at Penske - not going to chance a another roll of the dice.
1,"Ahead of the curve! \n\nI hate getting haircuts so I reverted to giving my own to save the pain and hassle!\n\nPoint being said I enjoy coming here. The crew they have are experts, creatively ground breaking in not just the way they cut hair but the way they setup their shop and the way they serve the community. \n\nThe shop is simplistically built with the mind set of less is more. The art setup around the shop compliments the the shops negative space and gives the look of being in a different city than the one outside. \n\nWhen you're done with your haircut you might get the feeling of being in a magazine shoot. Being in a shop that has many spots to take your picture of your hair and a sheik background. \n\nThis place not only offers haircuts but offers a gallery for artists around the valley. On some nights( like first Fridays) the shop turns into a whole different venue/gallery. This is a place to find the best artists around the valley that may seem hidden to the naked eye. \n\nAs you can tell I found my niche of hair salons and I look forward to being  a regular; also looking forward to not giving my self haircuts and bad ones for that matter."
0,"We have visited this location many times over the past year and dropped a LOT of money here. Consistently BAD service.  They never have Iced Tea in the metal containers (even though they will try and sell you some and then do a bait and switch and offer some other drink).  We watch the manager sitting off at a side table playing on her cell phone.  The help seems to always be in a state of oblivion and moving at half speed.  Bagel bins are typically empty and not restocked by early afternoon. And the floor is always dirty with pieces of food, wrappers, etc. laying around.  The help at this store (both male and female) need a commando type manager here to kick some proverbial a___ and get these 18 to 24 year olds to care, clean up, and restock ice tea containers.  General lack of caring. The shift manager needs to get off her phone.  I hope the owner reads this, but who knows, maybe they are behind this lack of caring.  Generally a slip shod operation.  And oh yeah - it is hot.  Mr. owner FIX your AC once and for all."
1,"Recently celebrated my anniversary at Chima's.  We wanted a bread from the norm and Chima's did not disappoint.  The service was top notch!  All the cuts of meat were excellently prepared and tasted fabulous.  The buffet was very well appointed and included some of our favorites like Beef Carpaccio and excellent Black Beans and Rice.  Only criticisms would be that the venue is quite loud and hectic...so if your looking for a quite dinner for two this may not be the best pick, but I could see how it would be an excellent vibe an energy for dinner with friends."
0,"Got a cheap deal and decided to stay here... now I realize why it was cheap.\n\nThis review is purely on the hotel room we got.\nWhen we checked in, it took a very long time, even though there was 5 different people working and only 2 of which were actually checking in customers. No worries, I am a patient lady and I am also in no rush. We checked in and the receptionist gave us our key and we were on our way.\n\nWe got a room with a lovely view of... the hotel's air conditioner unit. No big, I didn't pay much for the room.\nI started to unpack because the drive had been so long and I just wanted to sit on the bed. I got my things settled and then took my shoes and socks off and then walked over to my bed when I stepped on.... something. No clue what it was. It was very brown and very sticky. Okay- note to self, don't walk by the left side of the bed without shoes on.\nMy friend and I started to change and get dressed for a night out. I walked over to grab my bag when, a large, metal, panel for the electrical unit in the room fell on me. Literally fell and hit me in the back. I thought I had done it but when I tried to put it back, I realized, there weren't any screws in it except for one... which had ALSO come loose. I decided to call front desk to make sure we don't get charged for this and to be honest, I was kind of expecting an apology. Nothing. I told the lady who picked up what had happened and she laughed and said, \""Don't worry about it. Thanks\""\n\nLuckily, I only spent one night there otherwise, I would have been a bit peeved that I had spent ANY money on this place."
1,Was walking by this place one night with the hubby when I saw the outside guest eating some calimari.  It looked so tasty that we had to go and have some.  SO glad that we did.  Not only was the calimari very good but the lobster bisque was good as well.  Wish that it had bigger pices of lobster in it but still very tasty.  \nMy raspberry mojito was ok.  Raspberry flavor was very weak.
1,"Huge, always busy, tons of tables, lots of action, very open with very tall ceilings, what's not to like? Bonus, the escalator to TAO is right next to the poker room....refreshing scenery after staring at ugly mugs for hours. Its a must go poker room. No bonuses but great perks for having a Grazia players card. I give it 4 out of 5 stars just because I don't find the dealers to be as friendly as some other poker rooms, but then again they are extremely busy and deal with a lot of sh*t from the huge amount of players. \n\nDude you know you can't use a computer at the table, no you cant take pictures, and no I don't care how much you won online last week......every kid says he won 10 grand last week online....sure.  Oh, and if you are falling asleep at the table, go home. If you're drunk, please come take a seat!"
0,"I have to say this is the worst $150 we spent in our entire life. The show may be good in early 2000s, but can't make me excited in 2013. Any circus show on Asian TV programs may be better than this. Sorry I just don't get it."
0,"Took my dog there for knee surgery and had the absolute worst experience I've ever had in all my years related to the care of pets, and I've had a lot of them.  Whoever prepped my dog for surgery burned his leg with the shaver (must have been a very dull blade), then wrapped it without telling me of any issues.  How could the surgeon not have noticed this?  My dog was in such discomfort that I kept him drugged...little did I know about the sores as I was told to under no circumstances to remove the bandage.  I was also told to keep him in a kennel for six weeks, no exercise and no therapy.  There were no follow up calls from the hospital or surgeon until 10 days after surgery when a technician called and didn't know anything and didn't listen to anything I said. It was a very odd conversation.  I took the dog back to have his leg bandaged again as it was slipping. They wouldn't let me go back with him even though he was so frightened of the place that he was shaking all over and I thought he needed my support.  When we got home the normally laid back, sweet dog was going nuts so I removed the bandage to find his leg literally covered with horrible sores and burns.  No one said anything after they bandaged it but what a nice dog he is.  Nothing about the sores!!!  I was so furious I couldn't even talk.  Here my dog had been suffering for weeks for absolutely no reason.  The only time the surgeon even bothered to check on the dog was after I refused to make any more follow-up visits (they charge extra for follow-up exams after surgery!  What?? That should have been included.) and let them know that his other knee would be done elsewhere.  The surgeon said that he would tell the corporation that I wasn't happy.  Really?  Absolute worst experience."
1,"I love coffee and any place that serves it. Shadyside is one of my favorite neighborhoods in the city, especially on a Saturday afternoon. It's very alive and animated with people everywhere! I personally love window shopping at the Apple Store, but that's a different story. \n\nMy girlfriends and I met on Saturday for a little shopping and lunch, and while we were waiting for our one friend, we hopped into the Coffee Tree for a morning tea. They have an awesome tea selection, and I had their organic citrus green tea. The layout is great inside - a lot of tables, and outlets for the laptop users. Up one level, they have couches by a fireplace, and finally in the back they have a closed-in meeting room available for groups. Great location - great tea. It was perfect for the brisk, sunny Saturday morning walk down Walnut."
0,"Soggy overpriced fast food burger with allot of hype. When you have to cover the walls with quotes how good your product is, then you have to something to hide."
0,"New to the neighborhood and thought let's give this place a try. Bottom line -we will not be back. Owner-please take note-you need to speed up the service and the kitchen. I consider this a casual restaurant and it took 15 minutes to get a green salad and 50 minutes to get dinner. After waiting almost an hour, we took our dinner home. Now i have lost my appetitite, so maybe we will eat the leftovers tomorrow night. What a waste of time and money. I hate to write bad reviews, owning restaurants myself for 15 years, but please read your reviews and change the way that you are doing business. We would love to find a nice, small, affordable Italian restaurant that one could get dinner in 10-15 minutes. Restaurant is pricey for the simple food fare too."
1,"Charming, unique, great good, good selection of wine. I love sitting outside when the weather is nice. This quaint little house has a warm inviting ambiance.\n\nIt has Dilworth written all over it. The grass fed burgers and Tuna Ahi Salad are the best. The Ahi Tuna salad is the best salad I have ever had -- hands down!"
1,"it was nice that we were in the  heart of downtown. the nice thing the tour buses pick up right there. the front desk staff was knowledgeable and help setup my tours.\nthe room was big and clean. the room had 42 \"" tv . the hotel has parking under garage. but it does cost."
1,"The avocado is mashed,  it makes a great substitute for mayo!\n\nthis subway has excellent service, the staff is always friendly and helpful.  I had the Roast Beef on wheat, and when i at first asked for regular lettuce then changed my mind to spinach leaves, my sandwich pro scraped it off with a smile! I've never been a huge fan of subways bread, its soft and chewy, but lacks a hard outer crust.  The rest of the sandwich was good, and i will definitely be returning"
0,"Disappointing! Turned away without even trying after driving 25 minutes to try for the 1st time. It's 9:15, sign says close at 10p. \""We decided to close early today\"" #FalseAdvertising"
0,"Congratulations OnTrac, you were the business with service so terrible that it finally pushed me over the edge and got me to register an account on here. If there was a zero stars option this company truly deserves it. Like numerous reviews on here, my order was marked as out for delivery and then never showed up. When the package didn't show up by the service commitment time of 8PM, I contacted OnTrac support and was assured that the package was still out for delivery and would still be arriving on my doorstep any minute. Two hours passed and I decided to call again only to find out that delivery was never even attempted and that the package had been rescheduled for the next day. No compensation from OnTrac was offered. \n\nIf you ever see OnTrac as the company responsible for shipping an order you placed on Amazon, cancel it."
1,"I was visiting Vegas this weekend, and stepped into Sunrise this morning before heading home, and just to be clear: this place rocks! Baristas knew their coffee, and we're super friendly, I also loved that they roasted their beans in store. Size of shop was small but still comfortable. I will definitely be returning to this coffee house whenever I find myself in Vegas again. Oh, and my cappuccino was great."
0,"Most things here are great, but the checkout staff is something that needs A LOT of fixing. They are slow, unfriendly, and frankly, shouldn't be in the customer service field if they can't treat a customer LIKE A CUSTOMER. \n\nAnd that doesn't mean kiss a customer's butt while doing your job - just wear a damn smile and say \""Thank You\"" every once in a while."
0,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner, $36.95/person, a TOTAL RIPOFF. \n\nMost of the meat in the carving stations were incredibly dry. The ostrich meat had a great taste to it but all the other meats we tried (kobe top sirloin, pork short ribs) were just dry. \n\nAsian food here should not be touched, the sushi rolls and nigris were incredibly gross, they resembled the sushi you'd get in supermarket packages. Fried rice tasted very americanized. \n\nWaitress was very nice and service was overall excelllent. Everytime I came back to the table, my plates were cleared and my drink refilled. \n\nDessert: So many choices! Tiramisu, chocolate covered strawberries, key lime pie, ice cream, chocolate cake. It was definitely the biggest selection I've seen at a buffet. \n\nI think they should stick to american items because dishes like pasta were great but when it came to say paella (it was mushy = BAD). \n\nI've heard this buffet was better for breakfast/lunch so I\""ll probably come back to give the breakfast and lunch buffet a shot. Till then this place deserves a one star for the excellent service and the dessert selection."
1,Bar Louie is awesome they have friendly servers and great food. Wednesday night $1 beers is the best deal in town!
0,"Ok so major customer service problem, ordered drinks and ask if they would bring them out to us because we are on the patio, two different people said sure, but after waiting a while one of the servers come out and say your drinks are ready......but doesnt bring them out. The 8$ sausage muffin was cold in the middle. Besides that the choco crossiant was good, sausage muffin tasted good even cold. The nutella coffee does not taste good. The shots are only okay but the nutella only tasted like pumps of hazelnut with no sugar. Also ordered a veggie quiche, it was decent not great, definitely not 7.75$\nTotal bill for 3 food items and 2 lattes is over $30 with a bonus of horrible customer service.\nIf you really want food not pastry order from trop smoothie and just get subpar coffee from Sambalatte. Save yourself $20."
1,Love the food - great kebabs! Especially lamb. Raspberry chicken dish - delicious. Service is excellent. Owner is devoted to the quality of food and enjoyment of customers. He is often there to greet customers! Great atmosphere - great music. Great hummus! Oh - and try the dumplings! yum yum!
1,"First off, the four stars is for the food here.  Very close to five stars.  The service though is a a three at best.  Seems like we have been consistently ignored, long waits to see our server, order mistakes and other annoyances.  That being said, the food is so good I keep coming back!  Feed me that BBQ goodness!\n\nRecently came for lunch and they have a good lunch menu, again, service was awful.  Waited too long to see our server, another 10 minutes passed between drink order and food (they weren't busy) and they brought our orders out separately.   Again, food was bomb though lol.  I had the fried chicken sandwich and almost made love to the second half."
0,"Let me start out this review by saying I will NEVER, EVER stay here again. I chose this hotel on a recommendation of a friend. We came to get married and to go to Defcon. Upon arrival, I noticed how generic and tacky all of the decorations were. Then, I had to wait in line for an HOUR to check in. That's exactly what I want to do when I have been on airplane for over seven hours. Then we found out about the resort fee. WHAT RESORT? The pool is small, and plays really really really loud rap music for ten hours a day, so loud in fact, that I could hear it in my room, FOR TEN HOURS A DAY. Since we were in Vegas to get married, we had expensive jewelry with us, so we didn't want to maids to come in the room. We put the jewelry in the safe, and then put the privacy sign on the door. We came back about ten hours later, and the sign was gone, the room was cleaned and the safe wouldnt work. I called security and they had to come and unlock it, which to me, means someone messed with it. I called and complained and they blamed me for not putting the sign up. I KNOW that I put the sign up. The jewelry was still there, but I shouldnt feel unsafe in my hotel room. I would have loved to nap during the day before going out, but I couldnt because of the loud obnoxious rap music coming up from the pool. All of this was nothing though. The night before we left, I was getting ready for bed, and was rearranging the sheets, and FOUND FECES. FECES on the sheets. Like a dried, crusted spot. We didnt have an animal with us, and we are two grown adults. I was so angry. When I called the front desk, they sent a manager upstairs, and she was astonished. They promptly sent someone up to clean our room. HOWEVER. We went downstairs to talk to a manager face to face, and she basically told us that there was nothing for her to do. She was trying to tell me, who just got married and chose to spend our honeymoon in their hotel, that when I find SHIT in my bed, they can't do anything about it. I was so pissed. Luckily, their bar is open 24 hours. I had a drink, and went back up to the room. By then, the housekeeper had cleaned the room. The next morning, we went to check out to come home, and re-told the morning manager what had happened. She was embarrassed, this manager was much nicer. They comped the $120 \""resort\"" fee and our room service. I was glad...because there is no way I would have paid for this stay here.\n\nI would like to repeat again, that I will never, ever stay here again. The food in this hotel is TERRIBLE, the service is TERRIBLE, and the decorations are TERRIBLE. Cheap, tacky and not in that cute Las Vegas tacky way either. They are going to have to do something, because there is no way they will maintain across from the Wynn."
1,"Good restaurants, good shops and a great movie theater. I like coming here to catch the acoustic bands near the Barnes & Noble. The parking and traffic can be a nightmare on the weekends, so just be careful."
1,"Mmmm....grilled vegetable scramble. Do it.\n\nJoe's is amazing. And they are always busy, so if you decide to come in, plan on standing in line for a bit, but rest assured, every minute is worth the delectable tastes that you will encounter on your first bite.\n\nThey also have pancakes that are light, fluffy and YUM. If you are considering visiting here, consider no more and get your booty in for some breakfast!"
1,"excellent food.  had the filet-au poivre--perfect medium rare, with excellent taste.  Paired nicely with a great bordeaux.  Terrific service!"
1,"Best saudi arabian food and best price I have ever sern before, also they have a hooka lounge at the same store it's extremely cheaper than other hooka store. I recommend this restaurant for ever."
1,"I've stayed at this hotel several times and it is my favorite off-strip hotel. \n\nThe Solitaire suite can fit 6 people comfortably. Everything is spacious, bathroom has a whirpool bathtub, and it has a balcony. The pool is both indoor and outdoor, and provides decent eye candy (at least when I was there).\n\nThe staff is also very friendly and accomodating. Upon request (and as long as they have available drivers), they will drive you down to the strip so you don't have to cab it!"
0,"Not at all impressed by the food at India Oven. I've been here a couple of times & it's definitely going downhill. It was never that great to begin with but one huge noticeable change is how they bring out the tandoori chicken when you go for the buffet. Before, they used to serve it on a hot & sizzling fajita platter with onions & lemons & we went there just a couple of days ago and all they brought out was 2 pieces of cold tandoori chicken on a small plate. The chicken itself didn't taste good. As far as the buffet, it's nothing great ... actually, it was not even good. The mango lassi had a weird taste, super tart, almost as though it had gone bad. The two Indian chicken curry options had okay tasting gravy; the chicken was a little slimy though so I didn't eat it. The chilli chicken was not tasty at all, just spicy & it was almost like they had tried to make it Chinese style? The vegetarian options weren't much better either. My date & I were discussing the food as we were eating it & I think I said \""I don't like that\"" enough times that I'm not going to be returning to this restaurant. The only thing I did say that was good, & in my opinion is a huge part of enjoying Indian food, was the garlic naan. Also, the service was on par, even when it was busy. Highly disappointed with my experience, especially when there aren't many Indian restaurants to eat at in the Gilbert area."
0,"this place has a lot of misleading reviews,to be honest I did not like the menu and the idea of someone else making a menu for me with a few questions and then charge a person $30-50. Over priced! \nThe place was cool but seen better places with better food. I suggest those who wants to try this place to look @ their menu and think twice about spending $$$ on a small portion of food."
1,"Really surprised by my experience here. Yes, it is Pizza Express, but the make over with the modern d\u00e9cor and pretty comfortable chairs, then I was happy to dine here and what is more, I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe new gluten free options means that I had choice here and I thought the pizza was pretty yummy. It is a standard base used - no options on size and thickness but it is thin and crispy, with the right amount of crunch. There are a good range of toppings available (sadly no Sloppy Giuseppe) and my la Reina was tasty and well covered with toppings.\n\nA nice addition is the mini bites with coffee. Dessert is available but you can also get coffee with a range of mini desserts when you want something sweet but can't face a full dessert. There is an option of a gluten free brownie and despite my brownie fatigue, it was really good and just enough to round off a meal.\n\nSo as Claire C has mentioned, there's deals aplenty for Pizza Express so its worth checking before heading here but for tasty food, good service and nice surroundings then it is worth a visit. And for sunny nights, the outdoor seating at The Shore is lovely."
0,"New to vaping. From out of town. Wanted to see what was up with the Vegas vaping scene. Not much from the looks and attitudes in this store. As I walk through the door I was there 10 minutes with out any type of greeting. NONE. They have 3 seats at the tasting \""bar\"" all 100 flavors are behind a counter, after the 5th flavor request guy with glasses was so annoyed and inconvenienced and gave an eye roll showing how displeased he was. I bought a few sample flavor bottles and took off. Disappointed. The owner was very nice. Does he not see how rude rude rude his counter guys are?  Don't bother to ask a question. You will most probably get an eye roll. \nThey do mix flavors fresh for you which I thought was very cool. The lady mixing obviously didn't want to be there either. I feel bad, but with this extremely poor customer service I can't imagine they will be able to keep the doors open long."
1,"First time at Jean george ! Can't believe I've never been. Service was excellent steak was cooked perfect. Will def be back again soon. Would have to recommend getting a steak, although the salmon looked delicious!"
0,"No. Ew.\n\nWtc.\n\nYeah sure it's a nice looking place, but take it from a Chinese girl who grew up in a Chinese dense area.\n\nYa don't pay that much money for mediocre food. Nothing and I say nothing about that food was memorable. The only thing about this place that is memorable, the bill.\n\n\nTell me we didn't pay that much for that meal. To this day, please tell me."
1,"Best meal of my life so far, hands down. \n\nWhen 4 out of my 5 best buds fell ill just before the weekend of my 21st birthday, my mom decided that she and I were going to Vegas instead. At first I was bummed that my friends couldn't make it, but what a trip it was, and this meal was the crown jewel. We both had the \""classics\"" tasting menu with wine pairings. \n\nThe service was impeccable from the moment we walked it, the bread was fresh and heavenly, we had a view of the Bellagio pool...and did I mention that the sommelier there is both knowledgeable and HOT? After a few glasses of wine I was debating asking him if he was married...but no, I didn't. Gotta keep it classy in a place like this!\n\nI don't remember each specific dish, but the standout was that Maine Lobster Pot Pie. Dear gods! I was frustrated that I got too full to finish it! So luscious, simple and yet complex at the same time. MM deserves every minute of fame that he's had due to that dish. Totally exquisite."
0,"This school provides no life skills and unless your child is an asset to the school, he is overlooked. There is a college track for students tacking all AP courses who are self driven and want to get onto highly selective colleges.  The rest are assumed will go to an in state school or pvcc. There are so many options and these kids don't have any. They don't know what colleges to look for and graduate with their path chosen. They are I'll prepared when they do graduate because the teachers hand out test prep notes handed out before tests  that are so detailed that none of the history, spanish, or biology books needed to be taken out from under the bed. I'd drag them out but my son would shake his head Nd just look at the test papers his teachers gave him and ace the test. He had absolutely no comprehension of the subject matter and that is how Horizon teaches. These kids don't know how to study and are going to get swallowed at college. I will say drama department and chorus are great but beyond that, unless pvcc is your goal, expect a rough road and money spent on tutors. Better yet , suck up the money and go to Notre Dame or Brophy. Those those kids succeed."
0,"I will not visit your location again.  You do not honor your coupons.  There were two times I gave the register worker a coupon and they were not applied to a drive thru order.  Both times valid coupons were used, and one instance was greeted with negativity and the response that I did not need to use a coupon.  The price on the menu does not include the coupon.  I will not bring my money to your establishment if you do not honor your own advertising."
1,Delicious Steak.... enough said:)   well it's pricey but oh so worth it.
0,"When I lived in Philly, I would occasionally make a 2 am run to Pat's Steaks for a cheesesteak.  Was it the best cheesesteak in Philly? Not even close.  But it was something that you just did.  I'd group Primanti Brothers into the same category.\n\nI'll ignore the sticky surfaces on the table & railing and focus my comments on the food.  My family ordered three sandwiches - pastrami, ham and hot sausage - along with the Smallman St. fries.  The food was delivered fairly quickly and we dug in.  After a few bites, we all came to the same conclusion:  the food was just OK.  My sandwich didn't have any type of flavor to elicit a reaction from my taste buds.  And even with all of the toppings, the fries weren't anything to get excited about.  We actually left the fries unfinished and chose not to take the remnants with us.\n\nThe food wasn't bad and the price was certainly reasonable.  But there wasn't anything there that would make me look forward to another visit in the near future.  Been there, done that.  Do something different on the next trip."
0,"Cupcake Wars, Shmupcake Wars...these cupcakes are too huge and all the butter cream tastes like wax.  I was looking for cupcakes for my 40th birthday party and I'm so glad that I tasted before I ordered."
1,"One of my favorite restaurants. Always good food, mostly always good service, overall an excellent and classy experience. My only complaint, it's always too cold."
0,"This is probably the most \""no frills\"" tanning place I've ever been to.  While I LOVE that they have a VersaSpa spray tan machine, theirs is an older one that doesn't give instructions between sprays...if you've never tanned before, think of it like the episode of Friends where Ross gets sprayed over and over again on one side.\n\nThe staff is hit or miss - some of them are super sweet and helpful, some of them are...well...let's just say...not super sweet and not super helpful...\n\nThe location on Sahara & Decatur is much better!"
0,"Rosa's--Just okay.\n\nThe opening chips and salsa was tasty and bottomless, but the salsa was definitely on the sweet side.  The food overall wasn't that bad, but nothing distinctive.  You get a fairly large plate of Mexifood in a pleasant atmosphere and pretty good service, but the taste is only average.  Frankly, there are a LOT of Taquerias, even Filiberto's at times, that have had better tasting grub than this, especially at the prices that they charge.  They don't charge an excessive amount, but dinner for three here cost over $60 with tip.  The taste of the food wasn't commensurate with the price--just to compare, another meal at the Filiberto's drive-thru in Tempe provided a similar amount of food with a better taste for $25.\n\nWorth the 35 extra dollars to eat in?  No.\nRecommended?  No.\nCrappy?  No, but why not get food you really enjoy for less money elsewhere?"
0,Wanted to write a good review but I couldn't the line was so long!!!!!!!! Went there twice!!!! Sad I really had high expectations
1,"This is a nice place to stop in for drinks, especially if you've been to a show or concert here. The hand crafted cocktails are exquisite. Try the mac and cheese it's excellent. I did also tried the lobster corn dogs, they were ok but not worth the price."
1,"First, a shameful admission. I don't like ice cream.\n\nThose previous five words have gotten me responses ranging from loathing to pity. Gelato, milkshakes, water ice, fro-yo, and other cold concoctions? Fine by me. But I'm utterly apathetic to ice cream. However, there is one, and only one, exception that I've tasted. The sole ice cream I will gladly seek out is Dave and Andy's.\n\nDave and Andy's creation hits all the high marks, from flavor to texture to temperature. The ice cream here truly tastes of what it's supposed to without being overwhelming. Everything has a malty backbone which adds a unique savory sweetness to each flavor. The ice cream here isn't served excessively cold, and the texture is creamy without slickness. The killer waffle cones are homemade and complement the malty sweetness of the flavors very well. Even the low fat yogurt is awesome.\n\nThe lines can get long, but they move fast. Prices are reasonable given the quality, but bring cash. They also make a mean ice cream cake. Stop by and see if it's worth the hype (spoiler alert: it is)."
0,"This bar is no longer O'Aces and is now a PT's... which is pretty surprising because there is a PT's right around the corner on Sunset & Fort Apache... We stopped in because I received a coupon in the mail for BOGO appetizer and thought, what the heck!?!?! Let' s try it out.. We love PT's on Buffalo & 215... But how can 2 places that go by the same name be so different... \n\nIt was 1 day before the Grand Opening but the bartender/server (it was mid-afternoon so she was the only one there) just did not want to be working and was borderline rude.... We had been sitting ready to order for awhile but she never came by even though she saw us looking around. So I then went up to the bar so I could place our order.. she just looked up at me and ignored me. Ughhh.. She finally came around to take our order... When our food came out (chicken nachos & egg rolls) it was room temperature and not tasty at all.. WTF..... \nThe chef came around to ask about the food so I appreciate that but I didn't want to be the girl who complains about the food to the chef while using a BOGO coupon...\n\nLesson learned.. won't be come back to this PT's again...."
1,"I like the Cosmopolitan and during my time here, I've always had a room with a good view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. My first time in Vegas, which was years ago, I stayed at the Bellagio. At the Bellagio my room was basic and cost about $300 that night and didn't have a good view at all. In order to watch the fountain show, I had to actually go outside and view it with a bunch of frumpy tourists. My patience for that type of thing is very limited so I got over it fast. It was really nice to be able to watch the show while having a few drinks on the privacy of my own balcony at The Cosmopolitan. I've additionally stayed at the Wynn, Palms and Palms Place and The Cosmopolitan has them all beat.\n\nThe casino of the Cosmopolitan is nice, are there casinos in Vegas that I find to be more classic? Yes, but the Cosmopolitan is very hip and...cosmopolitan. Due to it being the newest hotel in Vegas, it does draw in a fair amount of trendy people. This hotel is definitely a great place to stay at if you're looking to have a crazy, fun Vegas trip, there is a lot of that energy here.\n\nAdditionally, the pool is amazing because it's complete with a view of Las Vegas unlike the other good hotels (Bellagio, Wynn, etc.) which have pools on the ground level.\n\nMarquee is the dayclub and nightclub at the hotel and definitely one of the better venues for drinking in Vegas. I'm not going to say the crowd is amazing because it's relatively general public, like everything else in Vegas. Essentially, you dress up, wait in a line and get in. I will say, the space is nice and because it is the newest spot in Vegas, you will get a lot of attendance. What I love MOST about Marquee is the staff is extremely accommodating and nice. They go above and beyond to make sure their guests are having a good time and are very attentive. There's a frozen lemonade alcoholic beverage that is AMAZING as well."
1,"Great place, food was a little pricey but that's expected. Drinks were pretty good too.  I had White Russian (drink that is), some appetizers and the beef stroganoff.  Overall...food, drinks, service and ambiance were all outstanding.  I highly recommend giving it a try just for the experience."
1,"After visiting the Dieu De Ciel brew-pub in Montreal, a trip to the actual brewery seemed in order.  It did not disappoint!  As with many breweries here, you can order 6 oz samples.  There were selections here that I had not seen in the city, such as the aphrodisiaque, a delicious cocoa and vanilla stout.  The food was quite good as well.  The meal I ordered (chicken fajita) came with salsa that was delicious!  I ate that right up.  The sandwich was tasty as well and quite oniony.  The menu was completely in French, but the bartender spoke English very well.  We were a bit disappointed that they did not give official tours of the brewery, but it was well worth the trip to sample more of their delicious brews and pick up a few six packs to bring home."
0,"I stayed here three days, and had to make a one-day addition to my reservation several weeks beforehand.  Trying to find a live person was extremely challenging and changing the reservation via the web site was impossible.  It took me several hours to accomplish the small task, but at least I had the opportunity to really get to know their phone tree.  Arriving at the casino, check-in was speedy and service was friendly.  The casino floor looked as new as the other casinos on the strip, but relatively small and uninteresting in comparison.  The rooms themselves and the hallways were dilapidated to the point that the hotel looked abandoned.  Wallpaper was coming off the walls, the carpet was stained and wrinkled, and the ice machine didn't work.  But the rooms were relatively clean although they too looked old.  The staff was very friendly and often greeted me with a friendly \""good morning\"" as I passed them each day.  Of course when I returned home, I had already received a spam email from them.  The good news; it was cheap.  Including resort fees, it was around $48 a night.  An NO, it wasn't worth it."
1,"In my opinion it doesn't get any better than Camp Randall on a brisk Saturday watching the Badgers play.  \n\nThis place has it's own culture to it with all the fans packed in with the sea of red.  It is so fun to see the student section, always rated as the best or most vulgar, do all their cheers.  It adds excitement and keeps you entertained during the game with the 1st and 10 Wisconsin chants and much more.  \n\nOnce you go to a Badger's game here you will know what I am talking about.  Great place for watching football."
0,"I really wanted to love this place but unfortunately my check-in experience left me very disappointed and pretty much skewed my whole impression of the place towards the negative side.  Mercedes helped us and was pretty unfriendly, unprofessional and incompetent.  My family and I were here for a wedding and had reserved two rooms with two queen beds which I had specified needed to be next to each other.  These reservations were pre-paid and supposed to be guaranteed but it turned out that they \""ran out of double rooms\"" which was a big disappointment and very inconvenient but would've been easier to accept had Mercedes been more apologetic - she proceeded to try and say that I did not in fact reserve a double (said with attitude), so I had to show her my printed out reservation which clearly said \""two double queens\"" and then when she realized she was in the wrong, gave a bit more of the attitude! On top of that, she could not put our rooms nearby- in fact they were 20 rooms apart!!Unbelievable!! Totally inconvenient since I was traveling with two young children and two elderly grandparents.  To make a long story short, the front desk is really where the first impression is made.  When you have incompetent, unprofessional people working there, it just makes the whole establishment look really bad! The service throughout the rest of the resort was hit or miss and always slow: you either got someone really helpful (the bellboy) or a complete idiot (waitress at the pool), there's no consistency or high standard for great service here.  The room itself was nice and spacious, however not ideal when traveling with kids: no locks on bathroom door, mini bar and snack bar that's very easily accessible to kids (you get charged for just picking something up) and no kids' channels on TV.  The casino wasn't very impressive- no one was really hitting anything, there's not a great variety of machines, and good luck trying to get a drink! I could go on and on about all of my disappointments but lets just say that I will not be going back here.  I'm giving two stars for the few individuals that actually were trying to do their job well."
1,"Nearly 500-reviews and a 4.5/5.0 review on YELP for cheap tacos in Vegas? I \""had\"" to try this spot on my last Vegas excursion.\n\n=========\nLOCATION\n=========\n\nIt's located at \""the edge\"" of the heart of the Vegas strip in my opinion. I consider everything from like Excalibur to the end of Wynn the HEART of the strip. Sure you've got the Stratosphere etc. if you go down farther but with Sahara being remodeled, there's a deadspot past the Wynn.\n\nAnyway this place is RIGHT past the Wynn/Encore, on the Strip, headlining a little mini-mall. Seating is limited inside, BRUTAL due to the Vegas summer heat... and there's a ton of seating outside. Unfortunately the inside is pretty small and the lines tend to make things chaotic.\n\nAlso adding to the chaos is there's 2 separate PAY AREAS inside, both on opposite ends of the place. They hand you the food cafeteria style BEFORE you pay, which is cool. What I hated was there's 4 stations and depending on WHAT TYPE of taco you want you have to go to the different stations/lines. One for Abogado (spicy pork), one for Carne Asada and Chorizo. Finally a third one for all other things (tongue, shoulder, brain).\n\n\n=========\nTHE FOOD\n=========\n\n~ CARNE ASADA TACO - The steak was seasoned amazingly. It came with an avocado mash and some other great toppings. (5/5)\n\n~ ADOBADA (spicy pork) TACO - This was interesting. The meat looked delicious, nice seductive red glaze to the meat. It was pretty good, not amazing. However the green avocado sauce they put on it bumped it up a bit. I recommend adding that sauce on ALL your tacos. (4/5)\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=oCNAyy80KNhlFskH_cio4A&userid=1pgT-Eeh-GIOlhOgHMMRZA\n\n\n~ MULAS - I \""think\"" this was a giant taco with an additional tortilla atop it. (4/5)\n\n~ CHORIZO TACO - It was pretty good as well. Torn between giving it a 3 or a 4. They chop up the tasty looking sausage in front of you... and the grounded meat streams out. (3/5)\n\n~ QUESADILLAS - These aren't your normal \""quesadillas.\"" They are a large taco w/some cheese burned into the tortilla, filled with meat / toppings with a HARD-AS-ROCK CRACKER thing put atop kind've like a hat. It's really terrible. (1/5)\n\n\n=========\nAND SO.....\n=========\n\nIt was a good spot. \nDefinitely a good place to go if you're balling on a budget. Can't beat $2.00 tacos and $4.00 MEAT quesadillas. I think there was a lot of locals here. I'm curious what the VAMPIRO was. My friend MIGUEL Z. thought these were the best tacos he'd ever had. \n\nAs a tip, ask the person who makes your food for some peppers... they're free and they'll only give em out if you ask. You get a big plate of like 3-4 types of grilled peppers and grilled onions.\n\nI will be back..."
0,"My daughter was moved to this facility after going to the Children's Cancer Center for over 10 years.  Her experience has been so sad, first time two months ago for her first IVIG treatment there:  We always have someone go with her, we were told no seats for any visitors and we were to wait for 5 hours in the lobby.  Then she has always had her IV in her arm and they argued with her about this and told her it had to be done in her hand!  Down fall number 2!  I feel that since we have the insurance and pay the bill we have patient rights and my daughter was refused to have her treatment administered as she had done it for the past 11 years.  Next they ran her treatments too fast and may have even used another form of IVIG!  She has been sick after both treatments and this last one she had to go to the ER the following Monday after her treatment.  We are lost!  We wonder if they listen to their patients or just farm them in and out?? This is how my daughter feels and my feelings are the same.  Patients have rights and Comprehensive Cancer needs to listen to the patient, the patient knows their body better than anyone.  Since my daughter may be heading for a relapse."
0,"A friend swears by this place... so we gave it a go.\nInsert \""Family Feud\"" Buzzer here.  \n\nSeated fairly quickly, friendly, helpful service and clean tables.  Eggs good, thick cut bacon good and now for pancakes:\n\nLEMON BLUEBERRY PANCAKES - thick, dry frisbees only made better by dunking in syrup\nFLORENTINE EGGS BENEDICT - same o, nothing special except more butter on the english muffins\n\nMonkey may return to try the CORN BEEF HASH made from real brisket..."
0,"The service was fairly friendly, but the coffee was terrible. It cost me $3.25 for a small coffee with sugar free vanilla syrup. I threw it away, as no amount of cream and sugar could make it drinkable."
0,"I probably would have dined here once a week, but the cook would not serve me vinegar with my pizza because it was not how she was serving it.  Really? What if it is how I wanted to eat it. I eat out 5 nights per week, not one chef ever refused to do anything they could to please."
0,"If you love cold \""glue\"" soup and terrible service...this is the place for you! Went there today for a quick lunch with my sister on my quest to try all things pumpkin and was really let down.\n\nNegatives\n1) Our waitress forgot we were there and then forgot our drinks, then after getting our drinks, never refilled them again.\n2) Soup was delivered cold. Yum, my favorite....Not! (Yeah, I went all 90's on it)\n3)Not a cheap place to eat - 2 bowls of soup and 1 piece of pie and I'm out $30!\n\nPositives\n1) The cornbread and honey butter was good\n2) The pumpkin pie was tasty and will probably make my pumpkin list, however next time I will just go buy a whole pie and take it home.\n\nSorry guys, its a no - go!"
0,"so wednesday was our anniversary. 31 years! i never thought i'd ever live to see that!!! like when you're 10 & you think 30 is soooo far away! we decided to try a new restaurant instead of 1 we've been to before. we agreed on brasserie 33. we love french food! not since lepommier have we had good french food. i called the place on monday to make reservations. a polite, french-accented man answered. i asked if they had booths. he said no, but he would give us their best table, table 15. he said it was in a quiet corner by itself. i thanked him for that & said it was for our anniversary, so that would be wonderful.\nwe found the place, in a strip mall. there was a laundromat  a few doors down! we thought this place was supposed to be nice. parking was terrible as 1 would expect on ellsworth. as we walked up to the place, we saw through the window that table 15 was already filled. uh-oh! it was fairly empty-3 tables & 6 at the bar. i tried to say we had resevations when the waitress came up. yes, yes, yes she said & then asked us something about the menus. unfortunately, i didn't understand her through her french accent. i said give us both menus. tom realized she had said regular or groupon menu, & we got the regular menu. she sat us at a table right at the end of the bar & kitchen, not at all private. \nwe placed our order, & waited for long periods of time for each course. i know, made to order takes a while, & there was just the 1 cook, but we did wait, a lot, & they weren't that busy! tom got the escargot, salade lyonnaise & the bouillabaisse. i ordered the vol-au-vent with shrimp & scallops, salade d' endive et de betteraves & the roti de canard au cassis. we also got a bottle of wine from the very limited selection. we finished with the profiteroles for dessert. the food was good. but, it wasn't outstanding, just good. my duck was actually overcooked, burnt on the bottom. every plate was covered to the rim with parsley. the waitress seemed hurried, not to be bothered. her response was always-monsieur/madam, yes, yes, merci, merci, & then she was gone. for what we paid, with tip, about $200, we were sorely disappointed. for $200, there are ALOT of other restaurants we could've gone to & been extremely happy with our evening.\ntom went to the bathroom & said it wasn't very clean. as well, he said doors were open to the dishwashing room & somewhere else. he said the sights in those rooms were not something you'd want to see.\nat 1 point, 5 older men who were at the bar drinking, sat down at the table next to us. really??? 7-8 other tables & they sit next to us???? they had been drinking quite a bit at the bar. when they sat down, each of them had their own bottle of wine to have with their meal, as if they needed more alcohol! they were loud, they were obnoxious, they were rude. they said they were dentists. 1 more reason why i fear doctors! they made racial comments. they made sexual comments. the waitress didn't help. she would come over & basically let these guys paw her up. 1 guy grabbed her leg as she went by. another said he wanted he wanted her breasts, not the check. she went along with all of it. in fact, suddenly, her thick french accent was gone!\nwe won't be back there again!"
1,"I've had Sammy's a few times, usually \""to go\"". Today I decided to have a sit down and eat. We came in just in time for Happy Hour! What are the odds of that! 3-6pm daily, half off all tapas and $2 off alcoholic beverages. If I didn't forget my ID I would of taken advantage of the drinks. The tapas menu is pretty intriguing as well. \n\nI decided on the Lobster Mac & Cheese, which was about $5. It was the perfect amount. Considering it is a pasta so it's pretty heavy I decided not to get another item for myself. It had a good amount of Lobster in it. It wasn't TOO cheesy. And the dish wasn't as small as I thought it would be. \n\nThe beau got the garlic chicken pizza. Besides the fact that it came with mushrooms and I accidentally ate one, it was pretty delicious. I loath mushrooms! It definitely had a woodfire taste to it. It was thin crust which I loved. \n\nService was alright. She came and got our orders quickly but we didn't see our waitress the rest of the time. And our check took forever to arrive. Other than that I love Sammy's!"
1,"Honestly, we didn't expect much from The Orleans hotel. An affordable hotel usually means you get what you pay for. Here, everything was different. The Orleans surely is not comparable to most 21st Century lifestyle places in Vegas, but it kept the charme of \""the old Vegas\"" without appearing too antique or shabby. Old school style room with nice beds, clean and great view, no matter where you're located, as the hotel stands free. Bathroom with window, so you can get some fresh air without the ac hammering all time. Staff and amenities were great. The 70 lane bowling centre a must! Past midnight recommended. We also enjoyed the pool are that doesn't suffer from all day hammering mainstream music (well, there's music of course, but in an acceptable way), relaxed people and enough space to even swim! Negative, if you like Wi-Fi on your room, you have to pay. Also, but that's what we don't like with most Vegas hotels, a complete useless resort fee. But that's all. Great stay anyway!"
1,"I have not experienced the issues of the previous reviewers.  I frequent this Starbucks almost every workday.  I find the employees to be friendly, welcoming, and oure grace under fire.  I have waited in long lines, but it seems they move it along pretty quickly. \n\nThe only negative experience I have had is when I have to wait for the \""high maintenance\"" customer that is in line in front of me with a list of special order drinks, paying separately for each one because they are not smart enough to do basic math.  I secretly wish they trip while carrying their drinks on the way back to their self important job."
0,"Stayed in the hotel for a conference and did not feel like going out to eat. Ordered the caprese salad. Pretty safe bet, right? 5 tiny cubes of mozzarella with 3 cherry tomatoes.  I also ordered the buffalo wings. It was hard to describe the texture but imagine if the chicken had been soaking in water all day and then put in the fryer for 30 seconds. It was weird and mushy and made me question the safety of eating it. The ranch dressing that came with it was also so watery that it dripped off of the carrot stick so that only a thin whitish film remained.  \n\nI ordered a side of arugula because I like to eat it with my caprese salad. This was good thinking because it ended up being the only (sort of) substantial thing I ate that night.\n\nService was great, though. \n\nLess than a 10 minute walk away is Switch Restaurant, an IHOP and a bunch of other places. Eat there instead."
1,"One of the alloy wheels on my 2008 BMW was badly gouged by a \""cowboy\"" tire shop, and looked beyond cosmetic repair.  I happened upon this business through a review in Car and Driver magazine.  They work mainly with car dealers but also offer their services to the public.  The people could not have been more charming and the service was incredible.  The damage was too severe for their mobile service, so they took my wheel into their shop overnight and delivered it the next morning.  It is like a new wheel!  All for $125.  Highly recommended!"
0,Holy $25-OJ (x2) - 1 side of bacon - English muffins (x2) - drunken breakfast batman!
0,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. I calked to get an appointment. Explained I didn't want a full groom as my dog is 15+ years old and can't tolerate standing that long and gets stressed, but still want her coat shaved for comfort. So I bring her in and wait for her - none of the three hour appt. stuff. Get there and they tell me come back in two hours to get her, I explain that's not what I scheduled for, dog too old, just want shaved, they look for the girl who took the appt and she stood there and to my face I never said it was a \""straight through\"". I said I told you the dog was too obs, just wanted groomed, couldn't tolerate a long appointment and she says you didn't say straight through, very argumentative. The groomer says she will do it, will have to call other client to say it will be longer, guilt factor towards me.\nThen I hear someone in the back scolding a dog saying stop it over and over in a mean voice so now I definitely wasn't leaving.\nThey bring my dog out 35 minutes later looking a mess, saying can you pet her, she's getting too stressed, I said, it's fine we just want to go. My dog is patchy, horrible but I just wanted her out if their hands.\nPlace stinks like cheap pine sol, staff seem to not be too customer focused.\nThen they ask four different people what they should charge since she didn't get a bath, blow, brush, just a straight shave. No one knows so they charge me full price $65. I said \""do you really think that's a fair price? And the cashier says the groomers are contractors so they can charge whatever they want.\nWill never go back and will tell everyone I know to stay away! They are ridiculous and I expect them to be closed in 6 months."
1,"There are a lot of wood fired pizza places that I have been to but this one sticks out to me. It's quick and you can customize it with anything you desire & its so delicious. The only thing is that the people working there aren't all that friendly. They always look pissed off. But the good food makes up for it I guess. If I saw a smile once in a while, it would be 5 stars easily:)"
1,"Love this place! Really nice staff, competent servers, delicious food. (And very reasonably priced! Bonus.) My kiddos love anything that involves beans and rice and this restaurant is within walking distance from our house. Perfect. Endless chips and salsa for the kids and a margarita for mama. Does it get any better than this?\n\nMy husband and I have also ordered take out and were pleased with that as well. The other night I really just wanted to order chips and salsa to munch on while watching March Madness, I had no need for a huge meal - much to my surprise I could order an individual taco for $4. I ordered the crispy shrimp taco in a crispy corn taco shell, my husband ordered a veggie quesadilla (Friday during Lent for all you Catholics out there...no meat!) and our grand total came to $14. This $14 included a HUGE bag of crispy chips and two kinds of salsa. I felt a little guilty paying less than $15 for dinner! But I got over it.\n\nThumbs up! It always looks busy so I guess people keep coming back. If you haven't given it a try, I recommend you check it out."
1,"What a buffet!  The food was soooooo delicious and the desserts....THE DESSERTS!!!  I won't need to elaborate on the food except...you should try it!  But, I did take away 1 star because of the following:\n\n1. Of course the \""best buffet in L.V.\"" has about a 2 hour wait on Sunday evening at 6:30pm...still it was worth it.\n\n2. We came in a group of 6 + 1 baby.  When we got to the cashiers, we told her that we had that many in our party and she told us that they only have seats for groups of 5 or less.  What?!  I don't believe it!  So we said we'd split if that was the only case.  When we got to the end of the line for seating, we saw TWO groups of more than 7 people (who were in line WAY behind us) go in together!  When I asked the host why we were told they didn't have tables for 6 or more, she told me we asked to split up!  And that if we really wanted to, we could've pretty much begged the cashier to put us together, but our wait would be much longer.  WHAT?!  The family BEHIND us didn't have a \""much longer\"" wait than us.  \n\nUsually, with service like that, I'd take at least 2 or 3 stars off...but it was good food, AND the waiters who walk around were SO nice!!!!  Yes, each person is about $51 during weekend dinner time, but this is a top buffet...I think it's actually CHEAP for what you'll get!"
1,"After pre-gaming at other nightclubs/lounges, my group and I finally made it to Surrender and just in time (5 mins before the open vodka and champagne bar ended!).  I was able to get in 2 drinks  :D \n\n I've never been to Surrender, so I wasn't really sure which way to go in the hotel... as we were aimlessly walking, we saw the line and was trying to find the end, but one of the promoters pulled us to the front - JUST LIKE THAT!  It was pretty awesome since we were on a time limit & b/c we were just walking through.  I, of course told him who's list we were on (gotta give credit to him).  It was FREEZING that night, so they had a tent up that night since Surrender is mainly an outdoor nightclub.  \n\nThe women's restroom inside the dragon room only has 3 stalls, but the line wasn't even that bad, so no problems there!  The bartenders are attentive and quick to serve.  I enjoyed half one of the two DJs that were playing that night.  It was interesting b/c there was a DJ at both ends of the room and they would switch back and fourth.  \n\nSome guys were handing out glow stick tubes that said \""Surrender\"" on it and I managed to get one (which made my night even MORE fun - as lame as that sounds).  \n\nI didn't really look at the crowd too much - I was having too much fun in my own little world I guess.  I didn't have people bumping into me on the dance floor and no one was spilling their drinks on me, so I was a happy camper.  A couple friends and I were able to dance on the stage, which also made it a fun night!  I can't wait to go back when its HOT so I can enjoy the outdoor areas."
0,"At first look this seems like a great fun place. And it might be if you just dine there. HOWEVER if you decide to partner up with them for any type of events just know that you will be entirely on your own for promotions etc....\n\nThe food was okay but the service was slow. After our event which by the way no management came out to say is everything okay or is there anything you need....we decided to order. Had to flag down the waiter. They brought over one menu for a table of five, then had to ask for water. After ordering it took approx 25 minutes for our food to arrive. Then it was brought out without utensils or napkins. Might as well have been a self serve. Plus one of the items that we ordered never arrived! Had to also go inside and request check. I had a friend who sat inside and they said the service was not much better.\n\nWill I ever be back...no!\n\nThe only plus for this business is that you can bring your dog!"
0,"Very overpriced for starters, but that would be fine if the food was worth it. Many of the patrons were drunk and loud, so have a feeling this is a place for rich lawyers to call home and throw their money at. That's fine, just not looking to throw $35 for a mediocre steak and have to deal with profane-laced loud conversations and hooting and hollering that belongs in a sports bar. Totally overrated."
0,"the service and food is alot better at your local Hometown Buffet then the Sahara buffet.\n\nbesides the food, the funniest thing about this buffet is the sign at the front of the line limiting your buffet \""experience\"" to only 2 hours.\n\nif you can survive 2 hours at this place, you deserve a prize."
0,The employees are awesome!  The only problem was the bed and the awful sheets!  The mattress should have been replaced and the sheets felt like burlap sacks!  Be aware of the Numb Bar....the value of the tasty frozen drinks are a rip off....50 plus bucks for two big plastic drink glasses filled with a supposed 3 shots is not accurately poured!  Oh well...when your in Vegas!
1,A great place to eat. Fresh food and good people behind the bar.
0,"I've been here a few times and we went for dinner tonight and the food was ok, but the service was beyond bad for a medium-end steakhouse.  The waiter took 10 minutes to even come over, didn't explain the menu or that the dinner includes a salad and we asked for caesar and uncharged us $9 without even explaining it.  The food took forever and the waiter barely checked on us.  After I asked for a check he went to check on 3 other tables and took 10 minutes to get our bill.  I wouldn't go back!!!"
1,This is one of the better boba places around Chinatown. I usually get a watermelon smoothie and it is definitely fresh watermelon. The dried prunes and such are great. The spicy dried guava is my favorite. The service and boba is usually pretty consistent for me. No complaints.
0,"a friend and i ate there yesterday. we love asian buffets and are always looking for good ones that we can look forward to going to over and over again. this wasn't it.  overall the place was clean. yes, the carpet was worn and stained, but that's why you don't use carpet in restaurants. it wasn't anything that would turn us away though. the tables were clean, clean bathrooms, etc. the selection of food was average to above average. the taste of the food varied but was not bad. there were  things that i liked the taste of, were it not for the temperature. i never expect \""steaming hot\"" when i get food from a buffet, but it better be warmer than room temperature, which is what most of the food was. even worse, some of the beef and chicken items were cold, and i mean spit-it-back on-the-plate cold. i started having serious doubts about the safety of eating there. add to that the service. there was one male and one female employee, both just wearing jeans and t-shirts, nothing that matched or looked like any kind of restaurant uniform at all. they just grabbed random clothes from home and went to work. this isn't a big deal, but there was nothing that set them apart from customers, nothing to let you know that they were employees, and it just added to their overall unprofessional manner. actually, the male wasn't bad, he removed our plates fairly quickly and seemed somewhat pleasant. but the female just looked annoyed at having to work. no smile or greeting when she seated us, no smile the one time she came to our table to refill our drinks, took forever to bring our check, then no smile or even a \""thank you.\"" we couldn't wait to leave, and both agreed we'd never go back."
0,"I found this place via Groupon and went with a friend for lunch. The building it is located in in very charming and the patio would be great once the weather cools down a bit. Some of the decor inside the restaurant seems a little outdated but overall I found it very charming and cute - in a downtown Glendale kinda way :) The owner greeted us as we walked in and seated us at a small table right by the front door. As instructed by Groupon we informed him that we had a voucher. I asked him how long the restaurant had been open since this was the first time I had been here and he told me that the restaurant had been open for 5 years and that they were very busy and successful. I didn't want to read into his demeanor, but he came across somewhat arrogant. We decided that we wanted to try several of the dishes and ordered the Greek salad, the cheese and ham plate with toasted bread and the prosciutto bruchetta. The food was good and very tasty but the owner and staff are something else. When we placed the order the owner said something like \""well you Groupon people order so much because you have a voucher\"". I was thinking to myself that if he doesn't want \""groupon people\"" then maybe he shouldn't put out a Groupon. Total turnoff. I enjoy trying new places and Groupon is a great way to find them, therefore I will not be made to feel guilty for using one. I would have been back for another try for dinner, but the owner totally turned me off to going back."
1,Great coffee! Love that my kids can get gelato or frozen yogurt and I can get coffee at the same place. They have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and the staff is very friendly and helpful.
0,"Oh, man, this place is just the worst!  \n\nHere's a rundown of why it sucks so very much:\n\n1.  You will wait at least 3 hours for your appointment time.  Scheduled for 1:00 p.m.?  Yeah, good luck with that.  You won't see anyone until 4;\n\n2.  You want to make an appointment?  Good luck with that, too.  They apparently do not have call waiting. So, you'll just have to keep calling, like you're trying to win a radio contest in 1997.  Except, here, you will win only pain.\n\n3.  The staff are not friendly.  They openly refer to the waiting rooms as \""holding cells.\""  Screw youuuuuuuu; and\n\n4.  The waiting room smells like urine.  Like, really strongly.\n\nThe only redeeming quality is that you'll get to watch a ton of trashy daytime t.v.  Maury forever."
1,"Just adding to the long list of great reviews! I've never been to a place that had so many beers on tap. It was awesome. Plus, it's not that pricey either."
1,"My kind of mall. This mall has everything you can possibly need while on vacation or otherwise. The mall really serves a wide range of clientele from your Macy's to Saks and Niemen Marcus. They have your jewelry stores, specialty clothing stores and ABC convenience store (which while in Vegas I always hit up for their 99 cent Nestle waters). \n\nThe food court is large with a glass window overlooking the strip towards the Wynn. A good variety of food offerings from Wendy's, steak sandwiches, Hot Dog on a Stick, Greek, Asian, Mexican, it's all there.\nLocated downstairs and facing the strip are several restaurants like Maggianos and El Segundo.\n\nIt's a one stop shop."
1,"Cibo is a great place to bring someone who doesn't know about it already you'll score some cool points for being in the know. I love the concept of a restaurant set in a historic house that in itself is cool in its own right  and the food is tasty but the service is horrible! The waiter comes to your table takes down your order and is never to be seen again till your done with your food. Grrrrr! Despite the bad service I still come back for more because i'm obsessed with the bruschetta here.  The appetizer comes with three different types of bruschetta tomato, cheese with prosciutto, and some weird bean stuff  weird but tasty. The pizza is pretty good too but I think the sauce tastes a little like ragu...really :)"
0,"Excellent customer service is imperative, this location does not have that. Visited this location on 4/29/14 around 10:45PM and the girl that took our order was rude. I'm chalking down that she hates her job and probably her life. Granted, she did say \""thank you\"" once, so she has some hope of success in customer service. It's nice this location is open 24hr and 70% of the time they get your order right. I'll drive to another location for my hungover needs."
1,"Delicious, but expensive.\n\nDined here a few weeks ago and I just remembered right now how awesome the dinner rolls were. They looked sweet from the glaze on top, but there was salt sprinkled on top.\n\nCame here during Pacquiao-Cotto fight weekend so excitement was in the air at MGM. The restaurant was packed and everybody looked like they were having a good time.\n\nWith our party of 6, most of us ordered the surf and turf deal with respective sides. My gf and I got that along with the carrots and risotto.   Take note that the sides are HUGE and definitely family style. The filet mignon and shrimp was satisfying.\n\nAfter feasting, we ended the night with chocolate souffle and ridiculous sized serving of coffee. Each person got their own french press!\n\n6 people = $750. If you're looking for a lower priced steakhouse with a celebrity chef, I'd highly recommend StripSteak by Michael Mina at Mandalay."
1,"Stopped by for dinner before seeing Penn & Teller at the Rio last week. It was my first visit to this location, so I was surprised to see such a small one in a food court. Great sandwiches as usual, though. Can't go wrong with their Ham & Swiss."
0,"Nice place, but everyone there was extraordinarily rude. The patrons and the staff treated us like second class citizens simply because we are in the 20-30 age bracket. Ageist people are horrible to see, let alone interact with.\n\nAside from that, the room was nice. This place is significantly out of the way, so if you were planning on doing anything within Phoenix, stay somewhere else.\n\nEDIT: We discovered a few days after staying here that they charged us for an additional night that we were not there. Upon contacting the company, it sounds like they do this to customers a lot. As a result, I have downgraded my rating."
0,"Penny pinching people. \n\nI have purchased food for a year at Beijing restaurant yesterday I purchased noodles and other items and I had the noodles today it tasted rotten, I called to see about getting a discount because the food was tasting right like its spoilt. I always buy singapore noodles so why does this one taste bad. I asked why it tasted off. The guy that picked up the phone has poor customer service and rude. Refuse to give the names of the owners and refuse to give me a discounted meal or if possible return it. I was prepared to buy another on discount and buy broccolli and  more food and show them the original singapor noodles. I will never purchase anything there. The food is just OK. The only reason I go there because the other chinese restaurants are not near my home."
0,"First and last stay here.....\n\nWow, thats what came to my mind when I walked into our room. I have been going to the Harrah's in Rincon (California for a few years now love the rooms same property but not the same maintenance. It was my frst time ever in vegas now that I'm over the age of 21 I was excited we were in town to see a concert and just have fun. The room looked nice, except for the toilet's non stop running, when we tried to flush it it was stuck. So we called front desk they sent over someone and hour later and a part later it was fine but hardly flushed, whatever at least the running stopped. I look out our window and the pool looked like a hurricane tore it apart. Being in vegas you want to drink by the pool. I called the front desk they said \""Oh our pool isn't working right now it's closed till further notice\"", Seriously?\n\nMy friends and I tried to let it go so we went out for drinks, at the Toby Keith Bar (FIVE STARS for sure there) did some gambling (The dealers were amazing and nice) Came back two hours before our show to shower, the lights hardly turned on in the bathroom a bulb was starting to go. We showered, the shower leaked, soaked our clothes that was on the floor. It was a mess, I was very disappointed. I am the type who doesn't care where we stay as long as it's nice, and functioning. Yeah, no never again will I stay here.\n\nAll around I can say the staff was amazing and sweet the hotel needs a lot of work. I understand it's vegas but come on!"
1,"This place is perfect for a date night! Happy hour includes some yummy apps (my fave is the bruschetta) and discounted glasses of wine. There's space to sit at the bar, high top tables, as well as booths. I suggest going on the nights where there is live music to fully enjoy the experience. The servers are friendly and knowledgeable and there is absolutely nothing pretentious about this wine bar. Go try it out!"
1,"I have been to Bond several times over the last couple of years, and it always delivers on flavorful drinks.  Although I had walked by Bond many times, I did not initially give it a shot until I saw a publication that rated it \""the best bar on the strip\"".  I was skeptical because it was usually pretty empty every time I walked by, especially during the day. My skepticism was blown away the first time I walked in and had a drink.  It was one of the most unique and tasty drinks I had ever had.  \n\nSince my first experience at Bond I have been back every time I have visited Vegas.  My most recent experience was probably my best because both the drinks and the service were outstanding.  Our bartender, Cody, is a skilled mixologist that made us some spectacular drinks.  One from the menu, and two of his own special creations.  All of them were excellent. His enthusiasm about his craft made the experience that much better.  He not only made the drinks, but he also provided great details on the ingredients and how they meshed well together.  It was awesome!\n\nBond is not a place I would recommend for a crowded Vegas nightlife experience, but it is about as good a place as you will find to get a well crafted drink. It is always one of my 'must go to' places when I visit Vegas.  I would recommend it to any of my friends seeking a unique and flavorful drink.  I can't wait to go back the next time I am on the strip."
1,"I've been going to Hon Man Tait for at least 10 years now. He was actually recommended to me through a friend of mine who is a mechanic himself (European cars). Anyway, Tait has always stuck by his promises and guarantees. I'd be surprised if he's said a dishonest thing in his life.\n\nTait is well educated and very honest. He gets the job done well for a reasonable price. I will always recommend him."
0,"The complimentary bread and pickled beets were really yummy to start with.  But it would have been nice if we were offered seconds.  For dinner I had the barramundi fish special and my husband had the blue cheese steak.  The fish was nothing special, steak was pretty tasty.  Both meals really needed to have another side - I ordered the market veggies which came with a yummy broth. My DH had a salad.  We sat inside.  It was super crowded so not much of an atmosphere.  Our waiter was GREAT, especially considering how crazy busy it was tonight.  Even with no drinks the bill ended up being nearly $100.  Sorry, not worth it.  Should have gone to Outback for better food and half the price."
0,"Wow-I'm really surprised that this place got as many good ratings as it has.  I had a single cheese burger which was really bad.  The patty was thin, over cooked, and the cheese was not melted.  The fries were fair but I think they were frozen prior.  There were not many people in the place at lunch time as well.  I would be surprised if this place is still around in 6 months."
1,"Great flavor, nice ambiance, and delightful evening."
0,"I have two great dane puppies and was looking to get them their vaccinations and set up to be neutered.\n\nThey offer pet prevention plans which if you sign up for can save you an additional 10-15% additional services.  While for the most basic things this is a rather reasonable expense.  However, one of the pups magically contracted Parvo after being vaccinated for it.\n\nThey wanted to charge me $800 in random tests to find out what was wrong.  I said no and asked them to do 1 test at a time until they found out what was wrong.  Which once Parvo came back positive that saved me nearly 600 dollars.  Seeing as they were the clinic the pups have been seen the most at I continued to use their services to treat Parvo.  A highly contagious and extremely deadly disease.  They used no precautions in handling my dog (gloves, bib, protective gear).  Which scarily may have put other dogs at great risk.  He spent 2 days getting fluids, amoxicillian shots, and anti nausea medicine. I can't speak of him being quarantined or isolated for the safety of other dogs coming in.  All said and done we spent over $1000 dollars in hydrating our dog with 4 anti nausea pills and a bottle of amoxicillian.  Since we were adamant on being consulted before running other various tests that were unnecessary.  After researching and making a few phone calls we asked for an X-Ray to be done at the closing hours. They obliged and ran x-rays after hours for us.  They came back with a blockage and possible intestinal twist scare. They advised us to take our pet to a local emergency pet hospital after spending 2 days in their \""hospital\"". \n\nThe people were friendly but very busy and they were frequently over run with people waiting. Which is part of life, but when our dog has Parvo we should have been informed from the start to keep him isolated and not be walking him through the store. \n\nThe main Dr was very friendly and she did seem knowledgeable but this is a very business oriented place that over charges for some very basic things.   \n\nThe emergency hospital visit is by far more expensive, but we have essentially lost 2 days and $1000 dollars worth of services that could of gone to an establishment better equipped to handle the illness that is very time sensitive and early treatment is critical for our dogs survival. \n\nI highly recommend going to a real vet office."
0,"We took our car in there for the normal service, oil change, tire rotate, bah bah bah...  200 plus bucks, which is expensive, but we like to say that all the cars service has been done at the dealership when we go to sale a car.  We will never bring our car back to these jokers.  When we picked up the car, the steering wheel was starched and gashed.  We took it right back in and they immediately said they didn't do it and that it was normal wear and tear.  Then the manager tried to say make-up from my wife was the issue,  it's my daily driver and I don't wear makeup and last time I checked makeup doesn't gash faces when applied.  They then offered to replace the steer wheel that they supposedly didn't damage at employee pricing with no labor.  Umm if you didn't do the damage why would you offer to do that.  The fact is that they knew they did the damage, but still tried to get into my pocket book for more money. It was very clear the gash was new because of the color and where it was at.  I wouldn't even let these guys service a kids hot wheels car......  VERY BAD SERVICE!"
1,I have been to Nice Nails a few times and I think they are great! In the past I have always just gone to any nail shop that was most convenient at the time. After the few experiences with them I will continue to make them my regular nail shop. My nails always look great!! My eyebrows look good and my nails last! The people who work there remember me and are always nice. I highly recommend Nice Nails!!
0,"Canceling my membership this week.  I rather not exercise at all than go back to this place.  I have been a member for almost a year and every time I am here (about once a week) I am horribly disappointed and often appalled. \n\nWhen you walk in the smell immediately hits you, it smells like sweat and stale body odor.  It is stuffy and way too warm for a gym or a comfortable workout.  If you try to work out anytime between 5pm and 7pm there are always lines for the cardio equipment and often many of the popular weight machines.  The machines are extremely out-dated.  The cardio machines at my old LA Fitness in Ahwatukee have TV's on them the ones at Town and Country are often broken, squeaky or unstable.  Not a good combination for running.\n\nWalk around the back to the \""stretching/resistance\"" area and chances are you won't ever find room to actually use the area.  The locker rooms are just as outdated/dirty/broken.  And make sure you bring your own lock and towel because there is no way they will ever supply you with one should you not bring your own.\n\nAs far as the classes go, I have only taken yoga, not too bad but not at all the level of instruction you would get at a private studio.  This place needs a complete remodel, or a tear down... there is literally not enough room in the building to host all the hundreds of people piling through the doors.  Unfortunately it is the only \""chain-gym\"" in the area which is why I imagine people are still going here."
0,"A great place to pay too much money for mediocre drinks, in an atmosphere thick with douchebags, poseurs and upscale baby-boomers fresh from the nearby Elvis show.  The decor is sort of cool, but so what?  It's not worth the soul-searingly bourgeois, spiritually bankrupt atmo.  There are a million cooler places to get a drink in Vegas."
1,"went there for the first time yesterday, and i can honestly say it exceeded my expectations! i got the spinach linguini with olive & garlic and i added the chicken. best way to describe it is ORAL HEAVEN!!! and to top it all off, the customer service was superb:) i will definitely be back."
1,"Saw that it had finally opened! Not as big as the other location, but I feel as if the sushi is slightly better. The inside is very beautiful with the etched glass dividers and granite-y countertops. A great place to go for a cheap, quick lunch."
0,"I felt taken advantage of. I also didn't like that they just are terrible with up keep. I kept having to ask for stuff that should have been there. They just don't pay attention. Steam room had water coming out from the bottom of the door I almost slipped twice and hurt my ankle.  I moved from California and was a regular at a well known spa there, I guess I have to keep looking. I really wish this would have worked for me. I didn't get my full facial, the lady who gave me the facial must have thought I didn't read what came with my facial. *sigh* so upsetting."
0,"The Tailor I used to go to had to go out of business due to health issues so I have been in search of a new one.  This lady was recommended by one of my friends because she said that she does good work.  I have 3 clothing items that need very small fixings so I decided to take them in to this lady on Miller and Camelback.  \n\nI walk in and the place smells like an older lady that hasn't showered.  Then I walk up to the counter and the lady just stares at me.  I put my items on the counter and asked her how much it would cost to have her re-hem one pant leg of some work pants, she says \""$17.50\"".  I looked at her and said \""for one pant leg?\"" and she says yes.  I then tell her that I think that is pretty expensive considering the tailor I used to go to charged maybe $7.  She leaned back in her chair and said \""you aren't one of my customers\"" in her stupid accent.  So basically she told me if I am not willing to pay $17.50 for her to re-hem one leg of my pants that she doesn't want me as her customer.\n\nHow is this lady staying in business?? First of all the smell of the place would deter me from leaving my clothes in there anyway because I know I would pick them up and they would smell like her which would be a no-no.  Worst business lady ever!!"
0,"I do love the food and the servers are wonderful...during the week day, at lunch, the music was so loud that I could hardly hear my guest...the people at the table next to us commented as well....the lunch crowd is not there for cocktails and partying.  The music consisted of a heavy beat and electric guitar..not condusive to a nice lunch background music....went to Switch for lunch instead of Windsor..since the server at Windsor said he 'tried to tell the manager...but...\"".  Windsor should take a lesson from Switch regarding the background music...love the place and will try again but if the music is as 'heavy and loud', I will make the 'Switch'  and my guests the place for lunch! Please wake up management and turn the music down for the lunch crowd...!!!!"

0,"Late night specials after Midnight!!\n\n$3 burgers!! and $6.99 steak and eggs!!\n\nToo good to be true! Burgers are plain with tomatoes and lettuce.All extra condiments such has cheese, onions, jalepenos, mushrooms etc are each and additional .75 cents.! We were all sober enough to realize that before we started adding more condiments.  Burgers are decent. Hamburger buns are toasted comes with seasoned steak fries which are awesome. A good thing about the burgers are that they do not fall apart in your hand!!\n\nSteaks are plain. Make sure you load up on A1 sauce and hot sauce to get some flavor. Steak is thinly cut and can be overcooked very fast. I would not come here for the steak eggs. 6.99? You can find cheaper deals where you can order 2 steak and eggs plates for 6.99 LOL.\n\nService sucks..at night in general. Felicia took forever to come by to get our order. She did not replenish the table with napkins or silverware. The water lady came by more than Felicia did. the $3 burgers made up for everything!"
0,"Quite literally the worst experience I've ever had taking my car into a shop.\n\nA few weeks ago I found myself desperate for an oil change. This was the first place I called that could get me in the same day and it is fairly close to my office. As I pulled up I had a feeling that I should've just immediately left  - the place looks scary from the outside and the barbed wire fence is extremely uninviting. I went against my gut feeling and I decided to take my appointment as scheduled and boy do I regret it!\n\nAfter giving them the keys to my car and waiting patiently for 45 minutes one of the \""technicians\"" came out to the waiting area and asked for my assistance in the back to take a look at my hood. After changing my oil he must have tried closing the hood while there was something blocking it from shutting. My hood no longer closed properly and was roughly a 1/4\"" off. To fix this cost me $200 at the Infiniti body-shop.\n\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, less than a day after my oil change I noticed my car was leaking oil! I took it in the Infiniti maintenance center for an inspection and they told me that my oil pan has been punctured. Another $200 repair.\n\nIn total their poorly done oil change ended up costing me over $430 for their fee and the repairs.\n\nDo not trust these people with your car!"
1,"Ate here 3 months ago and still craving:\nthe Mac and Cheese (all-the-way smooth creamy and rich)\nthe Fried Game Hen basket (you will never see fried chicken the same again)\n\nFun, chill atmosphere with very friendly and attentive staff.\n\nI can imagine this place is underrated by a full star because it may be a bit pricey. But in my mind it's worth it. If I am still dreaming of food I had 3 months ago, that's 5 stars in my book.\n\nRelated note: this place is similar but better than Gordon Ramsay's Pub at Caesars. Gourmet comfort food vibe."
0,"My experience at this salon could not have been worse! I was the maid of honor for my bestie's wedding and a group of 6 of us went in the morning before the wedding to get pedis and the bride also got a mani. The lady at the front desk was the grumpiest woman on earth, but whatever. We got our pedis, and it was mostly enjoyable. The technicians were not all excellent, but for the most part we were happy with the results. The environment was comfortable and clean, and it was a relaxing morning.\n\nThe problem was that just 5 hours later, the bride's nails were already chipping. She wasn't washing dishes or doing anything crazy, but she was running some errands and doing the normal last minute stuff before a wedding. Unfortunately, even though we had made a big deal about this being the bride, the nail techs did not recommend something longer lasting like acrylic nails or even gels for the bride, so we hadn't thought much about the mani she got until it started chipping. Ok, fine. We decide to go in the morning of the wedding and have them touch up her mani, assuming they will do that for us for no charge because it was their work that hadn't held up. \n\nFalse. They charged her for a whole new manicure! So here's my friend, totally in tears the morning of her wedding, and these people are telling her she should have got a gel manicure instead (she never gets manicures so she didn't even know what that was) and telling her it was her fault that her nails chipped within 5 hours of having them done. It was so ridiculous! Needless to say, I'll never go back to this place and recommend you skip it too. Awful customer service. Awful attitudes."

I would've spilled 10 minutes into it.\n\nThe guy who did my massage did not introduce himself so I don't remember his name, but my bf said his masseuse, female, also used very firm pressure. I can't even describe my massage as \""firm\"" pressure. It was like, I was a piece of steak being tenderized by a mallet. I'm not even exaggerating. On top of that, when he used his elbows on my back, it wasn't just on muscle, it was also on bone. It has been 2 days and I still have tender spots on my vertebrae. I've been to other foot spas where I was so relaxed I fell asleep. I think I got even more sore here from being tense from my 60 minutes of torture. NEVER AGAIN."
0,"This place has HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Especially the hostess/cashier in the front, the lady has serious attitude problem: if your staff cannot deal with human being in the front, please schedule that person to work BOH, so she/he can provide the best use of his/her labor. We had problem with this lady on 2 different occasions already. Once was on Christmas eve /day, I called ahead of time to see if they were open, and was told they are open till 9PM. So I went there around 5ish, and was told by the lady that they STOP seating already, I understand that you were busy, but the tone and attitude she had was really bad, and rude.\nSecond time was last night, we got there early, again 5ish, SAME person: \""sorry we stop seating for today unless you have a reservation\"", I replied \""I thought you guys dont' take reservations?!\"", she answered \""yes, we don't, but it's our 3rd anniversary, so we open for reservations.\"", I asked her how would the customer know if they can or cannot book reservation, she replied with a VERY rude and unprofessional tone, \""well, if you have been to our restaurant for the last few weeks, we have been talking about it.\"".\nREALLY?? so you are telling me that if I don't go every week, Im NOT welcome here?!? I work in service industry, I know how important it is to be nice to your customer, even the assholes, I always answer with a smile on the face when Im in front of customers, I also co-own a restaurant, and I know damn right it's NOT the right way to treat the customers. She better be the owner there, otherwise the owner should really consider to get rid of her, she obviously can not be working as the front of the house. There are plenty of sushi houses in town, food there is not bad, but for the last few times I went there, the service had been lacking and some of the service staffs have the attitude of \""oh-our-place-is-so-good-and-you-are-SOOOO-lucky-to-eat-here, now-what-the-heck-do-you-want-me-to-bring-you?\""\nI will not be the one that's paying money to take shit from service staffs.

Great taste.\n- No old film over curries \n- Hint of spice! \n- To-Go buffet same price as lunch. $12.\n- They had some chopped fruit, but didn't look too appetizing. \n- 2.5 plates, naan, and vermicelli pudding was enough to put me in a food coma..zZzZ\n- I'd chose Mint if you come solo and want to yolo. But if you're +1, this is the place since you can use the $15 for 20 value and get the mango dessert from check-in!"
0,"I took my parents to Bavarian Point on word of mouth. I should have used YELP!   I am sad to report that this was the worst experience I've ever had. From the moment we walked in - there was a lack of attention. I honestly thought it was a seat yourself type of place, because there was NO ONE, NO ONE in the front to great you. Now, I've never been to a German restaurant and it can be a bit overwhelming. I don't know what the hell to order! It made it worse that the menu was in German, I get that I am in a German place, but last I knew - we aren't taught German in school and when the person came around to take our order, I swear it was at least 30 min. Terrible!  While we were waiting for our mystery food my mom found a baby roach on the table! She trapped it under her water glass that was empty, due to lack of service - but THAT WAS IT!  We walked out - we had to... \n\nAll I can say is Good Luck to you if you eat there! May there not be any roaches in your food or table!\n\nPROST!"
1,"Our kids love a visit to Diner 7 and it's easy to see why. Relaxed atmosphere - very family friendly - and delicious burgers make for a fun time for the children and their accompanying grown ups. The menu isn't vast, but has everything you'd expect from a fast food burger joint that's probably the nearest we'll get to a real American diner."
1,"We decided to try here after we couldn't get into several places because of the holiday.  It was still only 5PM and it was getting busy when we got there.  We had a few minutes to wait.   Just after being seated, the restaurant started to fill to capacity.  As busy as they were, there were employees doing nothing but serving chips and salsa, refilling drinks.  YES, they do give refills on drinks contrary to what another reviewer said.  They were constantly bringing more chips and salsa if you wanted it.  free   Service was wonderful, very attentive.  Servings were huge, hot, and fresh.  Tables were being cleaned as soon as guests left with clean towels each time, not the rags used over and over like most places do.  Chairs were being wiped down, also.  The manager was very visible in the dining room, helping servers and checking guests.  There was a mariachi band tonight going from table to table.\nThe tables and chairs and custom made and so pretty.  The decor is very nice.  The only complaint I have is how cold it was. \nI had the whole deep fried talapia.  delicious.  My husband had the huge bacon wrapped shrimp.  Four of us and none of us were able to finish.   We can't wait to go back to try something else!"
0,For the price I was incredibly disappointed. My steak (medium rare) was totally over cooked. Our waitress forgot to place one of our side dishes so it came out when we were nearly done. Our waitress didn't offer any type of modifications for one of our gluten free diners and completely forgot the extra plates we asked for. \n\nThe only shining items from our meal were the mashed potatoes and wine.
0,"First, let me say that the customer service at the Sedona location is very good. The technician more than competent. She gets five stars.\n\nMy problem is with billing and the website. As we made payments, we never got a statement reflecting the payments even though my husband asked for corrected invoices. Also wrote two letters... No response. The invoice/Ascension were only on the site once and then disappeared. The results never showed up when we logged on. \n\nNow we are told it's going to collection and we'll have to make payment arrangements with the agency. But they don't know who the agency is or what their procedures are. Interesting because we've called three times and each time been told it's going to collection \""tomorrow\""."
1,Yes this place is growing on me.  I guess they had a rough couple days but now the place seems to be a bit faster.  I've had to go several more times because my Keurig is still on the fritz.\n\nThe people working there are always very nice and friendly.  My only gripe is that I only sometimes get a chocolate covered espresso bean atop my coffee lid.  It is a nice treat but I can't determine how they decide when you get one and when you don't . . . .
0,Never again...I guess they don't have much in the way of Mongolian bbq in Madison but this was a poor excuse for it at best...the meat didn't look fresh...the bar area was not well maintained...food was everywhere...the sauce area was a disaster...the offer you rice and soup to go with your dinner and the rice isn't cooked properly...and the soup was a sad excuse for hot and sour...YUCK!!!\nOnce and only once...never again HuHot
1,"My flatmate told me about this place and it's so close to me I'm surprised I've never noticed it before. Myself and three friends decided to check it out and for a Sunday it was easy enough to get a table, and the service was very quick. There was a lot of choice on the menu of really good sounding food and I went for the french toast with bacon and maple syrup on sourdough bread. It was gooooood. Everyone enjoyed their food and we were all impressed with the cafe in general. It was nicely decorated and cosy. My only complaint was that they didn't leave the jug of maple syrup with us, but maybe that was a good thing! :D"
0,If only I could give it no stars!\n\nI have a small group of friends and we get together once a year. We've been staying at this hotel for the last eight years. It's never been an awesome place but for the cost and location we felt that we got good value out of the joint.\n\nNOT anymore! I have no idea what the new owners is thinking but I think he/she is cutting corners and the cheapness is making for a truly unpleasant stay.\n\nThe rooms have cleanliness issues. \nThe hot tub is never hot.\nThey have a 'free' breakfast but it's beyond barebones and not remotely good. How do you make waffles sour!? \nThe new owners have removed things like tissue boxes to save on costs. The toilet paper has a very sand like feeling. \nBring your own soap and shampoo because IF you are lucky enough to get some in the room it's beyond crappy.\nOur toilet flooded and the first floor flooded on another day.\nThey do not cool the halls. If you are on any floor but the first in the main building you are walking into a sauna.\nThe staff at the desk is for the most part very slow (Skip is the exception). \nAnd on an on. \n\nFor the kind of services you get now this hotel is very overpriced. You can find better for less. Save your money.
1,Nice to meet the friendly new owners\nGood lentil soup and good coffee\nwe will be back\nAlways want to support a small business owner\nShe is supportive of writers visiting to write\nyahoo\nI will send my women writers friends in Scottsdale Society of Women Writers
1,"It was 2 in the afternoon and neither of us had anything to eat yet..  So we were beyond famished...we were becoming irritable.  We decided to quickly scan the Grand Canal for a place to eat...we didn't want a super fancy restaurant at the hotel to have lunch.  We passed the food court...and thought nah!  Saw Canonita and said, let's try Mexican in Vegas.  \n\nThe decor at Taqueria Canonita is characterized by high-ceilings, bright bold colors, Mexican tiles and Mexican art. Taqueria Canonita offers outside patio dining beside the Grand Canal which offers views of the Venetian streetscape and passing gondolas.\n\nWe started with guacomole and chips.  The guac was fantastic...I could have just eaten that with a spoon.  Great texture, very chunky and flavorful.  My entree was thePescado Vera Cruz - fresh catch of the day (happened to be Mahi Mahi that day) sauteed w/ sweet chiles, red onions, green olives, and lemon all simmered with a hearty marisco broth and white rice.  It was yummy.  I'd get that again if I wanted to eat on the light said.  \n\nHe ordered the Colima Pollo con Limon - grilled chicken breast marinated w/ lime and roasted garlic topped w/ chayote and red cabbage salad, seasonal grilled vegetable and borracho beans.  I wish I had ordered that instead.  Not only did it look yummy, it was great!  The chicken was tender and juicy.\n\nTotal bill with tip:  $58"
1,"These donuts were fantastic. We were in the area on vacation and as is customary, I had to find a local donut shop. I could not have been more excited to stumble across this gem! My husband picked out an old-fashioned, chocolate-glazed donut. I grabbed a chocolate covered sprinkle raised donut as well as a chocolate-covered cake donut and I was blown away. Amazing crisp outside with soft inside, not too doughy and perfect frosting ratio. We were incredibly impressed, and the prices were great too!"
0,"We have visited Bally's many times over the last 40 years.  It is definitely time to tear this one down and start over.  Other than a perfect location there is nothing to recommend it.  Rooms are old and run down, breakfast buffet for 11.95 did not include coffee of juice and consisted of one very short line of nothing really special.  So $32.00 later I would recommend just getting a bagel.  The on line check out did not work so I could not view my bill without standing in line again with all the people who were checking in when I am checking out.  I am having to call and fight to get one because my charges don't look right at all.  They charge $3.00 per day for use of the in-room safe of you can believe it.  Was told the daily resort fee included the Internet connection but the instructions were so bad I had to go to the front desk for an explanation.  By that time I didn't really need it I just waited until I got outside to use my phone.  The resort fee is a joke because the Spa is so far away from the South Tower who on earth would want to wander through the Casino to get there.  I know everyone charges one so why don't they just include it as part of the cost of the room I ask?  The dealers were mostly friendly but blackjack games were somewhat limited and the show was good but there are much, much better hotels there for not so much more money.  My husband and I really stayed for the tennis courts but next time we will stay at Caesars and walk across the street.  Unless you are just young kids out to drink with your buddies and don't care I recommend you pass on this one."
1,"I was watching the news when I heard Benkovitz closed for good! I was floored, you could have knocked me over with a feather. This place was pure pittsburgh, a landmark, an iconic restaurant in the Strip. \n\nAs a kid, we'd all get in my cousin's car on a friday night during Lent and go to Benkovits and order fish sandwiches and bring them back home to our waiting family. Sometimes we'd order as many as 17 sandwiches with fries and onion rings and walk back into the house with 7 bags of food. Of course the kids would sit on the living room floor and the adults would eat at the table. Oh those memories! \n\nThose fish sandwiches were huge, each sandwich housing two huge pieces of battered cod and those hand cut fries. Made Lent worth giving up meat.\n\nBenkovitz was a Strip icon since the sixties, but in business for over 100 years. When PNC Park opened in 2001 a Benkovits was there, selling those fish sandwiches in their own little corner of the stadium.\n\nI'll miss them, they were a part of Pittsburgh and I and the rest of Pittsburgh will miss them! Thank you for 100 great years!"
1,My 9 year old is a spaghetti and meatball  connoisseur and this was his all time favorite go to place. We are so very sad to see you close :(
1,"Great non typical fast food.  Had the Nice to Greek You order and it was very good although not exactly filling.  The side salad I thought was too small.  The choice of ice teas was also good.  Communal big table was OK, not thrilled with it.   Staff was friendly.  Overall  a great experience will be back for at least a second time."
0,"mediocre food to say the least, i won't be returning because i got sick after eating here."
0,"Meh. I 've experienced better, as yelp would say. Totally unimpressive. I was very excited to stay here. Rooms were small and it is at the end of the strip. I way prefer the Venetian, way bigger rooms, normally same price, and more in the middle of the strip! Wont stay here again."
0,"This club was a major disappointment, the second time I came here. The first time, I came here, this club was off the chain. They had lapdance beds, and had some nice, young, white woman, walking around that joint. As you can you see, from my first review, of this place, I had a good time. Well, it has changed, since then. I came in at 4pm, and the club was deader than a 85 year hooker, in Alaska. They had one stripper in there, that was about 6'2, that looked like former Boston Celtic, Kevin McChale. The bartender, was smoking HOT, though. When the bartender is the best looking girl in the club, that is not good. She is a sweetheart, as well. The D.J was really cool, too.One change, that I did like, was that this place, serves alcohol ,now. By the look of the strippers, in this place, I can see why.Now to all fairness, of this place, I left at like 7pm. I did see some cute strippers coming in, so Im not going to give up on this place, just yet. I just wish they could hire better looking strippers during the daytime."
1,"One of my favorite restaurants in town , love the food and. Atmospheres there. Bruschetta is the best !!!"
1,"food is very delicious, never had vietnamese food but i now find my self eating here everyday for lunch."
1,"I gave Mom's Good Eats my first try the other day when me and my girlfriend were next door picking up an order at Retro. It's a small hole in the wall joint with no seating but something was calling our name. Good thing we went in and checked it out because it was a good find. Though I must admit we were both very skeptical at first going into a place with no seating and being that we've never eaten there we had no clue what to expect.\n\n We ended up ordering Chicken Tenders smothered in moms Sweet & Spicy Sauce with Sweet potato fries. The lady behind the counter was very friendly and the Kitchen was in plain view so you know your food is made to order. We received our food and proceeded to my car for a \""Picnic\"" lol. As soon as we opened the box my sinuses immediately clear up and I couldn't wait to dig in. Chicken Fingers are one of those foods that are hard to mess up but you can really tell when a place does it well. Crispy enough on the outside with hot & moist white meat on the inside. Mom's special sauce was awesome! not too sweet not too spicy : )\n\nAs for the sweet potato's; they were absolutely to die for! I still have some places to try in town before I can say they're the best I've had but they're up there for sure! They also had some interesting stuff on there menu that I would like to try next time they stop in like Jalapeno Mac & Cheese, Teriyaki Chicken Bowl, Etc. If I didn't live all the way across town this would be the perfect place for when you're on your way home and just want something tasty because you don't feel like cooking kind of nights ; ) I'm giving Mom's Good Eats 4 stars on strength of flavor and reasonable prices. Definitely worth a try!"
1,"Grateful for friends who suggested DLUX for our 13 year olds birthday dinner.\n\nWe look for new places and I was honestly a bit reticent that 'burgers and shakes' might be too mundane to welcome the start of teen years.\n\nYet from the moment we arrived DLUX felt fun and big city, \""ooh, that looks cool\"" - staff was very friendly and welcoming to family in mix of corporate and casual city diners. Bar was packed creating fun feel and tables were well spaced allowing for the odd 5th chair to fit in nicely. Free shake for birthday girl was nice touch as is free parking. \n\nDrinks - good - though fancy sodas are tough to judge and not just for kids (will the ginger strawberry be too spicy, is the grapefruit lime to sour - yes!). A NOTE TO ALL RESTAURANTS - your eaters are better at judging taste profiles than ingredients, help us by giving a sense of taste not assume we know based on ingredients.. One shake (red velvet) was loved by all , the other (lemon chiffon?) too over powering to be consumed even by the table. Still fun to try. \n\nFood - meat burgers loved by all meat eaters, salmon a little too much garlic in sauce, white fish / shrimp odd texture but tasted good. Fries 'perfect' but a little tough. Chimichurri  salad - yummy - needs more seeds, but sharing with table of meat eaters who LOVED the flank steak, really LOVED it - so much flavor. \n\nAgree with others that \""general swank\"" and \""keeping it cahz\"" is trying too hard, no reservations is fine, but so is responding to email requests to check in for big night. \n\nDefinitely worth a try!"
0,"We ate here for Thanksgiving dinner. Perhaps the normal chef was not working but a few of our dishes were disappointing. For their specials they offered a short rib ravioli with black truffle. I expected the ravioli to be chewy and exceptional because, well, It's an Italian restaurant. But I was a bit let down by what I was served. We ordered 2 of the $60 White Alba Truffle Risotto. For that price, it must be well-made right? The risotto was way overcooked, the only good thing about this dish were the truffles. The turkey sausage  dinner was pretty good even though I thought it was going to be bad. For dessert, the Chocolate ravioli berries were delicious. Our server was terrific and made up for the lacking food. I do not think I would eat here again."
0,Please don't waste your time nor money. I did. The manager seems nice but screws you over. I left work for a 2 hour job and it's been over 4 hours now. And this is my second trip due to the techs not doing their job.
1,"Pay no attention to the negative reviews! At the same time, there is some truth to this being a small place with limited parking and a postage stamp sized bar.\n\nThe ravioli is to die for - that's what my lovely lady gets every time. I try to switch it up but I'm in a spaghetti rut. The cool thing is you get to choose from about a half dozen sauces. \n\nNot in the mood for pasta? I tried the pizza and it's not bad but... I wasn't thrilled. However, the meatball sandwich? Yum! Good luck finishing that beast!"
1,"I honestly love Blue Martini - they have some insane Martinis (fly me to the moon anyone?!), their appetizers are insane and if your a chick and a member of their ladies only club you get a coupon for a free martini! Service has always been top notch and they have live music which is a plus!"
0,"They totally ruin the browsing experience of a library by not organizing the non fiction section into general subjects i.e. Cookery.  It's alphabetically done so you have to go the 'V' shelf to go to the vegan cookbooks.  Free WiFi didn't go through on my pc.  Plenty of parking though.  Even though it is a bigger building, it has less books than the Sahara library."
0,"AWFUL experience today...long story short, I am looking for a new dentist. I love our old one, but he's a little far from our house...so, I started by getting recommendations from my area parenting board (the best board EVER). From there I narrowed it down to 3 offices and despite my broken arm, took Truman in his Service Dog vest off to check them out in person. I had a fairly dreadful experience at Dr. Michael Zacher's office. For those of you that don't know, I am a disabled person with a service dog. He is a hypoallergenic poodle and extremely well behaved. I was instructed by Dr. Zacher's Office Manager Rhonda that my dog was not welcome in their office (which by the way is beautiful with tv's, comfy leather sofas and a children's play room). I explained to her that under federal law, a Service Animal cannot be denied access to a facility. And, that I have NEVER in all my time with him (going on 3 years) been asked to leave. I can assure you that I am a very pleasant, nice (even fun) person. Truman was nestled near my feet having a snooze while this happened. He was not in any way disruptive. She told me that she would ask Dr. Zacher. About 15 minutes later Rhonda called back and told me the 'there was not a good fit', and that I could not use Dr. Zacher for my dental needs. I am very upset at being treated in this manner. After all if I had come in with a cane, would I have been denied access? The only recourse I have is to report back to you here and ask you to consider this when making your choices."
1,"Great decor and cute signage for the restrooms. Love the plate glass storefront that looks out on Main Street and City Hall. You can also dine al fresco. The food, I had the MTO breakfast which had 4 different breakfast, toast, 3 eggs and those very good hash browns you're going to hear about. Everything was cooked perfectly. The chicken sausage was my favorite. My dining partner had the salmon burger. Two highlights - homemade pickles on top and they really treat that salmon filet nicely. Highly recommend. For dessert, we had the suggested fried apple slices. Seriously fresh and delish! High points for really happy and competent waitstaff. I recommend this place and I plan on returning."
1,delicious!!
0,"The food is mediocre and the service is poor. Most of the servers don't have initiative when it comes to refilling beverages, removing used plates from the table and no teamwork. I asked one server if I could get another set of silverware. The server just looked at me and called to another server that worked in our section. No courtesy and no acknowledgment."
1,"Excellent as allways, Smotherd Pork Chops, Party Wings. Yams are good enough for desert. I can't say I've ever had anything there that wasn't really good."
1,"Top notch fun , bar lounge, and food. \n\nMy guy and I  go here almost every Wednesday, when we get into town then usually two more times over the weekend. \n\nMusic- There is a dj spinning music onthe weekends and no question the best DJ in Scottsdale , playing music mash ups people actually can dance to not just a bunch of hip hop or house music. Every now and then late night the middle area turns into quite the drunk dance floor which makes for fun dancing or really fun people watching.\n\nEats- We usually load up in sashimi, which the chef came out to talk to us how it was nice to see people eating real japanese not just balls of cream cheese and rice. Everything has always been super fresh. I swear I cannot lie with out the ahi tuna sliders. We always bring a large group who always leave very happy. Its a great place to start the night at!!\n\nService- The girls are super cute but every know and then it takes a bit too long to get a drink but when you order a comlicated martini , you cant really complain!! I love the \""picachoo\"" yum yum.\n\nOverall the best scottsdale stop . A million times more fun and delish then Ra or stingray!"
1,"It was my first time dining at this casual quaint little restaurant on a busy boulevard, E. Baseline Road.  Took me a while to find it with my GPS but was glad I did.  It is a free standing adobe brick building across the street from CVS Pharmacy.  Has a small courtyard where you can dine weather permitting.  We were one of the first patrons that evening but before long, the place was quite full.  Families and couples alike choose to dine here.  I ordered the Calabrese Salami pizza and was not disappointed.  The crust was nice and crisp just like I like it and the salami was very tasty.  The Linguini with Clams was to die for!  The best I have ever had. \n\nThey serve seasonal beers and tonight's selection was an Anchor Steam Christmas Ale.  I really enjoyed it and actually had second one.  This restaurant was a recommendation from a friend who vacations in Phoenix all the time and always makes it a point to eat here.  It definitely will be on our list of places to dine when in Phoenix too."
0,Man what happened this location has gone downhill in the past few months wheres the old crew that made this location special!!!!?????
1,"This place is now called T & A Nails. I came in for a basic pedicure, which costs $25. Since I'm from LA, that is a little more than what I'm used to for this type of nail salon but the extra touches may have made up for it. First of all, I walked in on a Friday around 2pm. They already had two other people getting pedicures, but they called another woman from the back who seated me and got started right away. They seem to always do their pedicures at the massage chairs (+), and separately do manicures at the table stations - since this is what they did with the other two who were there before me. They had a large flat screen TV turned to the food network (+). The pedicure included a massage of my shins and calves that was much longer than what I expected - so it felt more like a \""spa pedicure\"" (+). It has been about a week now, and I'm pretty happy with the quality of the polish since it still looks great! I'm still shopping around nail salons, but I'll keep this one in mind."
0,"Meh, my husband and I weren't impressed at all. I had the Orchard Chicken Sandwich with Sweet Potato fries. They were both room temp which just sucks. The sandwich had great flavor but needed more of the elements, not enough caramelized onions or apples. Husband liked Cowboy burger but seasoned fries were way over the top on seasoning. Good service, great atmosphere, bleh quality. If the quality was stepped up to excellence they'd have something great going!"
1,"Get lost at Lost Leaf. It's a quaint bar serving up local wine and beer offering live musical performances every night of the week. Every show is free and the selection is enormous for such a small place. Walking in the door, you'll find casual seating and standing space where you can chat and drink. Towards the back of the bar, you'll see the stage, which is more of a recessed area in what feels more like a living room. That's what so neat about this place - you really get close and personal with the musicians. A friend of mine sings with a band called the Get Down Boys (very cool bluegrass), who played a show here one night. A bunch of us from High School packed the place and the mood was awesome! \n\nLost Leaf echoes the look and feel of old school Arizona. It's worth going for the ambiance, drinks and music!"
0,"12/3/14- Waited outside Before they opened at 8am-- they DONT let u wait inside where its warm--Was 1st to sign in my 2 kids & myself. 8:07am they were wiping down counters/ chairs-- obviously NOT prepared for the workday. 8:37am Finally called us to counter. My daughter was new, but my son & I had been there a week prior. Called us to a room after 10am. Dr.   : your son needs a nebulizer but u need to see ur pediatrician for it to be covered. If your insurance doesnt pay for it, u should get it, its only $40. I told him: Let me worry about my finances, u jus write me the Rx. Well, Amerigroup DOES pay for it written by ANY Dr & it costed over $200! For my sinus infection, only few days left of Augmentin he prescribed,Dr: I cant help u, u need to see a ear/nose/throat Dr. WTF?!! Those appts take over a mo.!!! So basically, Im done w/ antibiotics now & goin to Urgent Care on Trop/Jones, still post nasal drip/sore throat/yellow snot/mucus/raw nasal passages--praying they take my ins. They were very kind & gave me better care, w/o judgement--b4 my medical got switched. Now I have to spend another day off in a clinic b/c UMC Urgent Care wasted my time. THEY R A COMPLETE JOKE!!! Dont bother."
0,way too over priced for the food you get... \nnot my cup of tea ...
0,"I've written some reviews before, but they've always been positive.  That's not the case with this one.  We had take-out, so I can't speak to the level of service, but the food (sesame chicken, happy family, pork-fried rice) was less than mediocre -- tasteless, oily  and pricey.  We won't be giving it a second chance!"
1,"This place is awesome! It's kind of hidden in a little shopping center off Rainbow and Oakey, and was previously a tiny drive-thru Baskin Robbins. \n\nSo the first time I went with my brother, the staff was super nice and chill! We had walked up to the drive thru menu, and one of the employees walked out to meet us and let us know the low down on what was good (and walked us to the side window where no cars pass through because he's super nice!). I got an acai bowl, which you have the option of putting 3 fruits, either honey or agave nectar, and apple juice, coconut water among other possible juices. I picked mixed berries, peaches, and banana with honey and apple juice, and was not disappointed! I also got a chicken quesadilla with the spinach tortilla because I was sooo famished, and it was nothing short of delicioso. The staff really took the time to let us know what everything was and gave us their personal recommendations, and at the end they gave us a discount and upgraded our acai bowl sizes to Large and gave us free iced tea!  Needless to say, this place is amazing! Fresh ingredients and really friendly staff. The only downside is I wish this place was bigger...was closer to Summerlin....had tables...and had free wifi lol, this would be an awesome study place haha"
1,"The ramen was nothing to write home about--that being said, the pork belly buns and bulgogi buns we ordered as our appetizer were AMAZING. I'm talking melt-in-your-mouth-oh-my-god-do-i-want-twenty-more amazing! They were marinated to perfection and the meat was tender. Minus 1 star only because of the \""meh\"" ramen and sticky tables.\n\n(+) Pork belly & bulgogi buns A MUST\n(+) Small yet cozy with outdoor seating\n\n(-) Sticky tables\n(-) Ramen was just ok"
0,"Beanscene should be one of the best places in Edinburgh city centre to catch up with friends. It has live music several nights a week, a great central location and offers comfort food such as nachos and pizza to go with your coffee or smoothie.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't quite live up to what you'd expect. Unless you want greasy fast food then it's not a great place to go for lunch or dinner. If it's a coffee you're after, you'll get much better value for money across the street in The Grind House or even Starbucks. Likewise, if it's a live music venue you're after then there are plenty more in Edinburgh that aren't quite so cramped and chaotic.\n\nBasically, by trying to be too many things at once it ends up being neither. It's clean, staff are generally friendly and pleasant and it is in a good location, but still it just doesn't quite work."
0,"Sad!! The talent and creativity of their sushi chefs is unfortunately trumped by the horrific customer service due to lousy wait staff. The rolls here are creative, fresh, funky (sometimes too funky, i've had a weird choice or two that i would not choose again) and overall pretty good. But if their paying customers continue to be neglected during their visits they will inevitably fall due to low scoring reviews. My review score is based solely on the horrible service provided by their waitress last week."
1,"One of my favorite things about Vegas are it's amazing Spa's. I have been to all of them, and this one definitely stands out. It's very clean, peaceful, and accommodating. On my last visit I scheduled a mani/pedi and a massage. Their mani/pedi lasted me over two weeks. That alone sold me. Their staff was so wonderful I cant even begin to explain to you. The previous night I did the Vegas thing, so the day of my appointment I was slightly hung over and not so hot. They brought me a pitcher of water, snacks and a robe when I got cold. They really went above and beyond for me. After my mani/pedi I had my massage. Unfortunately my massage was interrupted by a family emergency. I was in the massage for less than 14 minutes, but it was a great massage while it lasted."
0,They carelessly laser the area you have chosen and cannot keep their calendar and scheduling up to date. I had to wait 1 hour for service.
1,Came here for happy hour after work. I got a beef fajita quesadilla and a couple of beers to was it down. \nThe quesadilla was really good. I asked for roasted jalape\u00f1os inside and extra crispy and they hit the mark. I couldn't have been happier. And pints for $2.50 isn't bad either. \nWhen I got in it was dead and 30 mins later the bar was packed. I felt bad for the only one bartender on duty.
1,"If you have a group, get the suite. It has 2 queen beds, a walk in shower, a bath tub, a separate toilet (closed door), 2 sinks, a roll out bed (fits 2) and another side couch so 7 people can sleep comfortably.\n\nFor $300 a night split between 7 people, pretty good deal."
0,I've been to many gyms/workout facilities in Las Vegas. The only one with a temperature higher than this was bikram  yoga.   I was hopeful when they installed ceiling fans but now there's no cool air coming from the a/c vents. I see the curtains in the Pilates room blowing and when their door opens cooler air flows out. I like to work up a sweat at the gym but not during my warm up exercises.  Sure hope this gets addressed soon

1,"I've never lived in Chicago, but I love love love their traditional eats. Pizza, beef sandwiches, and hot dogs - yum! Windy City serves up all those staples, plus a few extras like chicken wings and sausages. \nWe came in on a Saturday for lunch and they had a steady stream of customers, but we had no problem finding a table. We ordered a pepperoni thin crust, an italian beef, and a side order of fries. All were good. The beef was delicious - lean and plentiful - no fat blobs here! We ordered with cheese, sweet peppers, and giardinera (sp?), which was pretty spicy for medium. I don't think a baby like me could handle the hot. The pizza was a good, solid pie, and the leftovers tasted great the next day, too. I'll have to come back to sample the deep dish. Surprisingly, the fries were very good, sprinkled with some kind of a seasoned salt and plenty crispy.\nThey have lots of specials, like half price Fridays (I think), 50-cent wing Wednesdays, and a couple other ones I forget.\nPrices are definitely reasonable - our pizza, beef, fries, and 2 drinks came to about $26.\nFor dessert, you can go next door to Nothing Bundt Cakes or on the other side of the parking lot to Freed's.\nThe atmosphere inside is very welcoming to families - no liquor license (at least not yet), and lots of kids running around."
1,Great service!  Michelle and Kayla were both very helpful and responsive.  Will definitely use them again when I'm in Vegas.
1,"Great gluten-free pizza! Fast service and friendly servers, Greek salad a must!  Lots of seating indoors and out."
0,"Boo on the Food! This place is way over hyped. They tried to charge $7 for a little waffle and 2 cold, greasy chicken thighs. Not impressed at all. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the waiter was nice and the place looked cool. \n\nFirst impressions are everything, so they say, and in this instance I would agree. Since moving here over a year ago I have heard people go on and on about Lolo's chicken and waffles, especially when they find out I moved from the south. \""Oh it is the best soul food\"", \""They have the best fried chicken I have had anywhere..\"" are some of the things people have said. We live in Mesa and there is not a location near us but this morning  we were running errands in Phoenix and drove about 15 minutes out of our way so I could finally try this place that so many people have raved about. The place was decorated nice, it was not too long after they opened and it was not busy, we were seated right away. Took about 10 minutes before we saw a server, our drinks were brought out fairly quick and our order taken. Our food came out pretty quick but what difference does quick service make when the food is cold? The skin on the chicken was not even crisp on the edges, they had obviously been sitting around for a while. I tried a bite anyway, good fried chicken is good hot or cold and this was not good. It had the overwhelming taste of flour and I think the cook forgot to put seasoning on it at all. When the waiter came over to check on us I told him the chicken was cold and I didn't want it, at first he took the plate back and didn't say anything at all, when he brought the check he apologized. I have heard people say how good it is and maybe my experience is isolated but if it really was an uncommon experience then why didn't the waiter seemed surprised when I returned it? Why didn't he offer to get me a fresh plate? Why didn't a manager come over to see what they problem was or to apologize? Maybe they are used to serving sub-standard food, that is the only thing I can think of. This place reminds me of a lot of places that were really good until they got popular, quality of food and service goes down, prices go up and the only reason they stay in business is because they are \""cool\"" or trendy. \n\nBottom line - Don't think I will try this place again, there are so many really good restaurants to try in the Phoenix area and when you are going to spend an average of $10+  per person to sit down & eat somewhere, the food should at least be fresh. \n\nOh yeah, one more thing, a glass jar of kool-aid should never cost $3, unless you get to take the jar with you."
0,"A friend suggested that I begin my bike search here. Boy was he wrong. Maybe the West Wash location has better customer service, but after standing around bikes for 10 minutes without so much as a \""hello\"" or \""can I help you?\"" I took my business elsewhere - I ended up spending $2K+. \n\nMy suggestion: Madison has great bike shops so don't waste your time at this place."
1,"El Chorro is my favorite spot for Sunday brunch!  I ordered the omelette of the day, served with potato cake/hash browns, roasted tomatoes and a giant english muffin, the best breakfast I've had in a long time!  Not to mention their complementary sticky buns.  As if that wasn't enough, the atmosphere is unbeatable!  Shade, misters, and an exquisite view!"
1,"hella delicious sandwiches. \nI went for the original 1762 and it was like bliss touching the lips. Roast beef, cheddar chese, horseradish sauce. Super reasonable prices for anywhere and even better pricing since it is in Vegas. A sandwich is around 7 dollars. \nI don't know what it is with the bread, but it isn't a standard roll. It's sorta ciabatta-ish but not as tough. It held up to the sauces and meats inside nicely. Great bread.\nThey have grey poupon and yellow mustard at the tables. I found myself using the grey poupon as sort of taqueria hot sauce and adding it on top as I bite into the succulent sandwich.\n\nIt was so tasty, that we had it for lunch, partied, left at like 3-4am and went back for another one. I had the club this time and it was equally as good. \n\nOpen 24 hours!"
1,"We were still on the quest for GOOD pizza, this time we were way out west and decided to try NYPD.  I was leary because it looks like a nice, respectable chain-style restaurant and I picture good pizza coming from a basic local pizza joint.  Well, we were pleasantly surprised by the pizza here, and yes, it is a nice, clean, pleasant restaurant.  We ordered a margherita pizza with tomatoes, basil and fresh mozzarella and were pleasantly surprised.  The crust was really delicious (must be that NY water) and the ingredients were fresh and proportioned just right.  We ordered it crispy (as suggested on menu) and it was delish.  We took some home and had some for breakfast, also good.  It will be the place we head to for pizza when on that side of town."
0,"2 stars for free pizza. \n-3 stars for comedically bad service.\n\n\nOrdered pizza. Told 30 minutes. Waited 40 minutes.\n\nCalled back, and they said they had no idea where the delivery guy went. Apparently he went awol. 30 minutes later, the manager delivers the pizza for free. According to him, they have no idea what the hell happened to the pizza guy; said perhaps he got into an accident.\n\n30 minutes later, the first pizza guy shows up with the original pizza as if nothing happened. Really? \n\nHow hard is it to deliver pizza?\n\nTime elapsed for delivery of original (aka cold) pizza: 100 minutes.\n\nFAIL"
1,"THANK GOD FOR THE BLACKOUT SHADES! :)\n\nReally enjoyed staying at MGM! Went with the boyfriend during the week.. got a great deal on Expedia--only $5 more per night for the Grand King over the Petite King... definitely get the Grand King room if you get a similar deal.. totally worth it. \n\nPros:\n- Push a button on the wall and blackout shades come down over the window. Amazing. Felt like a rich person for sure. And made sleeping in 293472398 times better. \n- Very spacious room, really comfortable bed\n- Updated and chic decor\n- Gorgeous bathroom, huge mirror that lit up, spacious shower/tub\n- Nice big flat screen with plenty of channels\n- Although the hallway seemed noisy, couldn't hear any noise from inside our room\n- Easiest check out ever!!  Go down to the lobby, fill out a card with your name and room number, drop it in a box, and you're done. I hear they have an app you can download so you can check out on your phone as well. No waiting in lines!\n\nCons:\n- Had to do A LOT of walking...took a long time to get from the parking garage to the lobby, then to get to the room, and once you get in the casino it seems like it takes forever to get anywhere. The place is HUGE. \n- Even though it was a Wednesday, had to wait a little while at check in. \n- There is free Wifi however they don't tell you it's only free for 2 hours. \n\nHonestly can't think of many things I didn't like about this hotel... We had a great stay and will definitely be going back!"
1,The hamburger was amazing! I was a bit concerned about the condiments not being refrigerated on a wagon car but the food still blew me away. I ordered a classic. My daughter had a hot dog and it came on a hamburger bun which was interesting. My husband had the bacon one and it looked amazing. I will totally be back.
1,Good atmosphere. Cool bartenders/waitresses. Love to come here for the Greek salad with gyro meat; might be best in town. Would recommend to all.
0,"i called to order pizza, they were very polite. but when we got the pizza it tasted terrible and the wings are so small and taste lousy.. the thin crusttaste like crackers. the pizza was greasy and tastless.\nim giving it one star due to the awful tasting pizza and wings. sorry papa going to stay with barros...."
0,the lines are always ALWAYS long.  I don't get it.
1,"Soul \""I feel so hip right now\"" Gastrolounge.\n\nThis is not a place for \""soul food,\"" so don't let that portion of the name fool you.  It is the place to go for a WIDE variety of smaller, tapas style plates.  There is something here for the adventurous and the plainest of palates.  \n\nPlan to wait, upwards of 2 hours if you go on a weekend night.  I have pretty smart friends, so we came here at 7:30 on a Wednesday night and had nary a problem getting a table (with a 6 top).\n\nWe decided to order drinks at the bar while waiting on our last guest.  I was feeling crazy, and ordered a bloody mary (Absolut Peppar).  Bartender asked if I had ever tried a gin bloody mary.  I hadn't, and he gave me a sample.  I will stick to my vodka, but it was an awesome gesture. My liver says, \""thanks.\""\n\nThe food comes out as it is ready, so don't be shy to start eating if your friends haven't gotten their food yet.  Just dig in, people.\n\nPer Nicole W's 5/5 review, I ordered the Shrimp Ceviche.  It was tasty, but I don't know that I'd order it again. The plantain chips were sweet and crunchy.  The perfect addition.\n\nCheese Plate- I feel sorry for vegans.  This was excellent.  My only qualm is that our server did not tell us what cheese was what, came from what kind of mammal, etc. \n\nLamb Lollipops-Fab.  I love these suckers, pun intended.\n\nDolmades-I am spoiled in this department and partial to Kabob's.  \n\nRocket Antipasto- Great for sharing.  I could really taste the balsamic, which makes me happy.\n\nI came here last summer I think it was and they had a hush puppy stuffed with warm pimiento cheese.  It was heaven.  Please bring those to the regular menu!!\n\nSoul is a fun, tasty place!"
1,Went to get my shattered glass fixed on my galaxy note 3. Only took 3 hrs as promised. My phone is like new again!!
0,"This review is for the rude douche bag bouncers at HAZE. If I could give it a -10 I would. In fact I decided to sign up for a yelp account just for this. Anyway, from what I heard the club itself is actually not bad, but I wouldn't know since I didn't get to go in and see for myself. I was with a group of my girls and one of them brought their bf. The moment he showed his ID they asked him for his zodiac sign. WTF. not everyone knows or follow that stuff. So then the bouncer calls his \""manager\"" and asks him to look at the ID. The bouncer told him that he'd seen the same ID pass through earlier already. Again, WTF!! are you kidding me? They asked our friend to sign his signature like a couple times and kept rejecting it saying that his hand writing was not even close compared to what he had on his ID. Finally we got tired of all the BS and most of my friends just left. I, on the other hand still tried to get in because I was supposed to meet my cousin. So I spoke to the \""manager\"" and he let me and my bff get in line. Thinking it was for the VIP guest list, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. Well 20 mins. passed and still waiting in line, I decided to ask what the matter was. Turns out we still had to pay cover! After realizing this, we finally decided to jet! \n\nAnother thing about that club is that they are so unorganized! They had like 5 different lines all going on at once. Aside from the short line we were in (the reason why I thought it was guest list), there was another general line waiting to go in. Oh and the promoters up front kept running around like crazy. Like they had the worst form of communication. All in all it was just so ridiculous and such a hassle. They think their club is too good, well if you keep treating people that way no one would want to go there. There are so many hotter clubs in Vegas. PUHLEEAZE!"
0,"I went on a Thursday night before Alive after 5 - it was empty, although our waiter was attentive, he was inexperienced and made some novice mistakes. \nThe food is just ok. I had the scallop entree - pretty good but not worth the price. The place is beautiful and convenient to alive after 5 but I will not be returning."

0,"My husband and I went a few days ago while we were on our honeymoon. We had great service, we split a lobster bisque, which was absolutely delicious. My husband ordered a filet mignon and lobster as I ordered just a filet mignon. The lobster again was amazing. Unfortunately my review gets only two stars for the filet mignon. It was very dry and rubbery and lacked in flavor. We  were quiet disappointed due to this being a \""steakhouse\"".  Other then that the restaurant is great with nice tall booths and created a perfect romantic atmosphere."
1,"Great American cuisine, good variety of choices. Love all the TVs - perfect sports environment!! Great for watching games. Ordered take out several times and they have not gotten order correct a few times but for the most part very good service. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area!"
0,"I have been to this place a couple of times for business lunches and had never been disappointed with food or service until tonight.\n\nFood 2/5\n\nWe had the thai hummus and southwest burger. The hummus is actually very nice. Has a nice kick to it and you take taste the peanut sauce but its not overwhelming. The pita however was very soggy and felt like it came straight out of a microwave. The southwest burger was good, nothing more and nothing less. I did expect more 'southwest flavor' though.\n\nService 1/5\n\nAbout 2 minutes after our appetizer was brought out the server brought our entree's  'Sorry, your server put in two different tickets' was his reaction when he noticed that we had just begun eating the appetizer. When we asked our waitress she said 'its so quiet tonight that they're just really fast bringing out the food.'  \n\nWhen I notified the waitress that the fries were luke warm and that I was not happy with the whole situation she looked at us with a 'wow, I really dont care. wtf are you complaining about' attitude and asked us what we would like her to do. \nI guess it was too much to ask of her to just fix the situation. We ended up eating our appetizer as dessert -after- our entree since the entree itself wasnt warm to begin with and didnt want it to cool any further while we ate our appetizers. Then, when we *after* were finished another server brought new fries -which we did not ask for and sent back to the kitchen- ???\n\nTo top it off, our server must have noticed that we already had dessert in the form of appetizers and dropped the check at our table without asking whether we wanted dessert. And yes, you've guessed it, everything was on there we paid full price for very poor service and mediocre food.\n\nThe beer was good though but thankfully you can get that at a dozen other places throughout the valley."
0,"Oh goodness gracious, from the time we checked in to the time we left, this was a bad experience.  We stayed there last year because of an Expo we were attending and this is conveniently close to the convention center.  The \""non-smoking\"" rooms we got were reeking of smoke and all they did was come in an spray some nonsense that did not eliminate the problem.\n\nThis year, we participated as exhibitors at the same Expo and because some of the partners in the company are older, we thought it more convenient to stay at the Hilton again.  Should never have cancelled the reservations at the Embassy Suites.\n\nThe guy checking us in was a snotty little brat.  Everyone working there made it obvious they expect a tip - but hey, how about some service, or maybe even a smile to show you deserve that tip? \n\nYep, $4 bottles of water, $11 bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches, everything over-priced and just mediocre to terrible service.  We were there for 7 days and in that time I can honestly say, there were two folks working there who made us feel like guests.\n\nI agree with everyone on here - deco, atmosphere - old, rugged, boring.  Only the pool area was nice.  \n\nThe food at the Chinese restaurant was very good I must say.  And the wine at the Plaza Bar good.  Buffet was good but when you're there for a long time, you realize there isn't any variety from day-to-day.  Alas, our days were long and tiring, so decided to eat in before relaxing and hitting the strip. \n\nI read on someone else's review that he did not give this a 1-rating as there were no bed bugs, I will follow the same rules and do the same.  I fear however, this does not give the place as bad a rating as it deserves.  \n\nSheets/pillows did not smell fresh.\n\nGlad they provided shampoo, conditioner and lotion w.out charging for them as well.\n\nI could go on but I hate writing negative things.\n\nNot thrilled."
1,"1/2 lb of thinly shaved prime rib goodness, sour dough bread to die for, and au jus done perfectly.  I think I'm in love!  We also sampled the Dirty Chips....very rich and filling, plan on skipping dinner after these.\n\nThis was a fun restaurant/pub just outside of the Aria Resort.  It's impossible to pass by and not want to join in the atmosphere.\n\nLots of great choices on the menu and plenty of beers to choose from.  I especially enjoyed the bar table tops that have the self serve keg draw on it!  That could be trouble."
1,"In a city filled with name brand restaurants and chefs, the best food we had was also the cheapest - Grimaldi's. Excellent pizza, excellent service. Sometimes, chains are chains for a reason - because they've got something good and are smart enough to duplicate it over and over again."
1,"\""It's the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki ROOM. \nIt's the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki ROOM.\""\n\nI love how people complain about it being tacky, dirty and whatnot. For fuck's sake, it's the epitome of a DIVE. Dives are supposed to be that way! Remember: they are dark so that you can't see the 'roaches.\nI love this place! It's up there on the Top 3 Dives. I mean: kitsch decoration, missing toof women bartenders, great music, cheap strong drinks and PBR served in a pitcher -yes, you must drink it out of the pitcher- for $3. I MEAN, what more can you ask for?\nNot sure if it's still the case, but Tuesdays are great. It's pants off, dance off time!"
1,"Next month, I'll be crossing off the 49th state to enter the Union. Alaska, doncha know? And because my friends are planning on taking me to see the Northern Lights, it's gonna be seriously cold. Like 20 below if I'm lucky. So I need gear. Where else to go but Bass Pro for their huge selection and reasonable prices?\n\nI managed to find some inexpensive boots and socks that will keep my feet warm, a good hat to keep my head and face toasty, and a few other odds and ends that should be good for the Arctic weather I am expecting.\n\nBass Pro also has tons of other goodies, like hunting and fishing equipment, camping gear, exercise wear and of course, everyone's looking for their Duck Dynasty goodies. Here's the place for all of it and more. Need an ATV or an outboard motor? How's about a kayak or a tent? Yep, Bass Pro has it."

1,"KC had been to the social house before, but this was my first time. The ambiance is nice, with a dimly lit dining area and friendly waiters. Apparently, the hot thing to do there is to let the waiters bring you food until you're full. Though the food they bring out is good, don't expect it to be cheap. When the bill arrived, I realized that the waiter had done double orders on some of our dishes, especially the expensive ones. Though the Kobe beef was excellent, we would have been sufficient with 6 pieces instead of the 12 that he brought on a single plate. Also, since we didn't order, all of our dishes came sashimi style. Though it accentuated the flavor of the dishes, I left the restaurant still a bit hungry while my wallet was already dry."
0,"I was really excited to try this place because of the good reviews, however I was disappointed. When we first arrived there was nobody waiting and only 2 tables had people at them however we had to wait 25 minutes to be seated. When we finally got a seat we ordered drinks from the bar they were out of three different things we ordered. The food was not that good. My chicken was dry and the chef popped hot oil on me and burnt me. Food was definitely too pricey for the quality. The sake was good and the staff was friendly but I would not recommend."
0,"I am not often inspired to write a review but last nights experience should be shared. We arrived about 7:15pm and sat down for a BBQ feast. We were served drinks and placed our order with the bartender. The place was not busy by any standards with maybe 4 people at the bar. by 8:15 we had not even been served our salad. I asked the bartender where our food was he said he had checked on it and it would be just a minute. the food runner came out with a platter of food and tried to deliver it to the folks next to us at the bar that had come it a half hour after us. The bartender interrupted this and said it was ours. It was not ours. The bartender then asked us what we had ordered and we told him a Cesar salad and the bbq sampler . It became clear that he never put in the order. He did not admit this to us but said he would pick up a round of drinks.Another 15 mins passed and they brought our salad. I told the bartender that we needed food and if it was going to be more than 5 mins we would just go elsewhere. He went into the back and said that they were \""really backed up\"". We asked for the check he brought us a check for $39 fro the drinks we had. I spoke with the manager and he did pick up the tab and offer to box our meal when it was ready. We were so hungry that we had already called Cornish Pasty to order food. When we got there 10mins later our food was ready even though the had just gotten a party of 60 ahead of our order. I worked in restaurants in every position for 10yrs. I never made a mistake that big and if i had I would have admitted it. After 1.5 hrs we left never receiving our food from bootleggers"
1,"As a native East Coaster, for YEARS, I have heard about the myth & the mystery surrounding In & Out Burger. I've been to California multiple times; it eludes me why I never made it to In & Out Burger then. Then recently, I was visiting my brother in Las Vegas when I saw the In & Out Burger sign. For some reason, I assumed it was a California thing, as opposed to a West Coast thing. Easy decision. I had the Double Double. I'm a fan, no doubt. Certainly one of the Top 5 burgers I've had ever. Everything about it is right: it's simple, it's juice, the beef really stands out. With things like heart disease, it's a good thing I don't live on the West Coast!"
0,"Just ate here for the first time, and I gotta say, I'm disappointed with all the hype I've heard. First, the romaine in my salad was brown on the ends so it obviously wasn't fresh. Second, my soup and bread bowl came out colder than room temperature and I had to send it back, which I hate doing being a server myself. Third, we told our server, skinny girl with long black hair and purple on top that our parking meter was about to run out so we needed our check. She walked past us again a few minutes later with no check, said nothing, and then another couple of minutes later we see her seating a party of twenty and taking all of their drink orders! Get out of here!! I had to leave the table and go pull the car out while my boyfriend waited for our check another 10 minutes. UNREAL! We still left almost 20%, but I hope she realizes she missed out on the usual 30-40% we normally leave both being servers ourselves. Lastly, a little too pricy for what you get. Don't think we'll be back."
0,"If this restaurant were in a different place with a different wait staff, this would be a five star review all the way. The food is exceptionally good.\n\nBut let's start out our dining experience with getting to the restaurant. The website states that it's across the street from the monorail. Technically, it is. It's also about two sketchy blocks down Sahara. Is it me, or has the area surrounding the Strip really become run-down over the past 10 years? My colleagues were looking at me like \""what kind of crappy restaurant are you taking us to\"" as we made the trek. When we walked in, it looked like a place that once upon a time was a nice place, but it's struggled to keep up with the times.\n\nThen there's the service. A smarmy know-it all Maitre 'd/waiter took care of us. Don't ask him for anything that's not on the menu; he will yell at you. The rest of the wait staff looked like they walked in from the set of Goodfellas... you got the feeling that these guys had screwed up everything they had ever done so they were thrown into the restaurant where they could presumably do less damage. So we had bread thrown onto our plates and were constantly being growled at when we weren't listening to the Maitre'd berate the staff for doing things wrong. At any moment, I expected Gordon Ramsey to walk in and start filming Kitchen Nightmares, call this guy a donkey, and march him outside to cuss him out.\n\nBut the truly bizarre moment came when our customer (who I will admit is Chinese and her English is fair but not great) asked if she could have a salad as an appetizer. Smarmy guy got downright rude and told her no, we don't serve those. We will give you a vegetable plate. Customer looks at us quite perplexed. Our international sales manager tried to explain that the lady would like a salad, and perhaps you could prepare one for her? \""Alright, fine, since you don't understand how we do things, we'll just do this now...\"" and pulls out a giant basket of vegetables and some dijon vinaigrette to dip it in. \""There, now are you happy?\""  Several awkward minutes after we had our fill he returned to take our order.\n\nThe entrees and soup were nice. Had the service not been so awful, we might have a better feeling about this place. The much hyped chocolate lava cake was overcooked, so there was no molten center. It was a poor ending to a comical meal. \n\n15 years ago when my boss last dined here, this was a fantastic restaurant, but like the neighborhood it's in, it's in decline."
1,"So, I never Yelp. In fact, I'm not sure I have ever written a review of any kind. However, after Emily B saved the day I had to. I emailed The Root after reading about them on Yelp and received a call back right away to schedule a consultation. They were able to book my appointment for two days later, after Emily volunteered to come in early for me. I was already impressed, but after arriving to my appointment I was greeted by a friendly, welcoming staff, offered a drink and felt right at home. \n\nEmily knew exactly what I was looking for and was able to salvage a not-so-hot haircut I had received a week before at a different salon. She totally understood my vision and we had a great color consultation - which I was really nervous about before talking with her. I am definitely going to book with her again - and soon! I love my new cut and am happy to say I have definitely found the right place/stylist to make my hair look awesome. Would recommend Emily B to anyone, but all of the other stylist were super friendly too and seem to have a very loyal following!"
1,"I give props to the Hispanic dude that works the back kitchen..he served me my Sicilian slice for $3.75 and made our sandwiches; vegetable with mozzarella,and a simple cheese slice. This place is very cheap and it's a great cafe to spend easy money. They serve simple pastries, gelato's, and great coffee.\n\nI also purchased their Italian beer for $4! It tasted like a heineken.\nI'll be coming back again."
1,"Although I don't fully understand the Chicken & Waffles phenomena, I thought this place was really good. I'm not a huge fan of waffles (like them, don't love them) so I got the \""Lil C\"", Two thighs and Mac and cheese. I also ordered a side of fried okra and a sweet tea. The chicken, Mac & Cheese, and Sweet Tea were all exactly as I hoped they'd be. The okra, not so much. First of all the server forgot to bring it, then when I reminded him he then forgot the Ranch that I ordered (otherwise he was a nice, attentive server). I'm giving a 4 just due to the okra issues, but honestly the food that I did enjoy deserves a five. I'll skip the okra next time and be pretty happy.\n\n     This place has all of the fried chicken puns as well. \""Purple Drank\""? Did Dave Chappell write the menu? Hilarious.\n\n     The food is reasonably priced but Dranks are pretty expensive. $3.50 for Kool-Aid? Get those refills!\n\n     If you're on the fence about going here let me push you over. Go here! It's good! I didn't post any pictures because the #13 is already on there. Enjoy."
0,"Wanted to see why the reviews are so high for this place.  I have to say it was an experience to try at least once while visiting Pittsburgh.  We sat at the counter and that was a fun to eat there.  We shared a Pastrami sandwich and I thought the meat portions were small, mostly cold slaw and fries in your sandwich.  The pastrami was average and I would have liked more of that then the other items.  It was a big sandwich and enough for us.  We didn't have to order any fries, but we forgot it was in the sandwich.  The fries could be crisper and I thought they were tasty, but too soft for me.\n\nOverall, I say go there once to experience it.  There's not a lot of attention from the staff, bc the place is so busy.  I don't need to go back.   If you miss getting a chance to eat there.....then catch it the next time you visit, not a must to visit."
1,"I used to live across the way so i ate there a lot.  I'm basing my review on the fact its mixed of all the times I've eaten there... I only had one meal which was very lemony and very salty and ... it was during happy hour, and the waitress brought new and also didn't charge me.  \nGET THE ROASTED VEGETABLES.  AMAZING.  I beg for the dressing recipe everytime I go.  They also have a salad with corn in it which will last for three days its so big.  \nmy girlfriend gets salmon everytime and says its the best in the valley.  Shes well traveled.\nLOVE THIS PLACE, it gets hoppin on fridays and especially on first friday."

1,Okay....this hotel is by far amazing..... upon check in since we were celebrating a 30th birthday we got an AMAZING UPGRADE to a huge suite!!!  So that was awesome!!!!!..... \n\nDownside.... Later that night I notice they had drafted out a $600.00 charge on my debit card that was not disclosed upfront for any charges on the room!!!!! I was very unhappy about it..... it wasn't pending it was TAKEN straight out of my funds..... \n\nThe Marquee Day Club........it is a cool scene however $500.00 tab to rent a lawn chair...PASS!!!!!!!  And while we were getting a drink at the bar my GF laid her phone on the bar and while she was turned away the bartender chick totally stole her IPHONE....No one else was even around so we know it was her....... The hotel security would not do anything because they said they are not affiliated with THE MARQUEE DAYCLUB....So keep an eye out.... they are shady folks working out there!!! \n\nBond was super cool place to hang out and watch the girls in the boxes put on little shows! =-) \n\nRoom services .... $$$$$$.....but pretty good.... but not amazing.... \n\nOverall....Very glam place.... just very expensive as well but if you have $$ to blow then its your type of enviornment!!! =-))))
1,"A great alternative if you haven't been able to visit the original Serendipity in NY. I love the cute decor inside! Though the Frozen Hot Chocolate isn't exactly the same as Serendipity3 in NY, it's still pretty good!"
1,"Rocky Road Bread Pudding.  Need I say more??  No really. That should be the end of my review.  Because that's all you need to know.  That they have Rocky Road Bread Pudding.  And it's DELICIOUS.\n\nI've also had their sandwiches (WHOA food - no kidding, a sandwich can feed 2 people easily - they're huge) along with their homemade chips (yum!), and also I have had a pasta chicken dish that was tasty as well (not fireworks status but tasty nonetheless).\n\nTheir coffee is spectacular (read: strong) as is their red sangria (don't worry, didn't try them at the same time).\n\nOverall I love this place.  Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because their homemade chips aren't consistent - sometimes REALLY good, sometimes just \""meh\"".\n\nWhen in the area you must stop in.  Don't forget to try their bread pudding!!"
0,"Following Josh D's review on 11/1 - I totally agree that  AJ's has a cooked food problem.\nAt the soup bar yesterday I stood with 2 strangers (read snowbirds) 1 of which has been an AJ's patron since it opened. All of us agreed the soups, whilst having interesting names were all very runny and had no substance.\nThey lost 3 sales in as many minutes - I should also add being a long term Cave Creek resident this has been a problem since earlier in the year - comments have been made to the on site management to no avail.\nI have also tried the AJ's on Pima and they are having the same issues - looks like the whole organization needs a kick up the pants....\nTheir pricing is expensive and we the customers expect value and quality for our money.."
0,The falafel is not fresh and clearly not made there. They heat it up but it's clearly made by a machine and frozen )); sad because falafel is so simple to make. \n\nThere is no yogurt sauce or tahini sauce..just ranch and chipotle barbecue and salad dressings..strange pairing for a Mediterranean place. \n\nWe were here at 3:25pm and they started closing up while we were eating. Shut all the lights off and locked things up. They weren't supposed to close until 6pm... \n\nThey were also really stingy with the fries and tabbouleh. \n\nIdk not much going for this place other than it's different for vegas. So expensive too for what it is.
1,"The KEG has never disappointed.  I frequently go there for special occasions.  There steak and fries are so delicious!  And for dessert, their cheesecake is the best I have ever eaten.  It easily makes the Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake taste terrible.  Like heaven in a bite.  Their servers are always nice and the manager makes sure to come buy and see if everyone is doing good.  That is one thing that is special to the KEG that I love."
0,"This is definitely not a place I would recommend. The lady giving me my pedicure cut me twice! Although the owner was very friendly the lady giving me my mani/pedi was rude. I definitely agree with the other reviewers in regards to the clealiness of the salon, it's pretty dingy on the inside. I will definitely not be going back."
1,"I saw \""Oblivion\"" the other day in the DFX auditorium of the Cannery's Galaxy Theatre.  DFX stands for Digital Fusion Experience, which is a wall to wall and ceiling to floor huge screen.  I could tell as soon as we walked into the theatre that this really is the \""largest viewing experience in the region,\"" just like the Galaxy website touts. And, it has Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound, which just means it's nice and loud.  I saw the movie with friends at 5:00pm on a Sunday and, at first, there was no one else in the theatre--yay, for a private screening!  Some other people eventually came in, too.  Next time, I'll make sure we sit in the last row because that screen is so big.  I don't know if it was the theatre and all its bells and whistles, but we walked out of there raving about Tom Cruise.  I just know the movie looked and sounded spectacular on that huge screen.  A big plus to this theatre is the separate entrance so moviegoers can avoid walking through the casino.  Even though this is not near me, with the summer movie season upon us, I'll be back to see a blockbuster or two here.  They also have something called a D-Box theatre where the seats move with the action.  As long as I don't need to take Dramamine, I'll try that next."
0,"I'll admit that I'm not the club-going type person that I used to be. I used to love the clubs, dance while I'm wasted, and being in a dim atmosphere with loud music blasting against my earlobes. Now I just \""like\"" it. Truth be told, I'd rather be gambling with a beer or jack and coke in my hand at the tables than be at a club. But since Haze had just opened when we went there in January, we figured we might as well find out if it was poppin or not. \n\nSo going into Haze with my girlfriend and our friends, we (the guys) knew were going to be paying a ridiculous amount for cover and knew the girls would either get in free or get charged pennies compared to what they guys were getting charged. Among a group of 13 people -- 8 girls and 5 guys -- the girls were charged $5 and the guys were charged $30. Typical. No harm there. Then we went inside... and then the words \""Haze fucking sucks\"" started to spew from our mouths.\n\nThe dance floor is pretty damn small. If you're not sitting in the VIP area, you can forget about finding a place to sit to rest your aching feet because you can't sit on the platforms and you sure as hell can't sit on the floor. Why? Well the tough bouncer let it be known that it's made for dancing on and only girls are allowed on the freaking platforms. As if there was a list of rules we were supposed to read before we went inside this club... \n\nThe drink prices are retarded. $18 plus tip for a shot of Patron? And you're charging us for water? You're joking right? I'll walk back to the Sky Suite lobby and get my own damn water if I need to. And I did. \n\nThe music selection was pretty typical for a Las Vegas club. Not too much hip hop but plenty of dance music that will keep your head throbbing for days. Normally, this isn't a problem for me because I'm a DJ as well, but whoever was spinning that night has some kind of obsession with Katy Perry and the Black Eyed Peas. If you're going to play songs from these artists for a good hour and a half straight, you must not be that good or you don't have a good library to load up on Serrato. \n\nThe bathroom line for the guys was pretty easy to shift through. For the girls, not so much because there's always a huge line for it. It kinda makes up for the guys having to get charged up the ying yang to get in. Yeah, that's right ladies. Your payback is through your bladder.\n\nAlso, somewhere through the night, confetti began to rain down from the ceiling and a couple people dressed up all \""tranny-like\"" walked through the dance floor on stilts. It was very much a WTF moment and also a signal to me and my girlfriend that we need to get the hell out of there. \n\nIf you read through this long review of Haze, I'm sorry it was long but I have issues with this place. Haze has nothing on Tryst or XS. You're better off spending your money there and you definitely won't be charged for a glass of water there. This place just does not stack up to  some of the better clubs on the Strip nor does it really feel like it belongs at Aria. \n\nAvoid this club like the plague."
1,"Bella Serra is an Italian gem in downtown.\n\nThey have some of the best, most delicious wine options - including organic. What really impressed me was their effort at sustainability and buying local when they can.\nThe only reason they didn't get 5 stars was because the menu is slightly limiting. But the food is great!"
0,"This would have been a one star review if my first experience was as bad.\nI got Togo last time (last week) at 9pm. I ordered Mongolian beef and it was fantastic. It was very flavorful and the beef was not those typical fast-food/cheap beef. It was great. 5 star for the food.\n\nYesterday I ordered Beef Pepper Steak. One word. Terrible. 1 star for the food.\nI'm a Chinese so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to Chinese food. The beef is too soft, it feels like it was soaked in baking soda for way too long. The whole thing does not taste like the chef saut\u00e9 it or put any effort in it. Basically it tastes like he just threw everything in the wok and poured sauce, stirred it and serve. Im telling you, the China One owner, the beef was just WARM and it became cold within 10 minutes. The rice is not even hot. The bottom is cold. \n\nWhen I was there, they were having Dinner. That might be why the chef didn't cook well this time. I will go back and give you a third try one more time."
1,"Nice place to run and bike with incredible views of the city. I prefer the wooded trail portion because I'm not running on pavement, it's easier on my knees (I'm old). Lots of places to park along the trail, like Washington's Landing and near Heinz Lofts. The scenery makes this one of my favorite running spots, but there are definitely more people on bikes than on foot. As long as you can dodge them and trust that they'll dodge you, it makes for a really wonderful workout. Where else can you run along side a submarine?"

1,"Years ago, my friend Jen raved about the steamed bagel sandwiches that she'd eaten while attending school in Ohio.  She couldn't contain her excitement about Bagel & Deli coming to Charlotte, and right down the road from her house no less!  I'll admit that I was somewhat dubious about the idea of something tasty coming from Ohio, and the idea of steaming a bagel just seemed strange and inappropriate, like eating chili on spaghetti noodles.  Steamed bread?  I cringed at the thought of the microwave sandwiches I ate in elementary school.  Boy, was I wrong.  Steamed bagels ARE good.  I like them, I like them, Sam I Am.  \n\nIf you're heading to Owens for the first time, prepare yourself for being overwhelmed by the menu options.  You're going to go all deer-in-the-headlights and stuff.  Not only is the printed menu extensive, but there are construction paper signs hanging on a line displaying some of their more creatively titled menu items; hung there to distract you and cause you to inexplicably stare for minutes on end.   There is a seemingly endless list of fantastic sandwiches for you to choose from, or you can create and name your very own bagel sandwich creation.  \n\nI've only had one sub-par experience here but it was during a weird time of day when I'd imagine the third stringers were in the game.  I think that the vast majority of people are like me and enjoy eating at Owens after a long night out with friends, but this is a great place for breakfast or lunch any old day."
1,"This is a very clean course not to over the top but what a location.  This area is developing so fast, the course brings increased value to the growth."
1,Seigon Kitchen is an excellent place to eat. All the food is wonderful especially the sizzling cake.They make the best fish sauce I have ever tasted. I am always telling the very nice lady that she should bottle it. Great food and the nicest people you could ever meet. Go! Enjoy!
1,"Wow! The employees and owner here provided the BEST customer service for my mom, future mother-in-law, future sister-in-law and young nieces. The mothers tried on several dresses and the saleswomen were SO helpful and sweet. They have a huge selection of bridesmaids dresses as well- a little more spendy than David's Bridal but it is worth it for the quality and selection. I am the bride and was able to order my invitations the same day we were there. I didn't have an appointment but the owner, Kim was very willing to help me anyway. She sat with me and designed a custom invitation for an hour and she helped me get exactly what I wanted within my budget. It is very rare to visit a business with such amazing care for their customers these days!"
0,"We have not been to native in quiet a long time.  We decided to go to here and the service was horrible.  The food was just ok.  We tried to mention to the manage of the bad service and it seem to go in one ear and out the other.  The bar area is very loud and the bartender and service in the bar area was aweful.  They are very rude and just seem very uninterested in waiting on tables.  I would rather make the drive elsewhere to have better service than at this place!  If you can avoid it, that would be my suggestion."
0,"Haven't been here in years, it's not as good as I remember and assuredly won't be back. Prime lunch time, few customers inside. Good was cooked well but seemed over cooked and few selections. Bathrooms simply NASTY and dimly lite. Many other fine dining options in this location. \n\nGOTTA BE KIDDIN..."

0,"Well, once in a lifetime is enough for this I think. I have been there multiple times when friends and family come to visit and am disappointed each time. If you are under 21 they do not even let you come into some of the hotels, not even to get advertised food specials or use the restroom! Not that I would eat the food that came out of any of those hotels but just a heads up! Everything is overpriced, but not as much as the strip. You can get bottle Corona for $2 at some bars which is a deal I have to admit compared to the $9 beers on the strip.\n\nThe whole street is filled with kiosks selling shirts and other little things, nothing too exciting except for one that does spray paint art in layers live, which is really cool but it draws a big crowd of rude tourists so it's not a place to be for any amount of time. There are also impersonators (some good some should rethink their costume) that will take a picture with you for a \""mandatory donation.\"" I have never done the zip line but it is quite spendy for just going over a bunch of people, not that good of a view! \n\nThe overhead lights is the ONLY reason this dump gets 2 stars, I have to admit that it is pretty cool and I have never had a visitor say that they didn't like it. It is short though but what can you say, it's free which isn't a common price in Vegas.\n\nBeware if you go, this is where the transients, pimps, prostitutes and loonies hang out! If you like people watching in it's craziest it is entertaining but don't go down a back ally. It is near the Greyhound station as well as the slum of Vegas and the homeless shelter. Not a good area to be in at night! Also getting to the highway is an ABSOLUTE nightmare. They have no signs and they expect you to remember random almost ally streets to find it."
1,"Hubby & I decided to try this place after a movie last night... and the major failing was a lack of wheelchairs to take us out of there after we totally stuffed ourselves.\n\nHubby got a loaded shake, the Drunken Monkey... it was supposed to be a banana/peanut butter/chocolate shake but no banana flavoring was detected.  He said it was still excellent, just not what he thought he was ordering.\n\nAppetizers... we got the fried pickles, which were very good... and the fried green tomatoes, which were extremely excellent.\n\nI got the mini-buns with the asian pork belly, which I loved, and a side order of fries (ridiculous quantity, but good).  Hubby got the Korean Bull-gogi burger, and it was fantastic.\n\nOne of the rare places where a medium burger is actually cooked to medium instead of well done.\n\nIngredients were fresh, food was excellent.. they even make their own mayonnaise & ketchup (Udder sauce) in house.\n\nWe will definitely be returning to sample more items.. oh, and they gave us a 15% off locals discount, which we hadn't expected.. very nice!"
0,"Never again will I return to Papa Johns - not only was the food horrible but this isn't the first time the food was below good. The pizza we got tasted old, like it was pulled from the frig and placed in the oven. Among other things, my wife placed a order and used her credit it card and I was to pick it up, when I got there the manage asked for the card. Luckily I had it, but the last name on her card hasn't been changed yet. Keep in mind when I called, the call taker said it wouldn't be a problem. Well there was a problem - Vince the store manage was less then nice to me. I should have walked out but instead, used my card for the food. The manage was rude and not understanding and proceeded to tell me if I used the card on line, he wouldn't have needed to see the card - I told him that didn't make sense. Maybe it's this Papa John, I always seem to have issues with this location from my ordering being cancled at one time ( they said I called back and told them never mind) to waiting 2 hours for my pizza to arriave at my house. Never have had problems at the Pizza Hut or Marco's."

1,"I'm surprised that I'm giving this place five stars, but it really lives up to all of its promises. \n\nI've been in twice, and both times we were treated great. The first time we went and set at a long bar overlooking three huge-screen TV's. We ordered two of the beer towers and some appetizers. Our waitress was great - there when we needed her, not in our face. We were probably a little loud as well, but that fit right in. Our check wasn't bad either, for three people we spent about $15 each. \n\nLast Friday, I went in for some afternoon bar therapy and to watch the first few UFC fights. The two bartenders, whose names I forget, were spectacular. They had the bar under control, great teamwork. Overall, it was another great experience, exactly what I was looking for. \n\n5/5 for being everything a Sports Bar should be."
1,"This is the Sephora at the Grand Canal Shoppes at The Venetian.\n\nOhhh how i LOVE this place!!!! Conveniently located at one of my FAVORITE HOTELS, they have an endless abundance of skincare, cosmetics from all sorts of good quality brand of makeup, men and women designer fragrances, makeup tools and other small makeup accessories.\n\nI try to come here and buy something whenever I come to Vegas. So far, they have never ran out of an item i was looking for. The sale associates are really helpful but at the same time they leave you when you're just browsing or freely shopping around.\n\n\n\n-Cynthia-"

1,"I'm gonna make this quick because I'm still here eating and I've got the Fat Choy Burger on the way.  I still even have the buffalo sauce on my fingers from the wings.  This place has the best traditional wings in Vegas. Period.  I could walk away right now and be perfectly happy. \n\nThe burger just got to my table, I took a bite, and I'm now currently debating whether or not I want to bum-rush the kitchen and hug the cook.  \n\nJust come here.  Seriously."
0,"5 stars for the ambiance, 5 stars for the waiter and service.  Zero or minus stars for the vastly overpriced small portions of food that had no proper spicing or taste.  Our table of five agreed that the experience was \nNot ever going back to Lon's."
1,"Ok, just back from my second visit. After my first visit and review, I received/exchanged a few emails with the manager. It appears that she/they are very open to feedback and interested in improving. Kudos for that. I was offered a few meal on my next visit, which I declined. I wasn't looking for freebies, instead wanted to help this place improve and prosper. \n\nGuess what ! ? ! ? On this visit, almost all of my prior critiques had been addressed/fixed. My server this time was Britt (no cutesy fake names). She immediately asked if it was my first visit at Snooze and this location in particular. I asked if the Corned Beef Hash was available in a half order. She seemed a little stumped, but instead of a direct yes/no answer, she asked if I wanted one egg or two and if I wanted toast. (I asked for one egg and no toast). I also ordered a half order of the carrot cake pancakes. \n\nAfter a very short wait, my food came out. It was a large portion of hash, with one soft poached egg (exactly as ordered). So many places seem to have trouble getting soft poached eggs, but here it was perfect. Firm white, and completely soft, runny yolk.  All nice and hot. The corned beef hash was some of the best I have ever had. Nicely shredded potatoes mixed with pulled corned beef. Obviously fresh-made and not some prefab, out of the package stuff.. The carrot cake pancake was delish as well. It was like eating that piece of carrot cake for breakfast...I almost convinced myself it was a daily helping of vegetables. And best of all, the food all came out hot...\n\nI got to the restaurant just before 9am. As I was seated, I noticed two female managers just finishing up what appeared to be a manager meeting over breakfast. They were just finishing up, and got up shortly after I was seated. I did not see either one of them again until just as I was finishing up. At that point, one of the managers delivered a pancake flight to the table next to me. Other than that, no \""table visits\"" were witnessed, even though the restaurant was full. The good news is that If a table visit had been made, the only  critique offered would have been \""Good job, things are great\""..\n\nAs I was eating, my server did a couple of \""check backs\"" and offered soda refills (I don't do coffee).  When she brought the check, I noticed that instead of a \""half order charge\"" for the hash, I was charged for a side of hash and a side of one egg. Not  a big deal, but IMHO, the server should have stated up front that while it wasn't available as a \""halfsie\"", it could be ordered as sides..I am not sure if my side of hash was the same portion as a full order or if it was less/ more. \n\nQuick credit card processing by Britt completed the dining experience. On my way out, the cashier/hostess genuinely thanked me for my visit. \n\nAfter two visits, Snooze has now moved up to one of my favorite breakfast places."
0,"I am normally very generous in my rating and this is no exception.  We have been to Zipps at least 10 times times and as long as you are ordering drinks, it is ok but when you add food it is REALLY hit or miss, mostly miss. The food is not bad, once you get it. It is rarely warm and prepared the way you request. The excuse is ALWAYS \"" the kitchen is back up\"". Really too bad Zipps, you could really be a great place but you have proven time and again that you cannot get it right."
1,Always great things from a PF Changs.
1,"Simple and bomb food. Nice little nook in the wall, great to chill and enjoy pizza."
1,"I was at the Silverton this week for an event, not to stay overnight, but I have to wonder why I hadn't been back in years.  This is a very nice casino, albeit small.  They have a great selection of gambling options, plus they have the giant aquarium thingy, which is pretty cool and this neat little area where they have what I would call miniature bowling inside an Airstream trailer, INSIDE A BAR.  Yeah, I know.  It sounds weird, but it's kind of funky and neat and provides a fun atmosphere.\n\nThe staff I spoke to here or interacted with, whether at bars or at the players club desk, were all friendly.  I know I've eaten at their buffet in the past, but I can't remember what I thought of it.  Of course, it is also connected to the Bass Pro Shop, too, so it's kind of got a lot going on for such a small place and a large parking lot!\n\nOn this occasion, I attended an event inside the Veil Pavilion and I thought it was a nice location for a small to medium sized event.  Definitely something to keep in mind if you're looking for event space.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I got this reminder.  I think we'll be back and maybe even look into staying here a couple of nights.  My understanding is that the prices are pretty reasonable."
0,"I used to go here often when I went to MCC.  I admit that the food was pretty good, but the owner ruined the entire experience for me.  At the time, I was learning Japanese and wanted to try it out in an actual setting.  He yelled at me the first time I tried and told me to speak English.\n\nAnother instance, and the real reason I don't go back there, is when a friend of mine went to eat there.  After he finished, he said \""Gochisousamadeshita\"" (a polite saying thanking the preparer of the food for the meal) and the owner muttered under his breath \""Henna Gaijin\"" (strange foreigner).\n\nI can understand not having the patience to speak Japanese with me, but really.....insulting someone who just thanked you for the food?  That's enough for me to never return."
1,"We \""inherited\"" white carpet in the home we bought six years ago, while we never would install white carpeting in a home, we've dealt with it, because the carpet was new when we purchased the home, and it's a good grade.  However it comes with the utmost in responsibility regarding up keep.  Elite Floor & Furniture Cleaning did a remarkable job with it.  Perfect visit, from being on time, to cleaning the carpets, to the DRYING time (they started around 10-11 and it was dry when we got home from work), to leaving us with booties, additional spot cleaner and a brush.  I would strongly recommend them, and their number is on my speed dial.\n\nUPDATE 2/5/2014\nMy husband and I also own a store at 16th Street and Camelback where we have commercial grade vinyl \""hardwood\"" flooring installed.  Justin came in and not only cleaned it to where it looked new again, but was knowledgeable on the material used, and gave us pointers on how to easily keep it clean.  I still use him for our home carpeting, and now the business flooring as well.  He also does a wonderful job on throw rugs!"

0,"I'm amazed some places can stay open for business for so long despite being so clearly consistently horrible. Why oh why didn't I check the Yelp reviews?!\n\nThis is the worst buffet I've ever been to. The worst Chinese food I've ever had. The food has clearly been sitting out for hours. Multiple items are unlabelled and the ones that are labelled are pretty much done with Sharpies on a greasy sneeze guard. I've never seen so little effort put into presentation. I'm still having nightmares about the chocolate pudding just plopped into a metal insert. I don't have to tell you what it looked like. Chinese sticky buns (dessert) placed beside meat items because why not, I guess?\n\nAnd that doesn't even touch on the food. Oh, the food. If only my party had listened to the voice telling us \""Something seems odd about how this tastes...\"" 2 out of 3 of us were throwing up within the hour. I will say we both felt MUCH better after this.\n\nThe only good part of our dining experience was how much we were able to laugh at how ridiculous the whole place was. Reading terrible reviews from fellow Yelpers got us through part of the night.\n\nI will say our server was quite nice and attentive. Yay.\n\nFor the love of all that is holy, stay away. In a busy and bustling Chinatown, we somehow chose this place. Don't make the same mistake."
1,"This brand-new CVS just opened a few weeks ago and it's a HUGE improvement to the neighborhood! They tore down an old crappy shopping center to build this store, and it's cleaned up the Thomas/24th St. intersection a lot.\n\nThe store iteself is clean, bright, and has everything you would expect a CVS to have. They have a great selection of store brand products and there are plenty of checkouts to get you in and out quickly.\n\nAdded bonus: they have carts with little cars that your kids can sit in. A big deal if you have an energetic 2 year old that doesn't like to sit in the shopping cart."
1,Great place to have sandwich  ... People bored to subway have to try  .. U will love it.. I tried black bean patty.. \nWhich wich do you want ?
0,I first found this restaurant when they first opened and had a great time there with great food.  Good tasting/friendly service.\n\nLast trip there was a flop.  Pho was lacking and 6 people in our party orded rice dishes.  The meat was mediocre and the tau-hu-ky smelled.  No one finished their soup and we couldn't eat the rice dishes.  I vow not to ever go back there.
1,Crabcake sanwich is great
1,"The best chocolate chip cookies in town!  All of the baked muffins, cookies are really fantastic here but the triple chocolate chip cookies are amazing!  Delicious healthy salads and sandwiches, Chloes Corner never disappoints!  Friendly service, clean restaurant and bathroom.  Haven't been for breakfast/brunch yet but the lunch menu is solid and this place is always very popular and busy!"
1,"Moon is one of the best clubs i've been too. What was great the night i went, when the dj played Kung Foo Fighting, they opened up the roof and ninjas came down and were doing kung foo!! its alwtas great to see a club do little extras. the only set back are the drink prices...sure they're the same price as every other club in vegas, but the glasses arre smallllll"
1,"This is the perfect place if you want generous portions and great food at a reasonable price!! It's a little off the strip, but I think it's definitely worth trying. It's located in a small sketchy looking plaza, and may get crowded at times.\n\nI ordered the bulgogi plate whereas my friends got the meat jun combo. Our meals came with a small assortment of fresh banchan. I really liked the kimchi, seaweed salad, and boiled nuts. Before our entrees came out, I was already full from stuffing myself with the banchan. \n\nThe bulgogi was very delicious! I enjoyed every little bit of it - even the leftovers. The meat jun was pretty good as well. And all for around $10. What a steal! My only gripe is that they mixed up my order, which led to a bit of a delay with my entree. But luckily the banchan was there to satisfy me in the meantime. Also their cups have a strange yellow tint we just could not figure out."
1,"We were worried when the change happened, but honestly I like the food better.  The only thing we do miss is the green rice from Super Mex was much better and we like green chili verde, not red.  Besides that, we love the place, the food, the margaritas and their service is always great."
1,"Great food as always, but even better service! I'll be honest, we have not always had the best service here, but keep coming back for the yummy tex-mex. Last night, Oct. 17, 2014, we went out for dinner & had the best service I have ever had. Ashley C. Never let my glass get empty & was just the right amount of attentive without being over bearing.  Awesome service! Good food."
1,"We came to Red White & Brew as a quite large group and they were very accommodating. I was a little hesitant to come here since I don't drink and it had brew in the name, so I didn't know if the food would be any good. Well I was wrong. I had the meatball calzone and it was amazing, probably the best I have had.  The complimentary garlic bread was awesome. I have heard the pizza is great but have not yet tried it. I will for sure be coming back ."
1,"Midwood, I must say you do make some pretty good BBQ. I came here for my first time for lunch with a friend who recommended it to me. Before this, I came in as a salesman and thought it would be a nice place to come back to check out what they can offer. Inside, its new and well and has a nice bar on the right when you walk in. You can have the choice of either dining inside or outside, we decided to sit outside for this meal.\n\nFor appetizers we ordered the jalapeno wrapped in bacon. Which was pretty good, I must say. It came with ranch and they pump it full of cheese, so the first bite in that cheese comes oozing out into your mouth. Keep in mind that it can be a little spicy for some people, but no worries that ranch comes rushing in and cools it off. (if not there's always beer to the rescue!)\n\nFor my lunch entree, I ordered the large plate of Chicken BBQ which comes with two sides (small comes with one) and for the sides I ordered BBQ Coleslaw (because I've never heard of it) and Mac n Cheese. \n\nFor the Chicken BBQ: It was pretty interesting, full of sauce lets just say. But I thought it was a little disappointing because the chicken was dry, but the juice that was added to it tried to make it taste less dry. They also gave me some sort of mustard BBQ sauce that was kind of interesting because it gave a little spin on normal mustard.\n\nThe Mac n Cheese. Wow. This one was cheesy at the same time not at all watery. It was just full of cheese. I think this was the one dish that convinced me to give them 4 stars instead of just 3. I think this is a very scrumptious side to go along with any BBQ dish. The BBQ Coleslaw wasn't too bad either, except that even though it's a BBQ Coleslaw I didn't really taste the BBQ that much. At the same time though, it wasn't like normal coleslaw. It was sort of like in between, like you know that it's coleslaw yet you don't know if it's normal or they added something to it.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed it. I recommend coming during lunches because it seemed like there wasn't that many people. If you do come here for dinner though, it looks like from the other reviews that it's constantly packed so make sure you come early! This restaurant I believe opened last year so, make sure to stop by and try out their dishes (especially the mac n cheese)."
1,"I was stoked to hear Hawthorne's was coming to the Robinson Farm shopping center. Where some of the other businesses in this little Rea Rd plaza are much more frequented, Hawthorne's has really found themselves a great spot in the South Charlotte hood. Taking over from a previous Italian place, these guys found a perfect location in Ballantyne. \n\nThe interior has great appeal. High ceilings, open seating, plenty of bar tables and stools, booths, and standard four-seaters. Love the L-shaped format, as it makes a central area for servers/expos to run food. No odd bottleneck near the restroom entrances.\n\nAnother brilliant aspect, if any of you know Hawthorne's on 7th and have experienced the droves of families with multiple children parading the entire restaurant, is the separate game room. Big windows so you can keep an eye on the little ones, a TV playing kids movies to keep them entertained and plenty of games. Great call. \n\nThe food, per usual Hawthorne's, is great. Tried the \""bottlecaps\"" or jalape\u00f1o poppers for the first time. No cheese on these bad boys. Just friend jalape\u00f1o slices. Brilliant! Now, they just need to score the jalape\u00f1o pale from Birdsong. Then we'll be on to something! \n\nThey have really become the great \""neighborhood pizza joint\"" in town. Had the Luau pizza, half sans protein, last night and it was great. Also, we sampled a pasta special reminiscent of a scampi that was divine as well. Fettuccine, chicken, gorgeous fresh basil, peppers, and satueed onions. Pretty heavy meal, so we had leftovers. Who doesn't love cold pizza in the morning? Also, any place with PBR on draught is a win in my book. \n\nHad the pleasure of meeting Chef and one of the owners during the meal. Both great guys. \n\nCan't wait to come back and sit on the patio. Caught wind that the patio will be heated for outdoor seating during the cold months. Winning. \n\nCheers!"
0,"Valentine's Day and what can be better than a wonderful night out with my beautiful wife!  We booked reservations at Fogo de Chao and were looking forward to a wonderful evening.  We arrive promptly for our reservation and were warmly greeted by a 20 minute wait standing in an overcrowded lobby.  We overheard the hostess tell another patron that Fogo was running behind because people were taking longer than expected to eat.  I guess they did not account for folks actually wanting to enjoy their meal and their conversation on Valentine's Day.  \n\nWe were taken to our table and our waiters greeted us with \""Man, I am tired, can't wait until by shift ends.\""   - Sorry for the inconvenience.  We will try not to ask too much of you. -  Well, I think he read my thoughts because we went to the salad bar and returned to find that we still did not have our drinks, including water, or forks.  We did a quick check to see in anyone else was eating with their hands as part of the cultural experience.  But, they had forks and water, so we waited.  And waited... Finally, we flagged down a meat chef who kindly gave use the equipment necessary to begin our meal.  \n\nThe food was average.  The steaks were great, but the lamb was gamey and the chicken was average and a bit dry.   The rolls were beautifully prepared and had an interesting texture.  \n\nWe were invited to try their dessert, but decided that we did not want to overstay our welcome.  So we politely asked for our check and waited.... We did pass the time watching the waiters flip through the bills from other customers evaluating their tips like the IRS agents checking tax returns.  \n\nTo be serious for a moment, for the price of this restaurant, we expected a more classic dining experience with a professional, attentive wait staff, etc. However, it may have just been a over overcrowded since it was Valentine's Day.   Yet, that is exactly why we picked this establishment in the first place...."
0,"There was no line at this wings truck when I rolled by, but they wait for your order before putting a single wing in the fryer apparently?? \""Everything is cooked-to-order\"" they said.\nYou would think that running a hot wings truck at a fair like this for years, they would have a slight clue that since their only menu items are wings, and they are called sin  city wings, that pretty much everyone orders wings. They should have had a couple wings going at all times, so it really made no sense.\n\nI sat there 30 minutes and watched them average maybe 1 order of wings every 5 minutes. It was beyond pathetic, and they screwed up my order and made me wait 30 minutes to watch their pathetic display of 3 men in a truck and 6 fryers that were outputting less than one wing per minute.\n\nIf you want to pay cash only and wait over 30 minutes for a dozen or ten wings go ahead. If you pay credit, be prepared for a possible mishap. I never even got my wings, and returned the order with my credit card but was still charged!\n\nIf you are hungry, go eat anywhere but here"
0,"I am not impressed. The pizza, garlic knots, meatballs zeppole were decent, but nothing to write home about. \n\nThe worst part was the spaghetti and meatballs dinner I ordered. I asked for sauce on the side, which they did. But they gave me a minuscule portion of spaghetti (not even enough for a child's portion IMO and it was hard and had obviously been sitting. There was literally more sauce than pasta. \n\nThe side salad with grilled chicken is $3 more than without, so I assumed they must give a decent sized piece of chicken with it. You know what they say when you assume, right? There was maybe half a cutlet's worth or pre-frozen, microwave grilled chicken (think McDonald's kind) on it. \n\nSo all in all, I paid almost $20 ($12 for the spaghetti and $7 for the salad) for what amounts to a child's portion of food (half of which was inedible). We got the food maybe 30 minutes before closing, so when I called to let them know I figured we could just work it out next time (we were happy with everything else) but the phone just rang and rang. We will definitely go somewhere else next time."
0,"You'll miss breakfast if you're up too late with a 100oz drink from Fat Tuesday. Still pricey, and very similar to all the other buffets."
0,"This place was horrible, well maybe just not that great.  I stayed there on the Friday before New Years Eve, when the rooms are quite expensive.  They put me in a room that was had not even been made up yet.  I called the front desk.  They asked me to come to the lobby again for new keys.  There was no room upgrade for the inconvenience.  The new room was not that great.  And they even put me in the remodeled wing of the hotel.  I would not feel safe walking around this area at night."
0,"Nothing too complex here. Everything tasted well, but there's definitely room for improvement. Meatloaf was cold, the manager did take care of it. Green beans, needed a minute more in the saut\u00e9 pan.. Fried chicken was good, the dark meat was moist, crisp skin, but the white meat was dry. Homemade potato chips was overly salted. Deviled prosciutto eggs, needed more than just prosciutto. No hostess to greet you. You have to find them. My Singapore sling was well made. My server was good, but I knew she was swamped. I guess a culinary dropout makes meatloaf, a graduate makes a terrine... Maybe it was a terrine, that's why it was cold...."
1,"Kate to the rescue! With only one day notice, Kate took my order of 25 cupcakes for my Birthday get together.  She suggested glittery rose shaped icing in different shades of pink on top of either chocolate, vanilla bean or s'mores cupcakes.  What a vision!  Cannot wait to pick them up tomorrow night."
1,"GREAT babies/kids clothing! Although a bit pricey, everything is cottony and i believe organic and comfy and comes in a ton of colors. The separates you can buy there like shirts, leggings, and jumpers are perfect for mismatching and creating tons of new looks. \n\nWhat is great about wild child is that the clothes are practical, whimsical, fun, and appropriate for children. Nothing has logos or dumb words or graphics on it, and most of the clothes are considered gender neutral."
0,"I had high hopes for Taste of India, after reading the reviews, but I was not impressed. The food did not taste fresh (I had pakoras and an eggplant dish) and the rice was definitely old and crisp from sitting in the bottom of the cooker. I asked for spicy and my dish was quite mild. We were there toward the end of the night and the staff seemed resentful of our presence. As much as I love Indian food, I'll probably give Taste of India one more chance sometime, earlier in the evening. I hope to report back with at least one additional star."
1,"Throwback Diner - good atmosphere, food, staff - had the 1/4 chicken BBQ dipped with Mac n cheese + homemade chips and 1/3 lb beef burger - all very tasty! Will go back again."
1,Great atmosphere. Great food. They have vegan menu. Ate the vegan pizza which was  amazingly tasty.
1,"This little gem is tucked away in the Four Queens Casino on Fremont Street in downtown Vegas. The Chicago-style deep dish is amazing....lots of sauce, sausage & pepperoni....holy crap it's awesome!\n\nThey also have a very delicious (but small) selection of microbrewed beers that are very good as well! I cannot believe that, in all the times I've been to Vegas (my wife and I go a few times a year and always stay downtown) that I only experienced this place for the first time last week (NYE 2010). Prices are reasonable, service is friendly, highly recommend!"
1,"This is exactly what Gilbert needs! Love this place. Love everything about it: location, service, food, vibe. It is really cute and has comfortable seating outside and inside. There is a grass area where you can bring a blanket and eat your food there. There is always a wait, but they take such great care of you. They brought us out some tasty olives while we sat around and sipped on bellinis. The bruschetta is amazing. Then I had the roast beef sandwich and Italian salad, which blew my mind. Sitting on a comfy cough, sippin on some beverages, and biting into some crispy bread loaded with salmon, figs, pesto, and sun dried tomatoes. Close to heaven as you can get on Earth."
0,"After having my worst experience with a hotel in Las Vegas, my only pleasure is to get to write this horrible review.\n\nI came here for a business trip for a conference in their conference center.  My bad experience started a couple months before my trip when I booked the rooms for my colleague and myself.  The hotel would not take a pre-authorized card.  This is something I do with EVERY hotel I stay at for business.  I do not get the company card for the actual trip so this is a must.  They let me know I can do a pre-payment.  Fine, done.\n\nOn the day I arrive, I go to check-in.  It's was pretty easy and fast but as I give them my name, they tell me they need a card for incidentals.  Fine, this is normal.  I give my bank card and the lady then informs me she is going to take out 400 dollars!!  Excuse me? What for?  For incidentals I'm informed and because my bank card is not a \""credit\"" card.   Again, this is something that has never happened to me at any other hotel in Vegas - or any I've gone on for business.  I argue that I'm not even going to be in my room and not going to order anything to the room or use the fridge.  She then lowers what she will take out to $200.  I'm still annoyed because even though I'm getting that credited back when I check out - it will take 3-5 business days to post to my bank account.  Strike two.\n\nThe next morning I take a shower before the conference and it's luke warm.  I deal with it but pretty annoyed. \n\nI then pick up our packages for the show at the Business Center - the lady says to me \""$10\"".  Excuse me? For what?  \""For holding the package.  We charge by ounce\""  How cheap are you Rio?  Looking to make a dollar off of me in ANY way?  What kind of service is this that you are providing for your guests?!  Especially since this conference is bringing you A LOT of money!  Strike 3\n\nLast day of the conference, I take a shower before my first morning meetings and the water is FREEZING!  Strike 4!!  Seriously what am I paying $160 a night for???!!\n\nOverall, this is my worst experience ever at a hotel in Vegas, and it's so far off the strip why would you even think of staying here??  160 dollars is definitely not worth it!  The place overwhelming smells like smoke, is horribly cheesy and loud, cold showers, mediocre rooms and so far off the strip.  You can find a MUCH better deal in Vegas.  Colleagues in the industry who also attended the conference stayed at Mandalay for $75 a night - much nicer than the Rio.\n\nDON'T STAY HERE!!!!!  Unless you want to waste $160 a night - plus where ever else they can get money from you!"
1,"This is an awesome place...step back in time with amazing decor, baseball memorabilia, and caring service.  This restaurant  was the first one built in Scottsdale (and a different location first), and the floors were handmade wood...before tongue and groove.  The menu includes its specialty of sirloin steak, but I had the liver and onions and my sister enjoyed a mouth-watering hand-pressed burger.  Stiff drinks.  Fruit cocktail on the menu.  \n\nWe expected Frank Sinatra to walk in the door at any minute.  The bar singer Steve York (on Friday and Saturday nights) reminds you of a cruise singer...fun...engaging the audience.  This was the place to be during spring training time, and owners Charlie (who died in 2002) and Gwen knew all the players by name and handed out a free steak dinner to the guys who hit homeruns. \n\nThis is a place not to be missed!!!"
0,"My boyfriend called a promoter and was able to get our group of ~15-16 people in for free to see Sebastian Ingrosso Dj for the Sunday dayclub. \n\n-Drinks are expensive\n-it took my bf forever to get drinks for us\n-Its crowded\n-the bathroom has long lines\n-there is barely any room to sit, let alone put your stuff anywhere; so you're basically wading in water the whole time. (there are lockers that you can pay to leave your stuff though)\n\nSo unless you get a table/cabana, it's not very comfortable. Don't get me wrong, the music was awesome and I had a lot of fun with my friends, but the layout needs work for us lay people who cant afford throwing around money for a table. \n\nWe were dancing/swimming near an area that these old grumpy mid 30 year olds kept complaining were \""THEIR SPOT\"".

1,"What a great bar with really good finger foods.   We went on a Friday night  for beers and food.  I am not a huge beer fan but enjoy some of them  I had a Honey beer which was quite good and very large.  My Husband had a Brown beer, which he enjoyed.  We ordered some finger foods to go with the beer.  We ordered the Humus & Pita, Fries, and Beef Tacos.  The Humus was really good, lots of sesame flavor, which we love, and the serving was very large.  The Fries were ok, I would not order them again,  but them I'm not a huge fries fan.  My Husband, who is kind of a Fries snob, didn't like them very much.  The Tacos,  which I agreed to because my Husband likes them, were outstanding.  These aren't the hard shell greasy ground beef type, the three of them are on a soft shells and are actual beef strips marinated in some type of seasonings  with sauteed onions, and came with sour cream, salsa and guacamole which was served in a small side dish.  OMG, I could have eaten a dozen of them.  We ate and finished our beers and got some more beers.  This time, I got the Raspberry flavored beer and my Husband got the Dreadnought.  My first beer was better but this was drinkable.  The service was prompt and pleasant, and the bill was $45.00.  Totally worth a visit."
0,"Gadzooks Enchiladas & Soup \n         \""Just wasn't for me\""\n\n\nGadzooks is a create-it-yourself restaurant with a hip and trendy vibe. Gadzooks offers enchiladas, tacos, chopped salads and house made tortilla soup. The staff at Gaszooks is accommodating, friendly, personable, and knowledgeable about the products they provide. \u00a0The atmosphere is stylish but very cramped. \n\nI guess I was really expecting more, considering all the positive reviews I read and this is why I feel terrible for saying the food at \u00a0Gadzooks was bland and poorly executed. On my first visit to Gadzooks I had the two enchiladas meal. First you select a bread. I choose corn tortillas, \u00a0Next it was time to select a meat. I \u00a0went with the braised short ribs. After you select your meat your ready to add the enchilada sauce. I choose the \""Christmas\"" red and green, \u00a0two distinct sauces. Then your creation is topped with cheese, and \u00a0there are a few cheeses to choose from. I tried the Chihuahua Cheese. The medium size deep dish is then placed into a brick oven to bake. I added a few extras like Uncle Rico's pico and scratch made crema. \n\nTo be honest the food just wasn't good. The enchiladas were bland and soupy. Even tho Gadzoooks offers numerous toppings, I think less is better. The enchiladas seem to be covered with as much cheese and sauce as possible and this took away form the flavor of the meat. \u00a0Gadzooks wasn't the worst food nor the best, just disappointing. \n\n\u00a0 \nHowever ending on a positive note I LOVED their chips."
0,"Aah, Old Country Buffet, one of the first buffets I ever went to growing up. As a matter of fact, this and the Superstition Springs one were the two I went to.\n\nAbout maybe 11 years ago, we went to the S. Springs location.  We went there probably once a month and enjoyed it each time.  Until one day, we noticed the rotisserie chicken wasn't cooked all the way.  All my mom did was ask the waiter to tell the cook that the chicken wasn't cooked all the way.  Then they got the manager and he scolded us saying \""Well, you guys are just trying to get a free meal\""  After a little big of an argument (mellow on my mom's side) we left.  Last time I ever been to one.. until a couple weeks ago.\n\nAnyways, enough about the past.  Went here for a lunch one day, just, you know, see if it changed at all.  Walked in the door and totally remember the winding entrance (be quiet, it's nostalgia for me).  Were greeted and seated right away.  I remember the big drink station in the middle.  There were a lot of tables of course, then I looked at the buffet.  \""Wheres all the food?\""  I know it was lunch time, but the buffet was way small.  I've been to dozens of buffet's since this place and this place is childs play compared to others.  \n\nThe quality of the food is pretty much the same since I last remembered, maybe a slight less.  Probably won't come here again though, there's other buffet's out there"
1,"Pizza was on point! Chewy crust, fresh mozzarella and delicious topping! Sausage & mushroom and vingole will not disappoint. Manager stopped by the table to personally thank us and check in which was a nice touch. Good atmosphere, a nice addition to the Arcadia neighborhood- I will be back!!"
0,"My wife thought of a great idea to grab some carb legs for my birthday so she found Finz. Upon arriving we knew it was an old Vinnie's which at times could be sketch. Upon entering you could tell this was not a normal restaurant because of the seating set up, not really a separation between the bar and the dinner tables.\nWe were greeted as we entered and led to a table of our choice. Waitress was great and was pretty attentive. The food was good, definitely worth the prices which are decent. I ordered the Crab Legs my wife got the Steam Pot, My Step Father got the Peel & Eat Shrimp and my mother got the Shrimp and Scallop Pasta. All dishes were great except the Shrimp and Scallops were a little over cooked but the Pasta sauce was great. \nNow the bad, shortly after arriving and enjoying our Spicy Honey Shrimp App (Not SO Honey) there was an altercation between the Lady working the bar and a So Called Patron that apparently spends 8K a year there, ha ha.  The young lady decided to curse loudly at the man and hit him with her purse as he tried to defend himself and get very loud. There were kids there and this was around 7:30 which is normal for a Friday night dinner. After the families cleared out and the night went on the patrons who were regulars began to conversate about the incident with major profanity laced statements. As a first timer I could not believe their was a manager there to handle the incident and take care of the language as folks were enjoying dinner. Better management is needed. \n\nI agree with other folks the food is good but the regulars are not so welcoming. Unfortunately you cannot pick your customers but customers can pick their place to eat. I suggest if you are a family stick to weekdays maybe but FINZ is not a Grill more of an bar with good food. \n\nI will say that our waitress did apologize for the actions of the bar tender  but other than that nothing was done to cater to the guest who were trying to enjoy dinner."
1,"Stopped by while in Pittsburgh for work, and while many items on the menu caught my eye, I couldn't get past the lamb and roasted chestnut shepherd's pie. In retrospect, a huge plate of meat and potatoes wasn't the ideal meal to order on a sweltering summer evening, particularly since the dish comes straight off the broiler to you and is guaranteed to raise the temperature of your table 20 degrees. While I can't say that the chestnut flavor was strong, the entire dish was well seasoned, hearty, and completely delicious. And for under $10, it's a lot of food for your dollar. I also appreciated the beer selection and thought the atmosphere was cozy.  Great place!"
0,We go here a lot based on convenience. Take out only. Their food is ok. Can be inconsistent. But they're down the street and good if you don't have time to make dinner.
1,"Our first time visiting the container park, my family (husband and 3 boys) and I stopped in for a treat. I believe we met 1 of the owners (Barry). He was awesome! He answered any questions we had and was very friendly. The candy is a little on the expensive side but we don't mind because we knew we were supporting a local business. Before we left he played a Jelly Belly game with us. There are multiple colors of jelly bellys but only 2 flavors per color. One good flavor or one disgusting flavor. You landed on white? Will you end up eating coconut or baby wipe flavor?  We enjoyed the game so much we bought 2.\n\nOne other thing is Barry seemed VERY open to suggestions on items to carry. We were trying to pick out a few things for our daughter who was in school at the time and I was talking to my husband about fake braces that I had seen at a magic store and how much our daughter would love some. Barry overheard us and explained that he was always looking for new and interesting items to carry. \n\nClean space, awesome customer service and good candy variety. We can't wait to visit The Sweet Spot again!"
0,"Diverse selection of push-cart dimsum but unfortunately the lack of flow meant that some of the dimsum sat on the carts too long.  On the day we were at Peter Wong, some of the flavors were not quite right.  The tasty pan-fried chive dumplings stood out and is probably the only thing we'd order again."
0,"The only thing worse than the service is the food. It had to be the first time the server had ever taken an order.  He couldn't figure out some simple requests so the manager came and apologized and then started criticizing the server to us. The manager forgot two things from our order, brought half the tables food out 10 minutes before the other half AND forgot one whole meal all together (there was four of us). The penne pasta's sauce was literally water, no joke. The hash browns were as white as the plate. The only good thing they did was comp us when we got up to walk out"
1,Boba and donuts..great combo. The donuts are awesome. Moist and delicious.
1,"I had a Color IQ and makeover appointment with Robbie a couple of days ago. The Color IQ was something I had been dying to do since my complexion can be baffling to match.  Unfortunately, the Color IQ actually did WORSE than I generally do on my own.  But no worries, Robbie went old-school and used his eyes to pick out a couple of colors, and found one that is the exact shade I expected the computer to come up with!\nMy previous experience with makeup artists was that they can be a little condescending, and not very warm or genuinely friendly.  Robbie (and everyone else I came in contact with) totally blew that out of the water.  He was really friendly and sweet, (and had breathtaking brows and shadow!) asked a lot of questions, made selections based on my answers, and was not pushy AT ALL about product purchase (disclaimer: Sephora does expect you to spend a certain amount, either $125 or $150 on products used during the makeover, but I believe the Color IQ is free).  He gave me a lot of different ideas and options, and I LOVED the look he gave me. The products themselves came from several different lines, and I liked that, too.  The skin care products he used on my face were a line I'd heard a lot about and was considering purchasing, so Robbie gave me a brief rundown on them and had another consultant come over and give me even more info while he gathered up my cosmetic purchases.  I cannot remember the skin care girl's name, but she put a generous sample in a little tub with a tag attached giving its name and instructions for use-very nice touch.\nI ended up asking Robbie to move in and do my makeup every day, but I do believe he gave me the tools and information to do it myself.  I did spend a lot of money, but this stuff all has purpose and won't end up in the back of a drawer.  Great experience!"
1,"In short: Awesomely nice inexpensive hotel with a shitty pool.\n\nIn long: We used priceline.com's name your own price, and got it for $60 on Thursday. In future if priceline won't hook it up, they offer a 10% off or so with AAA just fyi.\n\nWith a cheap hotel in mind I wasn't expecting much. And boy was I impressed (this is based on the checking in/out) and the rooms alone (aka I didn't really use the casino much but I did chill in one of the bars in the middle of the casino which was nice). \n\nThe room was SO SO nice. We got the Jim Carrey themed room so we had some paraphernalia from his movie in our room, so that set a pretty sweet mood. The beds were super big and super comfy. The room and bathroom were super spacey and super prestine, we felt like high rollers. There was also a 42inch or so flat screen tv with lots and lots of channels too, which was awesome. \n\nSo we went to the pool area and it SUCKED. It was this huggggggge area with terrible planning- the left and right most areas had decent sized, sort of boring pools (though the left one was closed) and then there was this HUGE area between the two just for tanning. I guess I understand a lot of people like to tan, but we all felt that it'd be much nicer if they flipped it and had a huge pool in the middle and tanning all around it. We were all pretty unimpressed. They played like top 40 on low volume in the background too. I guess I'd call it bland.\n\nBUT just in case someone really needs a pool or tanning area and you're staying at a shittier place or one without a pool or tanning area, they don't card you at all to get in and out.\n\nAll in all, a great, great experience- I'd definitely stay here from now on."
1,"Their food always tastes homemade and the omelets are fantastic.  I would definitely recommend the biscuits and gravy as well.\n\nI've read some comments on here about the service, but we have been there over a dozen times and never have had a bad experience. It does get really busy on the weekends but as long as you're patient and you don't go into there expecting McDonald's like speed, you shouldn't be let down."
0,"Looking for a general contractor that cannot get the job done? Then this should be your first choice. Start with promises that cannot be met.

Deadlines to his definition is when \""he\"" feels it can get done, more so when \""he\"" wants to get it done.  Your business suffers unimaginable loses waiting on completion. If things are not completed, then there is SOMEONE else to blame for that. No accountability for anything!!! Poor representation of a business owner."
0,"I hold the Duke status for this place, but am fully willing to relinquish it. Like many restaurants that start out so good and degrade into mediocrity, TE PUB has followed miserably. My primary complaint about the place is the attitude of the wait staff and hostesses. The snooty arrogance of this place does not turn me on. There are a couple of friendly bartenders but most of the wait staff seems annoyed at best. One hostess in particular might be the worst in town. \n\nLast time we went my friend ordered fries that tasted like they hadn't changed the oil in the fryer in a week. \n\nToo bad, I used to like this place it was my go to joint when clients were in town."
1,"I really like this place, but the prices are a little inflated. I used to come here a lot with my co-workers at lunch when I worked in the area, but not as often since I changed employers. I still want to come here because I love the habenero burger so, so much, but I'm a little iffy on spending $13 on a burger. I come occasionally when I'm not feeling cheap but I never have any regrets afterward. The drinks are also a little overpriced for how weak they make them. The fries are really, very good too and I really like the river running through the back patio. Gives your meal a great atmosphere. I also like to call ahead so I can pick it up and eat at home. The hostess and bartender are usually very personable and helpful. I would recommend giving it a try!"
1,"When we are in the mood for some North Indian style MEAT we head to Tandoori Times.\n\nI've eaten at both Tandoori Times locations and both are delicious. My only complaints are that some of the dishes are a little heavy on the oil but that can be typical for some Indian places - especially those that are more Pakistani in nature and they do not offer much of a vegetarian selection.\n\nWe taken family and friends to this restaurant, some of which have never had Indian food, with great success. The food is generic enough for the American palette but still delicious for those of us that huff spices in our spare time.\n\nI've yet to try their Chaat on the weekends but I'm dying to do so!"
0,"Food is good (not amazing or anything) but just like any other hole in the wall Thai place. This place became trendy and it totally worth going but you will leave thinking that was good but nothing special, then you may be robbed and possibly raped do to the neighborhood this place is in. The service is super slow, they seat way more tables then they can handle per server."
0,"I used to know a Canadian who would brag that this place had the best ribs.  So of course, when I made a trip up there from the States, I had to check it out.  As soon as I walked in, I noticed the pictures of all the celebrities, mostly hockey players, who visited over the years.  So I thought to myself, this place must be as good as advertised.  \n\nI ordered the Whole Hawg, which is a full rack of ribs.  All I can say is these are the worst ribs I have ever eaten.  What the hell is that diarrhea they glazed the ribs with?  I'll tell you what it was.  It was a low quality soy or teriyaki sauce mixed with honey.  The whole thing was a dark and sticky mess that tasted like really bad Chinese or Japanese food served at a cafeteria.  And if that wasn't bad enough, the meat was greasy.\n\nEverything is cooked on a gas-fired rotisserie, so I wouldn't really call this BBQ.  At least not the American standard for BBQ.  But if this is Canada's idea of BBQ, they can keep it.\n\nThe poulet was only a little better than the ribs, but not by much.  With such lousy food, I can't believe this place has been around for so long."
0,"We used to love this place until our rent keep going up. The leasing office people are hard to work with and the place actually start breaking down. And they never fix anything anymore at all. And heard a lot of bad experiences from the neighbors about people in the leasing office are  horrible and not very helpful. Well, we plan to move out anyway and will never recommend this place to anyone. I walk pass behind the G garage for months where's the mailbox is to pick up my mails and the huge puddle and very stink and also mosquitoes flying around on it, awful. Feel sorry for people that live in the unit near by."
0,"On a snowy night in late February we walked to this establishment.  We were seated right away, but then the long wait began.  There were 6 of us and we were not that hungry.  The reviews on this place were good in yelp, so we expected much more than we got.  We ordered 3 of the prix fix menu which the waiter said would be enough for us.  He said that he was not a waiter there, but filling in to help them out as they had scheduled a large party.  We waited about 40 minutes to get any food.  The portions were skimpy, and the quality of some of the dishes was ridiculous.  It took us several hours to get the food, and it was eaten quickly as we got hungry waiting.  Then we asked to take our desert to go, as we did not want to stay there any longer.  They refused to serve us our desert, which was included in our package.  When we asked them to adjust the bill for it, they refused.  I wanted to warn folks about this place as it was one of the worst dining experiences that each of the six of us had ever experienced.  reluctant to even give one star, except the system does not allow zero."
0,"I agree with previews posters who said the place is overpriced - expensive, tiny portions which do  not taste all that great. I do not mind paying a lot of money for great food but what they serve is not worth the $$ they charge for it at all.  I would not go back anyway but on top of it, I got food poisoning there. I threw up eight times several hours after eating there. My husband  tried to reported it to them. The restaurant was closed at the time when he called and they did not even bother to call back. Bad experience on every level, except the service was OK!"
1,"sandbar is an attractive place. i went there with a couple buddies to check out the happy hour. ive been here a couple times before but usually on a weekend and wasted and its pretty cool then.\n\nwe sat at the outside bar where the sand is. if i thought about it i wouldve brought sandals. im joking.\n\nhappy hour is good. 1/2 off apps and drinks, so roughly $2 domestic pints. \n\nwe mostly enjoyed the food we had. i got the carne asade fajitas. good stuff. \n\ncool bartender and plenty of girls to round out the atmosphere. \n\nsurprisingly i didnt get wings this time, but ill be back, and will update this review."
1,"I always go to Trina's the family that runs it works well together and they know how to hustle when it's busy. I could just sit in there all day. I got blue glitter tips today, but my faves are the pink hearts...!!!"
0,"Before I start, we got there around 4:00 pm after spending a long morning at the Grand Canyon - I had high expectations after seeing friends visit over the years.\n\nParking was challenging.\n\nThe hostess asked me if we were there for lunch or dinner ... lunch?  Really?  It's 4:30.  It was a party of 7 so we got sat in the dark saloon after walking through the shop.  There was a hand full of people inside.  Why so many cars?\n\nFound out there was a wedding that day and filled up the lot.  Not sure if that was the designated parking area for that - but, yeah ... events should have separate parking.\n\nFood was so-so.  Pies were fine.  Two kids, Five adults, 4 pies - $135.  I'm sad I spent over $20/person after tip when there are so many other great places to eat for less.\n\nThen, I found out the cafe on the other side of the restaurant had all these people there.  We were mostly Asian and I don't want to play the race card ... but it just felt that way.\n\nI won't be going back."
0,"This was quite possibly my worst dining experience since moving to Phoenix about six months ago.\n\nMy wife and I eat out quite frequently and had heard decent reviews about Spasso. We decided to visit the restaurant last night with another couple.\n\nThe food was overpriced and only average. We ordered their mozzarella plate that was served with soggy vegetables and 3 tiny pieces of cheese. For almost $15 I would have expected more. While the mozzarella was the highlight of our meal, imagine sharing 3 pieces of cheese amongst 4 people. This was the BIGGEST mozzarella plate that was offered on the menu.\n\nOur calamari appetizer was chewy and lukewarm at best. The pizzas were alright, nothing spectacular. Very much your run of the mill pizzeria.\n\nService is where this restaurant falls flat on its face. Their website, along with our waitress, speaks that the restaurant closes at 10pm.\n\nAt 9:15 we tried to order a bottle of wine and were told that we couldn't have the bottle because they were closing. The \""manager\"" turned the lights off in the bar and brought us our check.\n\nFor a restaurant as empty as this place was, I couldn't believe they would have turned down the chance to make an additional $40. Their manager knows his business way more than I do and maybe he's doing so well he simply didn't need our $40.\n\nThat being said, I've never been denied service in a restaurant and I've never been told so blatantly and rudely to leave.\n\nWe won't be back and I suggest you take your money elsewhere."
0,"So this rating is based on service and experience at my visit only as the food never came...  The place was not busy and we waited for about 30min for breakfast before deciding to walk out. We asked our server about 10 min before about our food and our response was 'yeah your food is coming...'  It seemed like a cute place at first but after sitting, I realized how filthy the place is. I've been here couple of times before but this place has definitely went down hill since my last visit. I yelped it after my visit and saw all the bad reviews. Not based on a food review but the only thing that's keeping this place going is the very limited breakfast omelette places in the area."
1,"AMAZING (fried) CATFISH, WTH???    I don't like fried food much, and I don't really like fried fish, like fish and chips - ugh, not my thing.  This is DIFFERENT, it was light and fluffy, delicious breaded coating that was crispy and had flavor, not greasy.  \""Juicy and melt in the mouth tender\"" as DinerGirl says, and LOVE THE HOT SAUCE, so glad my fellow Yelpers told me to use it!\n\nNice big patio out front with tables to watch the light rail zoom by, nice big parking lot out back.  \n\nWish Charlie and his wife (who are really NICE people, by the way) would relocate to the east side, as we almost never venture to their part of town, darn it!"
0,It's closed now. \n\nLos Favoritos took it's place.  A significant improvement.
1,My daughter stays here and lets face it i cannot afford any other daycare than here. Whats most important to me is the safety of my daughter. Yes she has come home with a scratch or a bump here and there but the staff will let me know how and why. My daughter knows all of the staff which leads me to believe that they all contribute in watching the little ones. It's not perfect but for the price this place is a great value.
1,"Wynn/Encore Appetizer Crawl: Part 1\n\nWhen you get to be my advanced age you don't do bar crawls. Instead you do appetizer crawls. It's easier on the system and takes far less recovery time. With the wife and a couple friends in tow, we decided to check out some of the Wynn/Encore restaurants. Bartolotta was our first stop.\n\nWe grabbed some seats at the bar, ordered some drinks and looked over the menu. We got two orders of the lasagnette con ragu di crostacei. It was recently featured on the Food Network as one of Bobby Flay's favorite appetizers. Now, I'm not a Flay fan, but the dish did sound delicious -- pasta, lobster, crab, shrimp, white wine and tomatoes. While it isn't one of the best dishes I've ever had, it was very good with large chunks of lobster and crab and a light, fresh profile overall.\n\nThey were nice enough the split the orders so we each had our own plate. The bartenders were friendly and accommodating and didn't mind that we only stuck around for a drink and one order. They did verify that the fish is flown in fresh daily from Italy -- and yes, that expense is passed on to you. If you're looking for cheap seafood go to Red Lobster."
1,"I love, love, love this place! It is beautiful- all outdoor seating on a lake in a residential neighborhood. Decent menu and AMAZING nachos- did I mention they have amazing NACHOS?!! Excellent service and friendly people all around.\n\n Anyway, if you are in the Tempe area, you must stop by for a cocktail and some grub- on the weekend nights they also have live music- WOOT!"
1,"I love wandering around Target. I'm not sure why it's so entertaining, but I love to just go and look at things (although somehow my cart always ends up with a bunch I stuff in it that I didn't plan on buying). There's almost always clearance items, especially in baby/toddler clothes and women's clothes. The other day I found 2T pants for my daughter for next winter for $1.50, which is a heck of a deal. I love finding deals like that! There's also usually lots of end caps with clearance items. And Target carries some Melissa and Doug toys, which are my favorite- er, my kids' favorite, I mean... \n\nThe store is always clean and fairly quiet. There's never a ton of people around, which I like. Once in a while there's a bit of a wait at the registers, but they're pretty good about calling up more cashiers when there's more than 2-3 people in a line."
1,"Our go-to restaurant, where the food and service are always excellent."
0,"I ate here because I was hungry and craving Chinese food. After a disgusting experience, I wish I never ate here in the first place. I wish you could rate in half stars but then again it wouldn't deserve that rating either.\n\nFirst off: There was only one waitress doing everything in the front of the house: taking orders. answering phones, cleaning off tables, refilling drinks and taking orders to the tables. And the service was horrendous. I waited at least five minutes before she took my drink order, and another ten minutes for her to take my food order. If you wanted a refill, you literally had to flag her down and tell her.\n\nSecond: The food was mediocre. I'd choose Panda Express over this place. The food was bland, the rice was crunchy and so was the \""egg flower\"" soup. I also ordered the Crab Rangoon, which were basically just filled with cream cheese, no crab taste whatsoever. They were still cold, fresh out of the fryer, and came with no dipping sauce.\n\nThird: This place is a health department nightmare! The kitchen staff wasn't wearing anything to be sanitary. No hairnets or aprons. I have no clue if they were sanitary when it came to handling raw food. Two out of the three glasses at my table were filthy. The first glass had food particles floating at the top. The second was dirty around the rim. The glass I was drinking out of was \""clean\"" but the outside of the glass felt gritty, and glassware isn't supposed to feel like that. I noticed the waitress cleaning off one table. She used water from a used glass to wipe the table down. After a man had been drinking from it during his meal. She pours a little bit of water out onto the table and proceeds to wipe up whatever mess was on it. After seeing that, I lost my appetite.\n\nFourth: There were no free refills. From a place charging nearly $3.00 for a soft drink, I'd like to see free refills, but this place charged $.75 per refill. But you could buy soda from a 24 oz. bottle, which costs $2. I noticed on the drive home that the soda bottle I purchased was expired almost three months ago.\n\nAll in all, this place was disgusting! The service was terrible, the food was terrible and the cleanliness of the place (or lack there of) was horrendous. I would never go back here. And avoid the lunch rush, because this is when it happened to me and I don't want anyone getting sick of this joints lack of cleanliness."
1,Love eating sushi here. I come buy on lunch break or for dinner with my family and dont have any complaints. their happy hour is great and their service is good too.
1,We love this place. Away from the smoky casinos. Clean room. Clean bed. Great breakfast. Enjoyable pool. Thank you Roddell for your help in securing 2 rooms for my family of 6!  Can't wait to return .
1,"Oh yeah!  This competes with Wynn for best buffet on the strip.  Came in for lunch.  Their asian selection is surprisingly very well done!  They have cool fruit juices, different seafoods, fresh meats, tacos, a great dessert bar (they even have gummy bears in a jar that you can take away).  An overall really really well done place.  Service here is also up there.  Even the guy cutting the roast beef had this big smile on his face and is so happy to give you a slice!  Bacchanal if you're reading this, you should give him a raise (he's a black dude - yeah that's pretty vague I know)!  I would definitely come back!  Oh, and this is better than the Wicked Spoon."
1,"In honor of receiving a 4-star award recently, Habitat chose to offer a $4 special on its burger at lunch (regularly $12).  With that offer, how could I say no - an opportunity to try one of the hot-list new dineries downtown?  So my coworker GH and I braved the bitter cold for a chance at nirvana.\n\nEnvironment:  very mod. Loved the color scheme - very soothing blues and browns.  Open dining room.  Dishes are very cool (white but not your typical plates) - and the salt and pepper are so unique, it was tempting to slip them into the pocket (no, I didn't take them, Chef, but I REALLY liked them - that was the first thing GH noticed on the table).  The water pitcher was even better - but that would never have fit into a pocket.....The commmitment to green manifests itself in everything from the placemats to the lighting - despite the grey winter day, the room takes advantage of all of the natural light available with the glass curtain walls.  Pittsburgh is not known for having an overabundance of sophisticated cosmopolitan dining establishments.  Habitat made me feel like I was in Frisco or NYC.  Contemporary, not cookie cutter mold, and not at all stuffy.\n\nVery quiet restaurant which means it is conducive to talking without the next table eavesdropping.  That alone makes this is a unique restaurant these days - I get weary of trying to talk over the music and hear about the next table's most recent fling or surgery.\n\nWait staff:  very good.  Rajee was our waiter.  Attentive, but not overbearing.  Service was quite fast - when I remarked to the server that our lunch came quickly, the response was \""we recognize that most folks don't have a long time for lunch so we try to serve you quickly\"".  I liked that.  We lingered way too long chatting after our lunch was consumed and, yes, we were still back in the office within the allotted hour.  I have a hard time doing that with any restaurant downtown.\n\nNow on to the food. I came for a burger. I wanted that burger.  But I looked at the menu and found a dozen other things I wanted more.  But I went for the burger (so this is an indication that I will be back).\n\nThe burger was good. I am not going to say it was the best I have ever had, but it was good.  It is served on a wonderful egg bun with nice thick ripe tomato, a slice of onion, lettuce, and a crispy dill pickle slice.   And the burger is a nice size - with all the fixings, it was a handful.  GH could handle it, I cut mine in half so as to not look like the ravenous carnivore that I am.  The meat was rare as I requested - but here is where it doesn't yet earn it's fifth star.  It wasn't messy.  I understand that a well-done burger will never drip juice - after all, you don't expect shoe leather to be juicy, why would you expect a well-done burger to be any different.  But a rare burger should leave some juices running down your fingers or chin (ok, it's a nice restaurant, maybe the chin thing would be too much).  But there was no juice which kind of was odd to me. The meat seemed to be chopped more than ground - which was not a bad thing, a little different but not bad.  It was not dried out or overcooked, it was just not juicy.\n\nThe burger came with a white cheddar slice melted on top.  And the flavor was kind of lost on the burger.  Now, it was not a large thick slice of Cheddar (after all, the sandwich is a loss leader) so maybe a thicker slice would hold up to the flavor.\n\nAgain, the same with the bacon.  I knew it was there but didn't get a really good taste of it.  Again, I am willing to consider that because of the low price, perhaps the bacon was quite thin and lost on the sandwich.\n\nFor sides, GH chose the obligatory fries which came in a cone and seemed to be quite good (when a coworker doesn't offer to share a fry, I figure they must be good).  I chose the butternut squash soup which is on the menu daily.  That soup alone brought the 3-star lunch up to a 4-star lunch.  It is not a large side serving of soup - maybe 1/2 a cup at most.  But it was a tasty soup, just the right thickness, lightly seasoned.  It came in this adorable little cup/bowl - which I wanted to lick clean then stick in the pocket behind the salt and pepper shakers and the frog pitcher.  I would come back for the soup alone - and one more chance at those salt and pepper shakers.... \n\nSo I am holding at 4 stars.  I will return - I will need to try that burger again to decide if it deserves a better rating or not.  And that naan pizza with ricotta and hummus is just calling my name...."
0,"Horrible experience!!! We went in around 11pm, when they were only serving their late night menu. We were told to seat ourselves, so we headed to a table right in the middle of the restaurant, next to, two other full tables.\n\nWe waited 15 minutes, no one came to our table, we watched 3 other servers walk by. After having to go ask someone up front to get our server, finally our server came by and got our order.. with no apology for the wait.\n\nWe ordered a burger and wings. Our burger came out wrong. Our server never came back to check on us.. so we pushed the burger to the edge of the table. Finally another 20 minutes later, he came by and asked how things were..\n\nAfter we told him everything that we were mad about, he never apologized or asked if he could do anything to fix it. Just said he would comp our bill, and walked away!!!"
0,"The car was a Prius by Toyota...One of those electrical / mechanical hybrids that require a NASA Certification License to operate!  I left the car there to have it oil & lubed, then a wash.  I was told it would be about approximately an hour or so before it would be ready.  So off I went to do some errands in the vicinity.  When I got back, I found that the car wash left the door open and that the vehicle wouldn't start...To my surprise all power was dead and it didn't have the power to turn on a flashlight!  It took a friend of mine to arrive with a pair of jumper cables and some patience as we had to slowly re-charge the battery and for the electronics on board to realize the charge.  After about an extra hours delay, I was able to re-start the car and drive off.  The car wash waived its' charges, but I was still a bit torqued of the situation because of the incompetence of the staff about the new hybrid automobiles(they shouldn't accept vehicles they are unfamiliar with!). .----I give them two stars for cleaning my tires and for draining my batteries."
1,"The hubby and I stayed at the Trump on our mini-honeymoon for 3 nights in October 2009, and we absolutely LOVED it.  I loved it so much I want to BUY one of the units.  (Didn't I hear one of the towers is comprised of units for sale?!)\n\nTrying to save cash, we opted for a city view studio. $120/night with a $50 spa credit.  The spa credit was supposed to be for one night only, but I flirted with the guy at the desk and he credited us twice!!  (It's cool, the hub's OK with it... he's a cheapskate.  Anything to save a couple $$.)  Oh, AND we got complimentary late check-out til 4pm.\n\nThe bed, amazing.  Not too soft, not too firm.  But that's objective.\n\nThe bathroom: INCREDIBLE.  Marble, floor to ceiling.  14\"" TV screen seamlessly embedded in the GIANT mirror.  Huge spa tub with 3 jet settings. (Which somehow, when you fill it, turns the water blue-ish...nice touch.)  There are separate toilet & shower 'stalls' with floor-to-ceiling glass doors, too. LOVE THIS BATHROOM.  Did I mention it's just a smidge larger than MY BEDROOM at home?!?!\n\nCustomer service in the lobby was mediocre, except for my exceptional desk service ;)   Valet and bell service was friendly.  Pool service was GREAT.  Those pool girls work hard taking orders, mingling with the grey-chest-haired, uber fried (I mean, tanned) creepers, and serving up all the refreshing drinks and yummy food... all in bikini tops and Juicy pants!  \n\nSpeaking of the pool, it's a bummer that it's so small.  And just watch out for the reflective glare of the gold windows... it's like a second sun!!\n\nAbout the location... it's directly across from the Wynn, and for 26-year old normal, healthy young adults, the walk from the front door to the Strip was only 3 minutes.  During the daytime, you could even take a shortcut through Nordstrom and cut another minute off (or, if you're like me, add 30 minutes to the walk by shopping......)\n\nAnyway - I LOVE Vegas and next time I go with the hubster, we will definitely return to the Trump!!"
0,"Now I have written some reviews about crappy places in the past but this might be hands down the absolute worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant in my entire life. Now this is incredibly gross so if you cant handle it don't read on. I went to loco patron for lunch like a year ago maybe things have changed. I ordered nothing special from the menu, all in all I would have given it like 2 and a half/ three stars. That is until a giant fucking cockroach crawled out of my food. Needless to say I am traumatized and will not go back there. To be honest I wasn't an asshole about it to the staff in fact I didn't say anything I just got the check and got the hell out of there. Now I have had bad experiences at places before, you know the old \""hair that is obviously not mine in my food\"" routine. You know what eventually I am hungry enough that I can forgive that one for the right circumstances, but I will never forgive loco patron for what happened to me. Well don't tell my psychiatrist that she says forgiveness is healthy or some shit like that."
0,"Just mediocre. My husband ordered the sunrise sandwich and he couldn't finish it since it was SO salty. The issue for me is that I ordered the \""mixed berry\"" yogurt parfait with granola. What a joke. No berries at all , just some fruit drizzle in the yogurt..barely any granola. Also ordered the turkey sausage too--very salty and it was spicy which the menu should have stated it was spicy. Not that good. We won't be back as there are too many other choices for breakfast and that are fresher and better prepared."

0,"I stayed here for NYE last night, and the hotel had come up with the most ridiculous strategy for dealing with partygoers. We were required to wear wristbands as hotel guests, and no one without a wristband was allowed into the hotel after 11pm on New Years or the few nights previous. The reasoning was that there were so many underagers staying at the hotel, but my friends and I were not impressed. Additionally, this policy was not announced on the website. As young professionals trying to have a good time, this hotel made us feel as though we were spending the night in a uiversity residence rather than a hotel. Very unpleasant."
0,"One star for food and one for their awesome bartender Emmanuel who redeemed the offensive service I got here. I've came here twice and both times Emmanuel was working the bar-so friendly and personable! He's just an all around nice guy, likes to make sure everyone's having a good time. If I could've taken the tip back from our waiter and given it to him, I would've. He gave us more service in the 8 minutes we were at the bar than our \""waiter\"" did in the 45 minutes we were at our table. \n\nI get it, not everyone likes their job every day. I don't like my job every single day! But when dealing with customers you pretend to like your job and don't make them feel like their presence is a burden. Our waiter didn't get that memo and his inattentiveness bordered on neglect. He came to our table three times, once to take our drink orders, food orders and then to bring the check. The way he asked if we wanted the check basically said \""I want you to leave now.\"" The busser came by more often than he did to see if we needed anything. \n\nThis place isn't worth the time if you're coming from out of your way. If you choose to go for the simple fact that yard house is the cluster that it usually is, sit at the bar!"
1,"Ok... This is different... Fun different.  A pretty big place when compared to other ramen places one could try in china town.  Front room seems to be the only place used for lunch time, but the back room looks great. Not to say that the front room was bad...just a little bright and cold for my taste.  Ooo speaking of taste... Check in and get the pork dumplings... Holy wow..easily the best we've had here in Vegas.  \n\n\nI will be back... And really I can't wait"
1,"Spending a great deal of time in the Southside of Pittsburgh (still not sure if that's a good or a bad thing) I was really excited about Carson Street's new addition. The last time I had Asian food in the Southside it was at a shady place that looked more like a Laundromat than a restaurant and the food tasted a lot like gasoline. The interior of this place is beautiful. High ceilings, large windows in the front (both times I've been there they've been wide open and inviting in the fresh air), and a great color palette. I've heard though that on the weekends in the evening the open windows sometimes invite in not only fresh air, but also some solicitation from the roaming homeless and drunks either asking for money or doling out insults or sexual harassment to the restaurants customers.  \n\nI've been in twice now and both times I've chosen items off of the lunch/dinner menus as they were quick and clear in what was included. The staff was quick and friendly, I even had a chance to speak to the owner at length about future plans to better and expand his business. While it does have that slight air of a new business just getting off the ground, it's not at all reflected in the food options. I definitely recommend this as an option when you're looking for a break from the usual bar food found on Carson Street."
0,Came in and really liked the decor. Decorated very festive. Chips were better than the salsa which was pretty runny. The guacamole was bland. My husband and I both ordered burritos. They were just ok. Nothing too spectacular and mine wasn't that hot. I did like their rice which was probably the best thing I had there. Server was friendly but seemed kinda lost and forgetful which was weird since we were like only the third table there. Probably won't be back to try again for you don't really get your moneys worth.
0,I'm from Ohio and I had a dodge pickup I rented from dollar rent a car and we we\nnt here to get gas after going to lake mead heading back to MGM grand and so we pulled into this place and went to a pump and I got out and got my chevron credit card out and started to insert my card till I seen a sign all payments must be made with cashier and so I went inside and told the cashier I need gas on pump 5 and she say ok and she said its ready and come back for a reciept and so I went back outside and I picked up the regular gas pump nozzle and it wouldn't pump no gas and so I went back and she said she activated pump 5 supreme and I said no I only wanted regular and she said oh you have to get the pump number on top of the regular pump and so I said well that's a little odd and wield and she states its just because we have older pumps and I said I'll just go down the street to a different station and told her to cancel my transaction.\n\n\n\nBEWARE THEY HAVE 1980's GAS PUMPS THAT DOES NOT HAVE CREDIT CARD MACHINES.
1,"Love this place!  My little chi, Moe, has been going there for the past month or so and it's been wonderful.  I love that when I call to schedule him for day camp or boarding they immediately know which dog he is and express their excitement that he'll be coming.  Moe has some attachment issues and likes to be near people constantly and they're fine with that.  In fact, they even seem to love it rather than being annoyed by it.  I love that they do the initial temperament test to make sure he'll do well there and that they have webcams running 24/7 that I can view on my phone.  The fact that he can run free and play (or climb in a lap!) all day is great!  I also really like that he's with dogs of all sizes and not separated into groups based on size like so many other facilities.  The report cards that are sent promptly at the end of each day and the pics on Facebook are all extra perks offered at Villa La Paws that make the experience of trusting them with your dog even easier."
1,"This was my first exposure to New Mexico cuisine.  I was really impressed.  \n\nI had the New Mexico sausages for an app and the Carne Adovada roasted pork shoulder in red chile sauce.  Both were really, really good.  Complex spicing and good heat level, tastey but not over burning.  This was both a unique and delicious experience.  And a learning experience too.  I'd go back in a second.\n\nThe service was good.  Both the hostess and waitress were stunningly good looking in a \""recently graduated from ASU\"" sort of way."
1,"One day I just got off the lite rail and we walking around Phoenix and found this spot. I ordered up an ice cold beer and looked over the menu and order up the Santa Fe sandwich - Warm roast beef, chipote mayo, green chili & swiss served on an onion challah roll. I ended up splitting it with my friend they were cool and served it to us on different plates with the sides as well. The meal was really good friendly staff and just a fun place to chill and have a good meal and a beer."
0,Not too keen on this place. Pricing is way too high considering the quality of the material used to make the clothes. The jeans especially!
0,"Great service, decent price, small portions...\n\nI ordered hummus, pesto and veggies on flatbread, it was tasty, but I had garlic breath for the rest of the day afterward.  Passable for a fast and inexpensive lunch, but not something I would seek out."
0,"I struggle with this place so much.  Several times I've stopped by for something to eat and they would be closed during advertised hours, staff meeting or something else going on.  Well I got in last night and had a cup of chili and a cookie for a snack on my way to an appointment.  The staff was incredible in a good way, very happy and professional.  I was impressed.  The food, not so much.  The cookie looked over cooked and was okay, the chocolate was pretty gooey, even though the cookie didn't see so fresh.  Typically chili is more expensive than soup, which was true here and I wasn't so impressed.  It was too hot so I burned the roof of my mouth and it seemed to lack flavor.  I'd go if a friend suggested it, but I wouldn't be the one making the suggestion."
0,"I wouldn't be so harsh on my review if this place wasn't a four star restaurant with a famous award winning chef. I expected a lot and was shocked at what was lacking.  First, the restaurant had no daily specials.  How does a restaurant of this caliber not have daily special entrees?? No fresh ingredients that was flown in for that week? No special entree that the Chef has created just for that day? Not a single special?? \n\nSecond, my friend had a steak and it was tough as hell.  TOUGH.  My jaw hurt eating it.  It wasn't overcooked, it was literally the quality of the meat, or perhaps they didn't know to rest the meat afterwards. Whatever it was, the steak was horrible and a fifty dollar steak should never be like that. What a disappointment.\n\nThird, my mussels were not fresh.  Unacceptable.  \n\nIt wasn't all bad, the duck pate and the braised ribs got rave reviews, but other than that and the service, the food itself was disappointing. I refuse to believe that the chef has been anywhere near the restaurant in recent months. If he was, someone of his background would never serve meat of that quality."
1,They were extremely patient with my very shy Havanese who i adopted and was terrified.  We are working together so that he feels more and more comfortable.  They did a lovely job on my dogs.
1,"Wow.  \n\nI was surprised to see the one star reviews for this place, but now that I see it's a young barely literate punk and someone who thinks sarcasm is a bad thing, well, it makes sense now.  \n\nThis store has a great selection of cd's, I've bought several used discs here and never had a problem with any of them.  I like how it's organized, I like the people, I love the late hours."
0,"Terrible, tasteless food\nChicken Asiago sandwich was bland, dry, tasteless.\nChocolate ice cream cup melted\nFrench fries over salted and cold"
1,"I find this place quite interesting since it's not the typical, bousie club/lounge you would find on the strip. And interesting I enjoy; bousie not so much. \n\nGold Diggers is somewhat hidden at the Gold Nugget. You have to go up the stairs to find it. First off, the times I've been to Gold Diggers, the bouncers AREN'T dicks or are minimal dicks and appear to lack egos. This is few and rare in the Valley. Second, this is the most diverse crowd you will get a chance to interact with. The people that come here can be bousie (not as much as on the strip though), can be very modest, come from all different cultural backgrounds as well as different shapes/ages/sexual orientation etc.! I think this is awesome considering I'm all for diversity :). Third, what makes this place even more interesting is the music they play. Music is from a wide range of decades and genres that include the 70's and even country. \n\nI like Gold diggers because drinks are cheap compared to other places, (I believe I paid 6-8 bucks for a jack and coke), the bartenders and cocktail servers are pretty yet have minimal/lack pretentiousness, the bathroom design and interior is pretty impressive for this kind of place and the patio overlooking freemont st. is pretty cool. \n\nIt's too bad that there aren't many places like this in Vegas..."
1,"My first time venturing into Ethiopian food.  I have a co-worker from Senegal and we have committed to trying all kinds of fare!  We arrived here after googling (so sad) but fun, late one Sunday night.  Passed it twice but finally found it tucked away.  The service was immediate and there were about 3 other tables of patron there at this late hour of the evening (maybe 10ish).  It is very dimly lit so if you dont' know anything about ths food move to a nicely lit table.  The prices were very fair.  Beers and wines available.  The food was fantastic.  The big plate that we shared was fun and different than anything I've experienced before.  I watched others who seemed familiar and my Senegalese friend also knew that you can eat with your hands.  What fun!  We ordered more and we will both definitely be back!"
1,"I lived in Queen Creek for about 9 months and discovered the QCOM then.  Today my boyfriend and I made the drive there again to enjoy a meal.  \n\nThe food was just a delicious as ever.  I had the del Piero Eggs Benedict, which I always have even though each time we go there I swear I'm going to try something new.  Yet I find myself ordering this because I know how good it will be.  Everything is so fresh and delicious I can't resist.  \n\nMy boyfriend had the Kalamata sandwich and he thoroughly enjoyed it.  I sampled it and there was a tang to the sandwich I didn't like but that's just me.  He also ordered a cup of one of the soups of the day, which was a creamy red pepper and was wonderful.  It came with a piece of fresh baked bread and I decided to go grab some samples of the various olive oils to dip it in.  That was an inspiration I'm glad I had!  It was a great way to try the oils without having to sip them straight, which is never my favorite.  \n\nThe only reason I don't give QCOM five stars is that the layout of the restaurant makes it difficult to get to the counter to order and to the drink station when it's crowded, as it usually is.  If I didn't know how good the food is, I would probably walk out seeing how difficult it is to negotiate your way through the crowd.  \n\nOh, I also think they need to have real silverware instead of plastic stuff.  Eating the eggs benedict is a challenge with the fork bending!  Still it's so yummy I'm willing to take that challenge."
0,"Customer service is bar none, once you actually get seen. The girl that helped me bent over backwards to ensure I was happy, and I would have been...\n\nIf I hadn't been waiting for over 3 hours.\n\nWith no bathroom.\n\nAnd nothing to do.\n\nMake sure your battery is charged or you bring a book so you have something to do. This is my second time here (had to wait 2 weeks for my backordered phone). I'm already into the first hour of waiting to be seen. There were 2 people in front of me. There are still 2 people in front of me. Lord knows how long they've been waiting.\n\nIf you speak Spanish, you get seen much quicker.\n\nIt's sad that, similar to a doctor's visit, I have to schedule my day around a visit to the Sprint store. At least the doctor's has magazines. And bathrooms."
1,"My husband and I have been to Grimaldi's about 10 times, and the pizza is great every time!  The crust is crispy on the outside with just a bit of softness on the inside.  It is thin but not cracker-thin.  The coal oven giveS the pizza a nice smoky flavor.  The service is also friendly and expedient.  \n\nWe have placed take-out orders a few times, and the order is always ready when they say it will be.  The employees are always courteous when taking my order on the phone.  The service is so good, I made sure to tell the manager the last time I was there.  He was also very gracious.  He makes the rounds every time I am there to talk to all the patrons.  I WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"
0,"I decided to give this place another couple of tries and again was sadly disappointed each time. The only thing that gives it a two stars is that it is only 7 dollars and close to my house which is convenient when I need a quick touch up. \n\nThere was one Indian woman who was fabulous but I have yet to see her again and did not catch her name.\n\nJackie has done my eyebrows a couple of times now and though she is one of the faster ones, she is not pleasant nor does she thread well. She more pulls off the hairs rather than pulls them out. When they are pulled off at the surface like that, your eyebrows require a touch up sooner which I don't think anyone wants. \n\nGreat for touch ups but I would not recommend getting your eyebrows shaped here."
0,"There are 3 distinct seating areas here - terrace, dining, and bar.  I chose the bar which turned out to be a mistake.  The owner (I assume) was holding court there with his associates and regulars.  Service was a bit of an afterthought under the circumstances.  I can't get past the feeling that it's unprofessional for a restaurant owner to use the business as a personal social venue.  There weren't many customers at 10am on a weekday, so perhaps others share my view.\n\nBlueberry corn pancakes should have been really good but they were nothing special.  I couldn't detect the cornmeal.  They charged me $2 for extra blueberries and I didn't think the pancakes reflected the addition at all.  \n\nBest thing was the grilled chili-cheddar cornbread served with habanero jelly.  Home fries are made fresh - not from frozen.  They were good.  \n\nI expected so much more from this place which does have potential, but I won't go back."
1,"i love Maxim. from the general mood of the place down to the random Christmas decorations that are never put away, it reminds me of a lot of the Vietnamese restaurants scattered throughout Little Saigon in Southern California, where the owners are originally from. some holidays, they'll take random trips back to visit, so don't be surprised if you roll up and find a handwritten sign saying that they are closed for a few days. the service is always great though, even when lunchtime diners pack the place. \n\ni've been here lots of times but only ever get one dish - the mi (egg noodle soup) but ordered dry style so that the broth comes in a separate bowl. it's something i ate a lot in CA, but have trouble finding in Phoenix. it's not quite what i'm used to, but comes pretty damn close. if you like mi but have never tried it this way, definitely give it a go! \n\nthere are just a few things to watch out for. it's in a small strip mall so you might miss it if you blink. the parking lot can get a bit crowded and making a left turn into the lot is tricky. and for all the Thai tea drinkers out there, we found out they don't sweeten it with coconut here. other than those tiny details, maxim is an awesome place to get a good, inexpensive meal."
0,"Not my favorite strip club by a long shot.  It's too crowded; there are too many chairs for this tiny club.  Seriously, the girls can't even do a proper lap dance without kicking some poor schmuck in the head with her big hooker shoes.\n\nAnd, the few times that I have been here I have been bombarded by dancers.  I know that some might not think this is a bad thing, but before you even get a chance to fight your way to a seat and settle in to your tiny little section, 10 girls have already asked you if you want a dance."
1,Love that place! good memories
0,"We had high hopes for this place, since we live in the neighborhood and we love to patronize local businesses in South Scottsdale. I was more than thrilled when a coupon on Living Social popped up. I read the reviews on Yelp and given that they said 4 stars and a lot of positives, we were even more excited to try it.\n\nUpon approach, you could smell the burning grease from outside. The restaurant itself, although lacking a bit in atmosphere, was clean, despite the grease smell.\nThe host, which later we found out was the manager, said \""sorry, we are having a bit of an air conditioning problem.\"" It was warm in there, especially by the kitchen, so he seated us in the back, which was a little warm, but not terrible.\n\nFirst the drinks. I ordered an Arnold Palmer, (1/2 lemonade & 1/2 ice tea). It was so sour, that even with a package of sugar I couldn't drink it. I LOVE tart drinks too. This was as if I was drinking lemon juice out of the plastic lemons you buy at the store. When I asked for them to re-mix it, the 2 servers said, \""yeah we've had people sending it back.\"" They were both very nice, and one of them re-mixed me another, and it was still extremely sour. She was very kind and brought me a plain iced tea, which was fine. \n\nWe were excited that this place had a lot of vegetarian friendly fare. My husband ordered a Vegan Chile with pita slices. Not so good. I tried it too. He is not by any means a picky eater, and neither am I. However, this was very pasty, dry, and tasted like tomato paste. The pita bread was hard as a rock, and stale. We also ordered spring rolls as an appetizer. They were okay in taste, but the outside were over fried and had a scorched flavor. We ate them, but they weren't great.\n\nAs for my food. I had a Turkey Burger and polenta fries. Sounds interesting right? Well the polenta fries were over fried, just like the Spring Rolls. My turkey burger was well done on the outside, but still raw on the inside. The manager came over and we told him about our food and the lemonade. He was very nice too, and even said he had been hearing complaints about the lemonade. So if this was the case I'm not sure why they didn't address it earlier. He took my food, and I asked if I could have just the regular fries when they re-did my plate. They were accommodating. I got the new Turkey Burger, which was pretty well done on the outside, almost charred, and just seemed dry. The bun tasted like it was several days old. Very stale. They forgot my garnishes, and brought them later when I asked. The regular fries were better, but they were still over-fried.\n\nMy husband and I have both worked in restaurants and we believe their grease was too old and too hot. We told both the waiter and the manager, about the sub-par food, but we complimented them on the friendliness of the staff.  They took our living social coupon, even though honestly, I feel they should have accommodated us a little more. But oh well. I won't be back. It is too bad because we live in this neighborhood and love to keep our dollars in it.  I am honestly surprised by the good reviews I see below, because this certainly was not our experience."
0,"After searching online for good slice of pizza, we found good reviews for this supposed gem. Not worth our time or effort. I'm always up to try new pizza, especially a thin crust pizza. Sbarros pizza slices have more flavor than this. Couldn't see, much less taste any kind of sauce, and while the crust was good, the cheese was nothing special. Very greasy too. At $4.50 a slice served on paper plates, I expected to be wowed. Not even the help serving were cordial, kind, or even gracious. I've been treated better at Sbarros and paid much less. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. There is barely a place to sit, unless you want to perch yourself on a makeshift shelf and unmatched bar stools."
1,"Finding somewhere a) with free seats b) indoors and c) reasonably priced, for food on a Saturday night during the Fringe is no mean feat. And the longer you ramble around George Square, the hungrier you get. Thank goodness, then, that we found Ushers of Edinburgh. \n\nHaving popped up (unbeknown to me) over summer, right next to the Pear Tree and the Blind Poet, this wee bar-come-restaurant is pretty cool. The menu is quite eclectic, ranging from smaller 'bar food snacks' to more substantial meals.\n\n I settled for a salted beef and cream cheese bagel whilst my companion ordered the smoked salmon with soda bread. The burgers that were going past our table did look mighty fine, so I could easily be tempted back to try more.\n\nThe portion sizes were perfect for our dampened appetites (shouldn't have opted for the pre-show sandwiches).  My bagel was really tasty, if a little heavy on the cream cheese for my liking. I'm not a massive fan of smoked salmon so can't personally testify for that, but apparently it was pretty good too.\n\nThe atmosphere was buzzing too, with a stand-up performance going on through the back. Later, there was live music, but the place noticeably quietened down at around half 10. \n\nAlso, the waiting staff were really friendly, which is always nice. Was certainly a better choice than waiting around in the soggy cold for a half-decent bit of pizza in Assembly George Square Gardens."
1,"Adam and his team painted the interior of my house this weekend and it looks phenomenal! He came highly recommended by a couple friends so I did not even bother looking around. I am so happy that I had this done. \nAdam came to do an estimate and said they usually run about 6 weeks out, which was fine with us. He kept in contact and emailed later the next week to say they had an opening that Saturday if I was interested. So the house was painted all in one day just 2 weeks after the estimate. \nThey painted the entire downstairs and hallway up the stairs and the hall upstairs as well as one of the bedrooms. \nI love the house more now that it is painted and I never had to pick up a paint brush. I would use this service again in a heartbeat!"
1,"Like down to earth pubs?  Love listening to live music?  Then Whistle Binkies is the place for you.  \n\nThey have live bands playing 7 days a week, loads and loads on the line up each day.  Check out the website to see what's on - http://www.whistlebinkies.com/gigs/  It also describes the music genre so you can plan your night depending on your tastes.  \n\nWith lots of drink promotions, a spacious bar and room for a boogie this really is a great little spot.  Open until 3am every night this is a great alternative to the Edinburgh club scene.  They also hold open mic nights if you want to show off your talents."
0,"One would think that there are only casinos on the Las Vegas Strip or Old Downtown Las Vegas. Guess again!!!!\n\nThere are several casinos outside these areas, but they aren't as \""spectacular\"" in the typical \""LV scene\"" as one might think. So all in all - not much to expect from here other than the gambling.\n\nWhat has gotten worse about the casino is that it has gotten a bit \""cheese-y\"" with the decor. It has no theme. In addition, the ventilation has gotten worse and you know how you walk into a Korean BBQ and smell like that after you've eaten there? Well once you walk through this casino for a good 5-10 minutes, your clothes will possibly smell like you've smoked a pack. Just sayin'.....................\n\n**CONFESSION**\nI'm not much of a gambler. I'm even scared of loosing $1 on a slot machine! I always feel that if I'm going to spend $, I should benefit in some type of rewards wether it is in a form of retail therapy or indulging in meals. So I cannot attest to the casino level of Sunset Station nor the Hotel since I didn't stay here either. But I would imagine it would be a lot cheaper since you're not staying on the strip. You'd just pay for the commute. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSo why am I writing a review about this place if I didn't spend the night here nor contribute any losses on the slot machines?\n\nIt's because if I'm in the area (Henderson) and visiting my grandmother, we would watch movies at their Regal Theaters. I can remember watching movies here since I was in elementary school. Yes the place is a bit dim, carpet sucks, bathroom needs an upgrade, but for some things that they have improved upon are the seats in the theaters and the screens. \n\nOverall, you won't get the razzle-dazzle-ness from the typical casino, but you can watch a movie here in peace and serenity. Just be cautious you'll smell like cigarettes after you've watched a movie........"
1,"The great thing abotu Red Rock is that it's far enoguh from The Strip to be free of crowds and touristy nonsense. I don't gamble or anything like that, but I do frequent the movies here and, on occasion, the bowling alley. You can usually count on no crowds here. We walked up to Harry Potter 7.0 on opening night and got great seats for four."
0,"I was super excited to try this buffet since the pictures made it look so good. But lo and behold, i was quite disappointed. \n\nThe food was pretty mediocre. Below average even. The prime rib was decent BUT they had no au jus for it. What kind of establishment has no au jus for prime rib!?? this one.\n\nThe salmon was normal. Little on the dry side. \n\nThe kalbi was ok. Little chewy, but flavor was good. \nThe spicy tuna roll was good. Actually spicy with little rice. \nThe salmon roll was just ok. Normal. \nFried chicken was just ok. It wasn't dry. But the flavor was lacking. \nThai mango salad has a good flavor, but the noodles were raw. I think they coulda cooked it and just serve it cold, but it was actually raw. Blech.\n\nMac and cheese was made to order. (Everyone said it was good, but I did not have it personally.)\n\nAll in all, I tried almost everything. And there was nothing I wanted to devour. I was disappointed with the food.\n\nThe desserts, I must say, were quite pleasing.\n\nThe gelato was super crazy good. All the flavors were good. The chocolate dipped strawberries were good. The fruit stuffed macarons were good. All the desserts were quite yummy. I  think I ate 5 of those mini chocolate waffle cones. The only thing worth mentioning was their dessert. \n\nService was ok. Little slow. \n\nFor about $44, I think I would rather frequent the Wynn or Bellagio buffet."

0,"The Pharmacy at this Walgreens is the worst I've ever been to. I gave them a prescription on Saturday only to be told that they did not have the medicine in, that I would have to wait until Monday. Monday rolls around, no call. I called them and was told it still wasn't ready when I questioned why not I was put on hold. The male pharmacist told me I just got it in I'll have it ready in 20 mins. That call took place at approximately 10:30am, I arrived to pick up my prescription close to 5pm only to be told that they couldn't fill it because they couldn't read the doctors handwriting. When the Pharmacy manager called me he apologized for the mis-communication however we would not be able to order the medicine if it wasn't in stock if we couldn't read the prescription. I let him know that I didn't magically pull that answer out of no where and was offended that he would even imply that I did. He wanted to know if I had a name. I asked him how many times does his staff introduce themselves when a customer pulls up to the drive thru window, because none ever had to me. He said they should I said they don't and that would be a good place to start. I let him know that asking me an open ended question like what would you like for us to do is ridiculous, what can you do for me other than fill my prescription. My account had no notation regarding the medicine not being in stock. I let him know that the first time a pharmacists is handed a prescription they should begin to take ownership until that customer is leaving with their medicine in hand, and that they should take better care when noting their customers accounts. The managers lax attitude left me frustrated as I told him they get their direction from him and that his customer service skills were piss poor so theirs would be also. No care and concern at all. I will take my business else where."

0,"Although nothing major went wrong with my massage, it was certainly not at all relaxing or what I had expected.\nI write this review in attempt to help those who are considering Tranquil Massage for the first time, as well as the business owner or manager. I understand not everyone can afford to get a massage at a high-end spa, but I think whomever considers a massage here needs to have clear expectations.\nI booked my appointment online, requested a female therapist, and even selected my appointment time based on a \""Renee\"" who would be my therapist. Upon arrival to the building, my first thought was, 'maybe I should just go home.' Not exactly what you want to feel when you are about to be half naked with a stranger. I had been given the massage as a gift from a relative, so I thought I may as well walk-in to see what this place was all about - you know, 'never judge a book by its cover.' Upon walking in the building, I nearly bumped into a male (at the time didn't realize that he was a therapist), who just asked, \""Are you here for a massage?\"" I replied yes, and he turned around (was he getting ready to leave?) and lead me into a cold waiting area - no frills, clean, but uncomfortable, smelled kinda funky. He never told me his name, or asked for my name, confirming that I had an appointment. He asked me to fill out a medical form. While I filled it out, I heard another male voice arguing with someone on the telephone.  At this point, I was thinking, 'where is Renee?', and thought maybe he was just getting me all set while she finished up another client or something. I had to use the restroom before we started, and while in there, I thought, 'maybe I should just walk out.' But, again tried to talk myself through it, thinking that I shouldn't be so judgemental, and that I'm sure everything was fine. So I went back. He walked me into a less-than-impressive massage room - again, cold, terrible lighting, and scantily furnished. He started to review my form with me, as I thought, 'is he the one doing my massage? should i tell him I requested a female?' For some reason, I didn't say anything. I guess still hopeful that it wasn't him that would be giving me a massage. UNTIL, he said he would wait outside while I undressed to my comfort level. (1st rule of spa business, if a client requests a female, don't ignore the request. If only a male is available, call the client to confirm it is OK.)  I thought, 'well I guess this is it...'  He came back and began my massage. He was nice enough, and seemed to ask the right questions, however the massage was mediocre at best. The whole time I kept thinking about how uncomfortable I was, the lights were left on bright - which I guess was good so that I didnt feel that I was in a dark room with a strange man, but also a terrible practice for a spa, the music was too loud, I could hear cars driving by outside the window, a cricket was chirping throughout, and even the way the therapist rubbed lotion in his hands bothered me. My mind was buzzing so much with all the things that seemed wrong, or made me uncomfortable, in the end, I just couldn't wait to go home. I wished that I had just left the multiple times I thought about it when I first arrived.\nBased on the other Yelp reviews on the therapists that ARE actually listed on the company website, they sound legit. However, for whomever owns this business, and any potential future clients, you need to be aware of how terrible my expereince was. There are many lessons that should be taken from my review, and I hope, for the sake of the business and others who may encounter what I did, that the persons in charge of this company's image spend less time worrying about getting \""likes\"" on Facebook and producing marketing materials, until they have the basics down."
0,"I went in for a wax. Perhaps that was my mistake; maybe they just Polish...not wax. Either way, be weary. The woman who walked me used huge clunky chunks of wax and pulled like a pansy.  I could have done it better myself.  I was miserable and in pain."
0,The worst service experience I have had in years tonight.  No refills and finally had to go and ask for my check.
1,"This weekend was the 311 celebration of 311 Day.  My best friend got VIP and took me along for the experience of a lifetime and we had a blast.  I didn't even know the band was still making music until they released Sunset in July last year.  \n\nAnyway, the vibe was amazing and the show was fantastic!  The sound was decent, lighting was AMAZING, and the seats were even better believe it or not.  This venue is not super huge, but not too small either; I can't fathom having a bad seat.   I love that when you arrive to the venue there is a specific person standing with plastic cups waiting to pour your drinks out of their glasses for easy and safe consumption!  I LOVE Vegas!!!"
1,"Love this place! Great burgers, and amazing shakes. We've been going here for years and years, it's a must stop if you are in or going through Wickenburg. try the pineapple shake and of course a cheeseburger!"
0,I'm not in the habit of givng bad reviews to a restaurant but unfortunately this place gets one from me. Me and my friend came to Vegas for the weekend- came to this place because I got a coupon and an e-gift card from Restaurant. Com. I thought that they would be able to get the discount code from my smartphone - waitress said they only accept hard copy coupons (at most other restaurants they just take the code from the phone!) Service was slow - beef tibs not very flavorful -wait staff not very friendly. I'm used to the great tasting food and excellent service of Rosalind's in L.A. In a way it's good we came here-know not to come here next time!
1,Great pizza. 2 slices for $4.50.\n Best food deal in all of downtown.
0,"Came here with the BF last year with one of those VIP tickets.  TAO Beach itself is pretty small and packed.  There's nowhere to stand and trying to get drinks is horrendous. People pushing you as if they were giving out free drinks or something.\nWe actually enjoyed the other part of the pool area better. Plus, you can still hear the music from there, so why not?"
1,"They treated us like family at dinner last night, like we were old friends reuniting. This was absolutely the best service I've ever experienced in Vegas and I've been to all the fancy restaurants, stayed at Bellagio, Venetian, Trump, Caesars, Aria... And this restaurant tops them all!\n\nThank you Mark and the whole staff for truly providing superior hospitality, I now remember what that means. We will no doubt be back every time we visit."
0,THis restaurant is terrible my family and I were seated after waiting 15 min and was never waited on. We sat at our table for over 30 minutes and no one came to take our drink order much less food. IT was like we were not even there. This place has terrible service. Stay away
1,"Did you see my picture of the mozz salad? THEY MADE A BOWL OUT OF PROSCIUTTO. Life cannot get better. I've been here 4-5 times. I always love it. I love their basil gimlet. And now, I love this salad. Such a guilty pleasure."
1,"Within seconds of finally getting my brother moved into his new house.\nMy first question is \""where's the nearest  casino\""? \n\nMy brother said \""Red Rock, five minutes east\"".\n\nMe: WTF??? Lets get going dude. LIKE NOW!!\n\nHim: Don't you want to take a shower first?\n\nMe: Do I stink?\n\nHim: No but you're kinda dusty and haggard looking.\n\nMe: Fuck you, this is my look.... I call it the \""too old to give a rat's ass look\"", you don't approve?\n\nHim: Do I have a choice?\n\nMe: No now lets FUCKING GO. I have exactly 6 hours before I have to head to the airport.\n\nAnd that is how I got to check out the Red Rock. Nice fuckin place. I was kinda dirty yes but I fit in pretty well. Seems like a locals place. Maybe because it's so far off the strip. Maybe it's the time we went (early Monday).\nLot's of  clueless Texas hold em players. Cocktail waitresses are quick as bunnies... which got me to thinkin \""I wonder if they fuck like bunnies to\"" yet I digress. Thanks for you're hard earned money bitches.This place would rate 4 stars whether I won or lost. Others won't be so lucky in future reviews."
0,"The workers aren't nice and it smells like burnt hair inside. Everything is pretty cheap and readily available. They carry a lot of hair dye that no other place does and it's cheap, which I love. Other than their prices, though, it's not too great of a store. The employees need to learn how to say hello."
1,The best katsu my bf and I have ever had in our entire lives! And we are Japanese hahaha. The service is on point! We love the katsu sliders and both the salmon and chicken katsu...it's all delicious.
1,"Finally, a Hawaiian spot in South Summerlin!  \n\nI was a little afraid to try this place.  The location was previously inhabited by two failed Mexican restaurants.  I figured the spot must be cursed. But, rejoice all, I think this place will last.   \n\nAlthough sparse and plain, the cafe serves up some pretty decent Hawaiian fare.  The menu is nowhere near as large as places like Island Flavor or Aloha Kitchen, but they seem to have a handle on the classics. If you're looking for Lau Lau, however, you're out of luck.\n\nI tried the Kalua Pork & Cabbage ($10.95) which came with two scoops of rice and mac salad. Unfortunately, I found the rice a tad wet and mushy.  Maybe they need a new rice cooker?  But, otherwise, I thought the pork and cabbage was divinely moist and flavorful.  Just add a little Hawaiian chili water and dig in.  I also appreciated the macaroni salad that wasn't caked in mayo.\n\nI also ordered the spam musubi which came freshly made and piping hot.  I would definitely order it again (it was a pretty big brick for $2.00). Prett-eh tasty.\n\nI'm gonna keep my fingers crossed that they start serving Lau Lau (hint, hint, nudge, nudge, Kauai Cafe). Then I'm in trouble."
1,"The first time I had food from here, I didn't even have to go here. Food just fell on my lap and it was forkin glorious. The first time I actually went here, I was a bit lost since I'm kind of blind even with my hipster glasses on. It's right next door to O Face Doughnuts. I've also been here for my post-workout birthday lunch and a few other times...all because of a bowl of vegetables!\n\nChicken:\nChicken thigh that's simple but tasty. The skin is crisp but not overcooked. It's quite juicy. I paired this with their broccoli which was a bit spicy 4.5/5\n\nRainbow Cauliflower:\nThis is my favorite item on the menu. I never thought I'd say that the best dish I've had was a bowl of veggies let alone cauliflower! What crazy friggin ish is that? As a matter of fact, I crave a bowl all the time now. Garlicky, a bit of spice and a bit citrusy. I could eat this all day. A glowing 5/5\n\nCocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak:\nTender slices of beef with pink on the middle. Earthy and nutty because of the cocoa espresso but without being bitter. 4/5\n\nSwordfish: \nFlaky white fish with lemon, mint and basil. Refreshing, light and delicious 5/5\n\nYoung Beets:\nI don't normally get too crazy over beets. The texture is mushy and tastes like dirt - CK was able to make me like beets. 4/5\n\nGyro Tacos:\nGreek tacos with tender meat, feta and onions. Nothing complicated here. 4/5\n\nChicken Skin:\nComes with honey to dip the crunchy salty goodness that is chicken skin. Forget your healthy eating habits for a moment and indulge in this basket of magnificence. *crunch crunch crunch crack crack crack* was all I heard when this was brought to our table. 5/5\n\nTomato Stack:\nCaprese salad, basically. 4/5\n\nMac n Cheese:\nI don't know how they made such a simple comfort food to be better than most places. The crispy top, the creamy cheese sauce...yuuuummm!!! 5/5\n\nDevil's Eggs:\nDeviled eggs with caviar and pancetta. Absolutely delicious. With the caviar and pancetta, I thought this would be salty but I was wrong. Different textures in my mouth. 4.5/5\n\nThey have a few tables by the window, a few stools by the kitchen and by the bar, and a community table. They also have outdoor seating. This is one of my favorite spots in Downtown Las Vegas."

0,"If you're ok with take-out quality Chinese food at Vegas casino prices, this place will do. If you want sushi, avoid it. The sushi was flavorless, rubbery, viciously overpriced. Their saki menu is limited to $40/bottle low end stuff and $16/bottle pink stuff. Not a Japanese restaurant. I've had supermarket sushi experiences that trump this by a mile."
1,Today was my 2nd visit and must say was just as impressed as I was a month ago. Staff is friendly and helpful - explained things well when I asked several questions. \n\nAll burgers come complete with 2 patties and are very filling. Sweet potato tater tots are delicious!
1,"This is a great place to have fun getting reacquainted with you youth and $20 goes a long way.\n\nI first went there when I heard that the PSP Gotleib & Williams pinball collections were built based on games that they studied at the arcade.  I then found out that besides the money it takes to run the place, the owners give all the profit to charities.\n\nIf your looking for something that the entire family can enjoy, give it a shot."
1,"I was on a solo trip to Vegas, figured out it maybe a good idea to spend a day at the spa to pamper myself.\n\nI called to the reception at 10am, they were able to schedule me for a message and eyebrow wax for the same day. I walked down from my room to the spa around 11:30am, the hostess was waiting me and she kindly brought me upstairs for a walkthrough. I changed and got myself a tea and some snacks at the waiting area; the hostess came back 5mins before my first appointment and led me into the treatment suite where my massage therapist was waiting. The massage therapist recommended a few scent oil to me and the one I picked was something with ginger; I fell asleep just few minutes into the message.\n\nAfter the message, I returned to the reception area and asked if I can order room service. The staff helped me to order and she told me since it was a slow day, I could eat my lunch in the waiting area. I then went to the steam room and the food was ready when I returned. \n\nSecond treatment was the eyebrow wax which I have never done it before; I just felt I needed one so badly because my eyebrows were merging with my hair line. The technician took her time to explain to me about her work and understand my expectation; I felt comfortable when I let a total stranger to work on my face.\n\nI spent rest of my day in the meditation room and woke up felt like a new person. I am thinking of doing this for my annual getaway from now on."
0,"Lemongrass is located inside Aria hotel right next to blossom. I came here for lunch two days ago with a party of about 10. The service was awful. When we sat down, there was no waiter to be found anywhere near by. I kept having to turn my head back and forth just so I can wave one down. I had to walk to the hostess stand to ask for some menu's to look at. By the time the waiter came, we were ready to order. \n\nI ordered the thai tea as my beverage. It took almost 10 minutes to come out. The thai tea wasn't sweet enough. I've had better. \n\nMy boyfriend & I shared the jellyfish and the Lemongrass prawns as the appetizers. I don't recommend the jellyfish. It was too largely cut that it was so hard to chew. I wish it was thinly sliced. So the \""Lemongrass prawns\"" came out. And it looks like a fishcake or something. So I asked the waiter what it was and he said fish cake. I told him we didn't order that and that was ordered prawns. So he added that in as well. Then the \""prawns\"" came out and it was an eggroll prawn. There was 3 different waiters at this table and they were all saying different things. Finally we verified that it was the Lemongrass prawn and just turn into a mousse. The Lemongrass Prawns was actually pretty decent. It was just a hassle to figure out what everything was. \n\nAs our entree we ordered the drunken noodles with seafood. It was okay. The portion was kind of small. There wasn't enough flat noodles. It was about $20 for this dish. \n\nI thought this restaurant was pretty pricey for an \""Asian\"" restaurant. And it wasn't even satisfying."
0,"I've been here twice but have only had one cut. The first time, I was just leaving the house to go to my appt and the girl (can't remember her name) called to say that she was in Tempe and couldn't make it because I was her only appt in Phoenix. When I told her I was a tad annoyed, she then said, 'I have a family emergency'. When I told her that I didn't know which story to believe, she put me on hold and called the studio and asked if Julie, the owner, would cut my hair. So thankfully I got in to see Julie who did a good job. Unfortunately, today, six weeks later, I went for my second appointment with Julie. I was told Julie would be 'just a minute'. After 20 minutes of waiting, I asked to see Julie who finally came out to see me and she said she was running late. I told her I couldn't really wait much longer, and I left. I won't be going back. I\""m glad other people have had a good experience here but, in my two experiences with the studio, they didn't respect my time enough to warrant me going back again."
0,"We enjoyed our food but not the half-hearted service. Our waiter, Michael was all business and no pleasure. Asking about the menu seemed like an inconvenience. When we asked him what type of soda they had he simply answered \""Pepsi products\"" to my 7 year old. When I asked if he could tell us what \""Pepsi products\"" again it seemed like a total inconvenience. When we asked him for the desert menu he said it was not printed and grudgingly told us what they were, leaving out the gelato option. When we asked him to repeat it, he only repeated half of the deserts. The restaurant wasn't even full. Needless to say we didn't stay for dessert even though we had planned on it as it was Grandma's birthday. He made the experience mediocre."
1,"Good hike that gets straight to the point. Went on a holiday so it was pretty crowded. As others have mentioned, this is strenuous and I dont know that a younger child could make it all the way up. My 5 year old made it half the way up before we had to turn back. All in all, still worthwhile."
1,Great place for a nice kickback dinner. The salmon and steak were awesome. Will definitely be back for happy hour when even those awesome steaks are half off!!!
0,"I haven't even gotten my food yet and I don't even care. \nWe walked in and we sat ourselves us being the only people in the entire store.. oh and somebody at the bar. Someone got our drinks then we waited.. waited.. and waited for our waitress that the busser told us that would come by. Our menus are closed in front of us so I figured that was the sign for \""were ready\"".. \nThe waitress is chatting with somebody at the bar which is fine, probably taking their order. The busser asks if he could start something for us, i let him know we were ready to order.. he went back to tell the server.. So the busser or whoever came back after a few minutes and asked if he could relay the message back to the waitress of what we wanted. Ok sure. \nSo he walks to her and tells our order to her, which I thought was weird because it wasn't busy. We were the only table. I guess since I'm a server I expected something different.. won't be back."
0,Dont't pay with credi/ATMt card. They will change the tip line. I think it was the manager that did it too.
1,"Unlike other reviewers said, with me, they have always answered their phones promptly and the front desk ladies are always very friendly. The entire staff so far has been great. My baby is seen by doctor Lillie, and she's awesome, she's very nice and helpful and doesn't mind answering all the questions I always have for her. I also never have to wait in the waiting room for too long, which is great."
0,"No one felt like going out in the heat, so we ordered in a pizza - thin crust, mushrooms, pepperoni and garlic. The phone service was great, the delivery time SUPER-fast,even though it was the lunch rush.\n\nBut, unfortunately, the pizza wasn't really all that, in my opinion. The toppings and flavor were alright, though quite salty -- the sauce was sweeter rather than zestier, but the garlic was cooked well and the pepperoni was sufficiently savory.\n\nThe cut it in squares (like Marco's, which is way better, IMO) and I do like that kind of cut.\n\nBut I didn't care for the crust. It's definitely a Chicago-style crust -- not chewy, not crispy, kind of airy and bready, even the thin crust. I think if that's your thing, you'll like this pizza -- it's just not my jam.\n\nThey're pretty pricey for pizza, so beware.  $17 for a large, plus $2 per topping. By the time we were done (added on cheesebread at the last minute, but received cheesesticks), it was a $33 pizza.\n\nMeh."
0,"Will never come here again!\n\nMy cat has cancer and was experiencing some new symptoms that needed possible ultrasounds. We came to this CVS location because it was after hours and the CVS I usually go to in Matthews wasn't going to have the ultrasound tech as soon as needed, so we drove 30 minutes in the opposite direction to this location in Huntersville.\n\nWhen we walked in around 10PM on a Friday, the place was packed to the brim. All the exam rooms were full and there were about 10 people in the lobby. Okay, so maybe that night we just had bad luck?\n\nNo. Our greeting at the front desk was awful. The secretary didn't even make eye contact with us and acted like we were inconveniencing her. She was appalling and rude. \n\nWe were told we would have to wait at least an hour because they were overly busy, which we understood. After a couple hours, we asked if we could just check our sick kitty into the ICU for the night and leave because we knew she needed overnight supervision.  Well, the secretary didn't even come relay the NO response to us.\n\nLuckily, not all of the staff were as dreadful as the secretary. But we ended up waiting over 5 hours (until 3:30AM), only to be told that they were admitting her into the ICU overnight and running tests (exactly as we requested before). I know the protocol was to have the doctor chat a moment in person before we left, but we felt that common sense wasn't being put to use at this facility."
1,"Having tried the great food offered at Hot Pot, I decided to give this restaurant a try. I arrived for lunch on a saturday and was fortunate to be the only and maybe first customer for the day so I was able to actually chit-chat with the owner and meet her mother. This was definitely not a Jamaican restaurant and the big mural of Guyana, painted by a sister as well as the menu reflected the name of the restaurant. Beside the usual fare, there was roti and even a rice-bowl which probably alluded to size and nothing asian. My food was brought out by Salvador, the chilango chef who has obviously been trained by the owner's mom. I ordered the Ox-tail as well as the Brown Stew Chicken, both both rice & peas. I decided to get an order of curried goat as well as jerk chicken to go.\nThe portions were impressive and I was already warned that the rice & peas varied according to the peas/beans they chose to use on a particular day. Today....it was great. The ox-tail was good although not as impressive as Hot Pot.  As for the brown stew chicken...well...that's always a staple on jamaican/caribbean menus and I have always avoided ordering it, just because there is nothing in the name that suggests anything exotic or special. I left, still wondering \""What is Brown Stew Chicken?\"". Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the meal. It tasted decent, like chicken should; served in a gravy/sauce which is probably the \""stewed\""  part of the name, and since I don't really have any references to compare it to,  suffice it to say, I would be comfortable whipping it up on my won after following any online recipe. Both meals were served with steamed & seasoned cabbage which was delicious. I have yet to try the other 2 dishes I purchased which I will eat later today. I was told that they will prepare jerk pork and the guyanese speciality, \""Pepperpot\"" if given sufficient notice. I am looking forward to trying both.  Overall, I enjoyed my meals and plan on returning to sample all the items on the menu."
1,"Windsor makes quinoa taste so good, that I've started turning down things like pulled pork and mac & cheese. Seriously. Quinoa over mac & cheese, who gave me crazy pills?! \n\nSeriously, I'd like to take them every day so I can continue to eat this healthy."
0,"If you happen to come across this little hole in the wall. The thought might pop into your head that this will be one of those great hidden gems. Well let me tell you know. Its not.\n\nAccording to my mother it used to be amazing a decade ago. But no longer. To be fair the gigantic hole in the ceiling right before you enter should have been our first clue. But it was almost 6pm and I hadn't eaten all day. Not to mention I've eaten amazing food in way shadier places. So we went in. The place is roomy, lots of parking and places to sit. But the decor mixed with the soft jazz they play is reminiscent of an old school gangster film. I spent my whole meal waiting for Sollozzo and McCluskey to meet their end.\n\nAs for the food. I was shocked there was so little vegeterian friendly options. Which lead me to order an awkward looking plate of vegetables and chow mein. What it really was a can of hard noodles under a mix of onions and bean sprouts. With a mystery flavorless white sauce drenched through out. My not vegeterian associate got the sweet and sour shrimp. Which was ridiculously over battered. I was so hungry and disatiasfied with my meal I found myself eating her leftover batter. Which still had a bit of sweet and sour sauce on it. The sauce was probably the only redeeming factor food wise. We did have a nice and fast waitress.\n\nLong story short, I ate a grilled cheese when I got home."
0,Beautiful place. Just wish the taste of the food matched the decor.
0,"I never thought my favorite class would be the gym, but I absolutely love it! The people who oversee the gym are very friendly, and encouraging. I have never seen too many people in the gym, it has always had a dozen or so or less in it, so it is comfortable. If you are thinking about a routine, this is a great place to get your start, they also have other classes you may like, such as yoga,track, belly-dancing or karate.  If it wasn't for the gym, I would have been long gone from this school from hell. \n\nAs you can probably see by now, I am not a complete fan of the academics at MCC. I have taken around 30 credits here, and although I have a pretty decent GPA, some of the part-time online instructors are fairly 'feral' towards students( for some odd reason) which just messes up my degree plans.\n\n  MCC has a 16% (or was it 14%?)  graduation rate. The lowest in the nation. You can see the statistics yourself if you log into your FAFSA. Who needs a degree- right? Obviously this is play time. (sarcasm) \n\nI'd say avoid the Religion at MCC, that one is a joke- save your money! I think it is ran by a bunch of secular-rabid-lesbian atheists."
1,"Blue.  Your Friday night just got a lot more exciting! \n\nThe restaurant was busy, but not jam packed on an impromptu Friday night dinner date.  While we weren't dressed to the nines, they were ok with letting us in!  \n\nThere is a lot to choose from on the menu, but the way it is divided makes it much more navigable. It is divided into appetizers, mid courses, salads, cheese courses, entrees, and specials.  \n\nWe began with the Tega Hills bibb lettuce salad with warm duck confit, as well as the Moroccan Kefta meatballs.  The salad was scrumptious.  It was really working that whole sweet and salty thing.  Meatballs were not my pick, but WOW they were good.  Served with a charmoula sauce which is heavy on the garlic, parsley and cumin, in a very good way.\n\nPer our waitress' recommendation (who was GREAT by the way), I had the pan seared Australian sea bass.  It was served on top of a diced butternut squash with ginger brown butter.  It was light  yet decadent at the same time.  \n\nOur waitress gave great recommendations and was totally enthusiastic about the menu.  I love it when people get as excited about food as me. We really enjoyed our experience and would be back in a flash."
0,So over-hyped and I didn't enjoy the food. Think I'll try the Main next time...
1,Good place to go for nice mature fun. Good music and good people.
1,"This is the new hot spot at the Encore. Really beautiful setting and incredible food. I have no issues with this restaurant. I went there on a Thursday and there was a local special which is $7 food and drink items!\n\nI ate with a friend and we had amazing food and drinks for $35 at an upscale restaurant. I am also going again this Thursday! They had a dj and this is something that stuck out to me because most restaurants wouldn't dare try this.\n\nThe DJ played 80's, funk, and soul. I go out a decent amount and I kept saying oh I love this song I love that song! It is a really cool atmosphere when you can add some music without being intrusive. I think the dj added something great to this place. \n\nThe decor is outstanding! There are eyes that change colors on a giant screen when you walk in. There are tear drop lights throughout the restaurant and my goodness the chairs were so comfortable I didn't want to get up. It could have been all the yellowtail or dim sum that I ate haha! I give this restaurant 5 stars."
0,"Excited about my first dining experience today at the breadfruit at 108 E Pierce St downtown Phoenix. Learned about the establishment while researching  suggested restaurants from my companies vendor for a large group coming to town in March. Was told at 6:10pm that there was a two hour wait and that it's best to make a reservation before dining. Well of course I was not going to wait two hours to eat dinner. So we left. Then it hit me, the white couple in front of us that arrived at the same time wasn't leaving nor did they have reservations. Why were they staying and we weren't?!?! So at 6:17pm I called the restaurant from my car to make a 7pm reservation. The same person, Dwayne (who said he was the owner) told me he could accommodate us at 7:30pm. Definitely not two hours. Maybe my voice didn't sound Black like my face looked. What a huge let down!!! I will do my best to spread the word about my unfortunate experience at breadfruit."
0,"And my tour of the C-list shows continues. I know there are some people that really dig the musical impersonators. I'm just not one of them unless they're doing Pink Floyd or Rush since the band has to be pretty awesome to get that stuff down. \n\nOverall I would rather see a great cover band than impersonators for pop stuff (Zowie Bowie?). My order of the performers from top to bottom. \n\n1. Elvis: The guy was as good as any other Elvis impersonator I've seen and he lead off the show. Everything you would expect.\n\n2. Michael Jackson: He had the moves. He sang the songs pretty well but why do tunes like \""They Don't Care About Us\"" when there are SOO many other hits that could've taken up that time. The Thriller part was pretty good/funny. \n\nThey also ended the show by singing \""Heal the World\"" and each of the singers did a verse which was so Disneyesque (puke). \n\n3. Charlie Daniels: At least this guy played the violin and did a smoking version of \""Devil Went to Georgia\"". \n\n4. Carrie Underwood: She was a decent singer but I wouldn't say she was an impersonator. Didn't look or sound like her. Plus she did 2 GN'R songs for some reason. \n\n5. Lady Gaga: I felt like this was a bad Halloween drag show. The homemade costumes were funny in a good way but she didn't sound anywhere close to Gaga.\n\nThe band was pretty good. They were able to seamlessly transition from genre to genre really well."
0,"Fabricated hype is the theme for this restaurant chain in Arizona - they intentionally select (nearly) all locations with insufficient parking and insufficient building size to accommodate their customers.  Once you're on the lengthy waitlist along with a small crowd of others, they want you to think.... wow, this is a happening place!\n\nBut the pain doesn't stop here.  The hostess has strict but unreasonable seating rules.  Example: she wouldn't seat my party of 4 at a 4 top table because 2 people were parking the car.  Not even 30 seconds later, she seats a party of 2 at that last remaining 4 top table.  Then, of course, my 2 missing people walk right up and we have to wait 25 minutes for the next available 4 top table.  Great policy, Oreganos!\n\nThis self-styled Chicago theme restaurant offers deep dish pizza, but they're quick to point out how long the wait is for the pizza (likely after you've waited a long time just to get a seat) and so the vast majority of their pizza sales are thin crust.  Not bad, but the reputation for great Chicago pizza isn't exactly \""Chicago thin crust\"".\n\nWall murals are entertaining, as are the self-deprecating T-shirts worn by the staff.  Food is very average, and the menu is quite decorative.\n\nOn the whole though, it's all hype and little in way of substance."
0,"I had an appointment with her, and less than an hour of my appointment, she calls me and cancels. She said that it was a family issue, which I could understand. The bad part about it was that she didn't even apologize! It's been over two weeks now, and I heard nothing from her. With customer service like that, you might as well kiss your business goodbye sooner or later if you treat people like that!"
0,"Readjusting this review to accurately reflect the incompetence of the management staff here.\n\nI want to preface with some credibility. I rented here for 18 months, and utilized all the advertised amenities (the ones that are actually available, not just the advertised ones).\n\nBottom line is don't rent here unless you want to pay for over-priced units, dirty common areas (literally uncleaned barf in the hallways), jacuzzis that don't work, and bbq's that are broken.\n\nThe staff will nickel and dime and not address any of your needs. Read the other reviews to confirm and go rent elsewhere for a better time. It's your money, don't waste it here."
1,"I always love Macs. GOod beer and drinks, and fabulous food. I usually get the whole lotta, just so I can take home leftovers and enjoy it again the next day. When I was pregnant, I had been smelling something delicious in my crockpot all day, but decided to save it for another day because I just HAD TO HAVE Mac's beer can chicken. :)"
0,"Spirit certainly has some really low fares. Now that we have that out of the way, I must say that it certainly is a you get what you pay for airline. \nI fly around a decent amount and I've learned what works with them and what doesn't. \nHere's what works: They fly to a lot of cities, a lot of their flights are direct flights without layovers. The staff at the airports have always been pleasant and courteous. They also have great last minute deals in case your flight is An emergency or if you're going on a spontaneous adventure.  People have said that their flights are bumpy and rickety but I've always had smooth sailing\nNow, here's what doesn't work. I'm about 6'3 and 210 pounds so I expect to be cramped, but their flights take it to another level. Their bag check in fees are higher than most. Their seat choice fee is higher than mist, hell just about anything an airline charges for is higher with spirit. They also love to find ways to nickel and dime the customers.  They also don't have much variety in the sense that their routes only fly once a day, for example the only Vegas to Baltimore flight is an 1130 red eye. It's a deal breaker unless you're flexible. It's also a bit of an issue because if you miss your flight you're straight SOL for awhile\n TL;DR spirit is awesome if your flight is under 3 hours and if you're packing light. Everything else, I'd generally recommend paying the difference and enjoying the comfort"
0,"I've been going to rehab for the last few years and its been on a fast decline the last 2 years.  It started when they got rid of all the Helles Belles dealers inside so now the casino is half full on weekends and club Vanity is far down the list of popular clubs.  I went to Rehab on Memorial weekend and can finally say I am done with this pool scene as it now draws a crowd of mostly degenerates and low end undesireables.  The classy people have all moved on to EBC, Wet Republic or Marquee."
0,"Although some people may have had good experiences with this location, their recent attitude towards clients is sub par.  I've been trying to get a hold of them ever since their open house and nobody returns phone calls, answers messages, and all I get is canned emails.  Part of me would really like to follow through with this venue, but the other part of me is screaming run away.  If NOBODY can get in touch with them to schedule, then how can we expect them to come through.  The latest \""rumors\"" were that the site manager has health problems.  I feel really sorry for her, but if you can run your business, then count me out."
1,"This was such a fun experience! It was our first time ever doing this since art class in 3rd grade!\n\nWe worked with Donna during \""open paint\"" and had such a nice time. We went during an afternoon and timed it perfectly so we had the place to ourselves (we didn't want to be amongst children).  It was like our own private studio and private lesson. \n\nThey supply everything from ideas/inspiration to canvas, supplies, and smocks.  We did not have to set up or clean up, it was awesome! The music was relaxing and we were in our own little world. \n\nAlthough you cannot drink alcohol here, that was not a problem. There is no time to drink and I realized that even if I did have a glass of wine at my painting station, I would not drink it because I wouldn't want to screw up my painting and my paint brush would probably end up in my wine glass! We had brought our own waters and I maybe took two sips in the 3 hours we were there. I was so focused, I forgot to hydrate!  However, we did go have a drink afterwards! \n\nIf you have questions or concerns just call them, they are super friendly and very accommodating."
0,"I just went to this location after trying to call them for the past 2 days and no one answering the phone.  I went there and it was not open.  It was boarded off and there was a big sign saying they were reopening in November.  I called the corporate offices to let them know that there should be a recording or something letting people know this location is not open.  I am ill and leaving the house is very, very difficult for me.  I can't tell you how disappointed I was to finally get there and it wasn't even open.  Then to call the main 800 number and speaking with a supervisor, she 1 - didn't even offer to take my order (ask if she could help me with the product I was looking for)  and 2 - didn't even offer something to make up for my time, gas, and affecting my health (like free shipping or something off of my next order), I don't expect handouts, but it would have been nice to have some kind of assistance today.  :-("

0,"I just ate the Gyro sandwich combo and let me say it was disgusting! What an insult to REAL gyros! I had no other option but to eat it so I didn't starve but do NOT get this dish!! The gyro wasn't authentic at all! Instead of the lamb being shaved (which is the correct way) they must have cooked it on a grill and cut it up. NEVER DO THAT!!! Then the cucumber sauce to go with it was the worst I have ever had! First it had this weird color to it then they added weird spices so it didn't taste right. The only thing they got right about the sauce was that it had some cucumbers in it. Unfortunately my coworkers had chosen this place to pick up food from and because of this horrible dish I will never order anything from here again!! Sadly I had to spend $8.99 for this disgusting food, too!! \n\nDO NOT GO HERE!!!! \n\nAlso, one of my coworkers ordered the Baja Burrito and she said it was too spicy and just \""ok\"". There was nothing special about it and it looked like a big blob."
0,"This was the first Vegas club/lounge I went to... and boy, was it a forgettable one. \n\nFirstly, the venue is packed with guys... with an occasional woman here and there, however, since there is no dance area really, the herds of men shower the bar area while the few women stand on the outside of the watering hole that are the main bars. The Guy-girl ratio was a good 15-1... not my type of venue. Coyote Ugly also draws in an older crowd (which is okay, but not for someone who just turned 21). The music was not very good and our entertainment consisted of bar tenders dancing on bar tops and encouraging middle-aged women to do something \""crazy\"" like dancing on a bar top. Conversely, the herds of men watch and watch and watch for something crazy to happen... and nothing ever does. \n\nI don't see how this place could be satisfying for men or women. The only niche I see for Coyote Ugly is drawing in a middle-aged crowd seeking to get away from the pretentious Vegas scene and be in a venue where you will not really be bothered. Unless that is your scene, expect to be bored out of your mind."
0,"Paradise Bakery you are not.  I'm sorry, you're just not a paradise to me.  And I hold bakeries near and dear, believe me.\n\nYou are a common bakery - I'm not sure how many states you are in but you are common.  Maybe that's your problem.  Your locations are fine.  Nice enough.  You have free wifi.  Good.  But your muffins?  They just don't do it for me.  They fall short of similar establishments offerings in the valley and in other areas.  Go to Wildflower Bread and get yourself a Morning Glory muffin.  This is what young muffins dream of becoming when they grow up.  \n\nAnd your cookies.  They are so prefab tasting.  My wife had an oatmeal raisin cookie and offered me a bite.  She broke off a good size piece and I tried it.  It was doughy.  And there were no raisins.  And I had to look to find a flake of oatmeal.  But they were sugary in that prefab, gritty, not very good sort of way.  An oatmeal raisin cookie should taste like...oatmeal.  And raisins.  And perhaps a hint of nutmeg and cinnamon, not gritty sugariness and doughiness.  Blech."
1,"For my second visit to a buffet during my weekend stay, we hit the seafood buffet at the Rio.  After about a 30 minute wait in line, we paid our $29.99 (thanks to a $10 off coupon that one of our group received when he check in at Ballys) and we were seated. We lucked out and got a high table with bar stools.\n\nWe specifically picked this buffet because we wanted seafood and we were not disappointed.  So much seafood!  And the majority of it was pretty good.  Well worth the wait and the money.\n\nThe little lobster tails thingies were tasty and they were always filled with fresh servings. I really enjoyed the chinese style crab legs more than the steamed ones. Nice and messy and flavorful.  The only disappointment was the crawdads, they were on ice. I would have much preferred hot one to dip in my melted butter. \n\nEven though we went just for the seafood, I had to fill a little of my stomach with some meat and the prime rib was quite good. Got a nice rare piece too. Yummers.\n\nDessert was good too. I loved the Wheel of Gelato...thought the 90 year old chinese guy serving it was quite grumpy and only mumbled if you asked him what the flavors were that didn't have a sign on them.\n\nWe left stuffed and satisfied.  And though it was a Saturday night at 10:30pm when we left, my belly was so full I decided to just go back to the hotel room and lay on the bed like a beached whale instead of going out to the wee hours of the morning."
1,"All you chocolate elitists can turn your noses up at See's all you want.  I love it, and I always will.\n\nSee's was the \""special\"" candy my family tried to order every Christmas.  Back in those days before the internet (we still had 8-track tape players) at a time when no one really knew anything existed other than what you had seen, there was Russell Stover, Whitman's Samplers (that my cheap ass uncle was fond of giving in lieu of a real present), and See's.  There was no comparison.  See's was it.  I didn't even know they had stores then, much less stores that give out free candy just for coming in.  Kind of like a test drive without the pressure.\n\nAnd I still prefer See's over it's closest competitor to me, location-wise, Godiva.  Why?  Well, the free candy for one.  Number two, it doesn't cost $60 a pound, more like $16.  Granted, Godiva has prettier packaging and perhaps a better product, but not enough to compromise my loyalty.  \n\nI was recently saddened to see the store at Fashion Square close, but luckily, this one is nearby.  Much larger and easier to shop in, but my only complaint is that I had to stand in line with people hand-picking their boxes to pay for my pre-packaged items.  But since my husband was one of the pickers, I wasn't going anywhere until he was done anyway.  And his box was for me:)"
0,Heard a lot of people raving about this place so I had to try it.
1,"I don't know if all Targets are the same, but this one seems decent.  You can't always find staff when you need them but when you do, many seem personable. They have a small  furniture section, a garden section with plants and barbecue grills, etc., and a mostly-clean tiny cafeteria selling Pizza Hut, hot dogs, pretzels, and other little things. \n\nThe staff don't let the aisles and clothing areas get horridly messy because they are always fixing the shelves and restocking.  The place is bright and clean, which is a hugely important thing to me. Only once in a while have I had to stand in line for longer than I would have liked (I dread the holidays!), otherwise, they seem to staff the registers sufficiently.  Returns have never been a problem for me except that sometimes you have to stand in line at Customer Service for longer than you'd prefer.\n\nParking isn't the most pleasant all the time because it's hot out and you might have to walk a distance, but that's just Vegas (and walking is good for you if you can do it!).  The parking area and the outside of the store are pretty clean, although people tend to leave carts any old place by the curbs.\n\nI shop here all the time- prices are all right for most things, and the plaza is conveniently located with a variety of exits and entrances."
1,"Yelpers all know by now that I'm a 4th generation Japanese-American. But, what many of you don't know is that my Mom is actually Korean.  A significant reason I choose to identify as  Japanese over Korean was because since my childhood the Korean community has always rejected me. I just turned out way too Japanese looking, and my Korean features are philosophically just an non-observable genotype.  No matter how hard I tried to reach out to the Korean community, I was always pushed away.  I've probably only gotten along with 5-6 Korean people in my lifetime, and most of them were Zainichi Koreans or Koreans from South America. Because the Korean community pushed me away my whole life, I grew up not knowing anything about Korean cuisine. So I don't know if SURA is considered \""good Korean food\"" by Korean people, but what matters is that I enjoyed every second of it. \n\nOf course my favorite Korean BBQ joint is and always will be Mr. Jake Lee's Honey Pig, but SURA has some advantages. The main advantage(and maybe the only advantage) is that SURA is a buffet style restaurant and you don't have to wait for a server to bring you more meat. Personally, I like Honey Pig better because they accommodate Japanese people and will give you Yakiniku style meat if you ask the right person.  Also at Honey Pig they cook the meat for you, so you can just sit back and relax. The first time I came to SURA, I badly burned everything causing a lot of black smoke to fill up the area. The server ran over.... and she looked really really pissed. \n\nI really liked the Kalbi here. I also really liked the pork bulgogi. You can tell it's been marinated over night because of the intense flavor. Even the California rolls were pretty good, and I don't even like California rolls. \n\nI'm actually surprised this place has such a high yelp rating because I've noticed that most Korean yelpers tend to give out a lot of 1-star ratings to Korean owned businesses.  They always complain about how the food is not as good as it is in Korea or \""Ellie\""(note- \""Ellie\"" is how a lot of FOB Koreans pronounce L.A.).  I'm giving this place 5-stars because unlike full-Koreans, I actually support Korean business. btw... why is it that every Korean person has an Iphone 5? Shouldn't you guys support Korea and buy the Samsung Galaxy? How unpatriotic!\n\nmy reviews are weird"
1,"One of the best clubs I have experienced in Vegas. Considering just how many people were there, it never felt overcrowded. Loved that you could dance your socks off inside under a beautiful, massive chandelier or kick it outside by a pool that makes you want to strip down to your scibbies and jump in (which some just about did the night I was there) \n\nOverall, great atmosphere, great bartenders, and an amazing time!!"
0,"We come to Phoenix once or twice a year and I've always wanted to try this place.  Needless to say it will be one & done for us.  We purchased, two adult burgers (w/fries), 3 kids meals, onion rings, stuffed mushrooms, & 3 large sodas.  Total was $45.  My wife's comment: \""freakin' rippidy rip off\""... The inside of Long Wongs was very dirty, it looked like it was on a once a week cleaning and it was day 6!  It had that slight greasy grime on the tables, chairs, arcade games.  As for the good, you pay for  drink refills which is rediculous nowadays let alone for a \""wings\"" joint.  Both the adult burgers were very weak, hardly any specialty toppings to give it a specialty flavor and way too much bun for the small preformed frozen patties.   Flavor was nonexistent.  The stuffed mushrooms tasted like they were dropped straight from the freezer into he fat fryer - worst I've ever had.  The onion rings were the best part and the only reason this place got one star. As excited as we were to try this place we were severely disappointed."
1,Charles did a great job installing the new door - and fast!  Avondale's prices were reasonable too. Thanks.
1,"Ok, if you're vegetarian, and like Asian food, just go here! Don't think twice, just go here!\n\nClean tasting Thai food, without the fishy or oily flavor/taste.\n\nWe really enjoyed ourselves here.\n\nThey can make food super spicy, so beware when you ask them to make it spicy.\n\nFood was on point. We ordered a lot of veggie dishes.\n\n- fried tofu\n- Thai fried rice\n- pad see ew\n- cashew tofu\n- basil tofu\n- yellow curry\n\nNot one bad dish to report.\n\nOh, one thing though, they do add on 18% gratuity for big parties. So be prepared to fork over a large tip. Lol."
0,"Well prepared but watered down Thai food.  Potential is huge, but food has been \""Americanized\"".  Sad, because authentic thai food is full of flavors dancing in your taste buds."
1,"Got my clutch done yesterday at this place, which is the first time that I've been here. Didn't even know this shop existed, was just looking for a mechanic that was near my house since my truck is currently my only mode of transportation & was trying to avoid having to call someone to come pick me up or even worse, take the bus home!! (because I knew it would take all day to repair) And hell, Will even offered to give me a ride to my house. Nice guys, I will definitely go back there for future repairs... I never got the vibe at all that they were trying to scam or rip me off, like most other auto repair shops that I've dealt with."
0,"I was at LIFE Nightclub last night at SLS Las Vegas. What a waste of a venue. I've never been to a club with louder \""music\"" in my life. And you can't even call it music, just a whole lot of base with nothing else going on. Imagine dancing to \""base\"" all night, yeah, a  lot of fun huh? Not. AVOID AVOID AVOID.\n\nNow imagine the club with the loudest music you've ever been to, you know the really annoying kind that you think \""what  the heck are they trying to do?\""....and then increase that by 3 times to the point that you cant stand it even if you wanted to because it actually hurts your eardrums and they feel like they're about to explode. AVOID AVOID AVOID.\n\nAnd that's at the entrance! When I walked down to the dance floor it was SO MUCH WORSE! How can you enjoy anything when there's no music, just a bunch of base, and feel like they're going to explode with every beat? You're going to dance when your ears are hurting and you can't have a good time? I don't think so. AVOID AVOID AVOID.\n\nThese people have no clue what good music is and the volume is just plain annoying. Not only that, it's dangerous."
1,"I have eaten at Merchant twice now -- once during Restaurant Week and once a couple months later. For restaurant week, they basically offered their entire menu for $30 instead of the usual $25. They had bargain priced wine and we got a bottle of great wine for $24! My only complaint was that they could have definitely gotten away with making the portions smaller and staying at $25 because I was completely stuffed, even after letting my husband finish my entree, which was pretty much the best thing ever. \n\nThe burata is amazing, the buttermilk salad was good but under-seasoned, and my husband loved the mussels and the beet salad. He also liked the steak and the classic burger But we both agree that the best thing on the menu is the rigatoni with peekytoe crab, which I've gotten both times we've gone. I am not a pasta person, but the rigatoni itself is so perfectly made and cooked, and the crab + sauce are to die for. This dish is the most expensive on the menu, but it is worth every penny. I also highly recommend the Sea Salt Caramel Gelato."
1,"While on business in Las Vegas, I tapped into my network of friends and locals to recommend a new place to eat.  I have my regular spots that I enjoy but this time I wanted something a little different yet close to my hotel, Red Rock.  A few of them actually recommended that I try 808 Tapas in the Summerlin area, which recently opened for business.  \n\n808 Tapas appears to bill itself as an infusion of east & west and sake lounge.  The restaurant was quite easy to find given that its sign stood out among the neighboring businesses.  Upon entering, I was greeted with a warm \""ALOHA\"" by the staff, which was expected since 808 is the area code for the Hawaiian Islands.  From what my friends told me, I should expect Asian/Hawaiian influence fusion style dishes at a reasonable price range.\n\nMy business associate and I started with the Tensai Hamachi Shooters.  This dish caught my as I'm quite the fan of the hamachi shooters served at Michelin Star Alexander's in Cupertino. The hamachi flesh literally melted away in my mouth and the chef did an excellent job to find the perfect balance with the use of white truffle oil with the ponzu sauce.  It is $3 each or $15 for 6.  We opted for the half dozen. This dish is highly recommended!\n\nWe then ordered the Crab Stack Salad at the recommendation of our server.  You will love the way this dish is presented in a stack and then our server began mixing and tossing it table side before we anxiously dug in.  The ginger lime dressing was so refreshing and it complimented the veggies, mango, and the snow crab. This dish was $10 and it was more than enough for two of us to enjoy. What really stood out is the ample amount of snow crab in this dish.  I much prefer this than your usual artificial crab that's served in other sushi restaurants and in your typical \""all you can eat\"" joints.\n\nI took it upon myself to order the Uni Tempura as I am much familiar and enjoy this dish at Nobu.  Much to my surprise, this dish was served exactly like Nobu.  The only difference is it's a larger portion and plated differently.  I suspect there is some Nobu connection amongst the staff here.  If you eat uni, this dish is a must as it's a bargain in price at $10 with a much larger serving than you would get at Nobu.\n\nMy co-worker and I both decided to order the Fish Tacos.  The panko crusted tilapia was cooked to the perfect crisp and I absolutely enjoyed the blood orange slaw which complimented this dish well and this is definitely not your typical bland tasteless fish tacos like you get at xxxhoo's Fish Taco.  This dish was $6 for two tacos and a definite must order.\n\nBeing born and raised in Hawaii, the next dish caught my eye on the menu and I ordered it.  The Lomi Lomi Salmon Caprese is the 808 Tapas take of traditional caprese.  Fresh buffalo mozzarella topped with lomi lomi salmon, a traditional Hawaiian dish of salted salmon, sliced tomatoes, and diced onions drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. This dish was refreshing and I believe it truly represents the 808 area code.  I must commend the chef for his creativity and thought process in the creation of this dish.  You definitely need not be from Hawaii to enjoy this dish!  This dish was $7.50.\n\nWe ordered the Wagyu Beef Sliders.  These sliders were cooked to perfection with just the right amount of pink.  The marinated shiitake mushrooms were TASTY and the Hawaiian ginger wasabi mayo sauce was to die for.  This was one of the best burger/slider I've ever tasted!  I highly recommend this and I'll definitely be coming back just for this!  You get two sliders for $7.50 along with fresh made taro chips that are so addicting you'll be asking if you can order a bag of it for take out.\n\nWe were both getting a bit stuffed, but we gave in and ordered the Spicy Tuna Crackers for our last dish.  The crispy tempura nori crackers had just the right kick with wasabi and was topped with ahi tuna poke. This dish was $6.50 for five crackers and munching on these with a nice cold Kirin the next time I visit.\n\nWe had also ordered a pitcher of the 808 White Peach Sakeria to wash things down. It was refreshing and delicious!  It certainly opened my eyes and palate up to new creations and ways to enjoy drinking sake.\n\nWe didn't have room for dessert, however, the banana & apple fritters served with ice cream and fresh fruits looked absolutely mouth watering at the table next to us. I will leave room to experience this when I return next month to town for business.\n\nI believe this place will be a gem for the Summerlin community and will quickly fill its small capacity as word circulates amongst foodies who possess the palate to identify both quality and value.  The majority of the dishes are priced between $4 to $10."
0,Nice rooms and exceptional service but the the valet wait is beyond terrifying.  And they only have valet parking!  They dont have any system here and all scramble mode.  Waited over an hour to get my car when checking out.  Pls avoid rush hours!!!
0,"I don't know man. My dude and I came in here for some drinks before our reservation over at Herbs & Rye and as soon as I walked in I had a bad vibe. I thought the bartender was friendly but the crowd was pretty shifty.  A random guy came over and just started bragging about his job and the people he worked with.  A woman from across the bar kept looking over at me, even after I gave her a good stare down. \nThe best part was that 2 beers and 2 shots of Jameson came in under $10-15. \n \n I like my drinks cheap and this place did that for me, but I also like to be comfortable in my surroundings.  Not sure if I'd come back."
1,The food here is so damn good.  The bacon jam is good on almost anything.  The sliders have so much flavor.  The donut bread-pudding was sinfully delicious.  You meet cool people here.  It doesn't appear to seat a lot so I recommend a reservation for weekends.  I wish they had a bigger menu because the flavors are WOW.
1,"Byron, at Best Water Treatment installed and services our water filtering system. It's so refreshing to find a competent and honest tradesman. His work is excellent and his price is very reasonable. We highly recommend him."
1,"I wasn't sure to expect as this is my very first Kimpton experience ever. I've always heard good things, but I'm a bit of a snob and let's face it, I don't like being out in the middle of the desert. I mean, what is out here other than cacti and tacky Southwestern decor?\n\nWell, let me tell you I was all wrong. \n\nTaggia is great Italian out in the desert. We ate poolside for lunch today and it's been a while since I've felt so glamorous. \n\nThe bread is crusty and delicious. Everything that rustic Italian should be. I drenched the green olive bread in olive oil with a little salt and pepper. OoooooOOOhh. I think that was, uh, 6 slices that I downed.\n\nThe prosciutto crudo was ordered with a side salad instead of fries. It came out and I got looks of envy from my workmates who ordered the pizza or salad or turkey sandwich. *snore*\n\nI haven't seen this much prosciutto on a sandwich outside of my home in a long while and the mozzarella was plentiful and fresh with just a drizzle of olive oil. MMMMmmhhmmm.\n\nI don't think that people normally yelp side salads because really it's just a side. But there was an artful simplicity to this side of greens lightly tossed in a vinaigrette with julienned red onions on top. So pretty and so perfect with the sandwich. \n\nI couldn't have done it better myself.\n................................................................................................................\n2 October 2007\n\nWe had a \""working lunch\"" at Taggia. My branch chief and director both ordered my prosciutto crudo. I felt like the most popular intern there.\n\nI wanted another side salad so I went for the tuna sandwich which is tons more elegant than the average school yard version.\n\nWhole chunks of moist tuna with olive oil and sea salt with halved cherry tomatoes that were white, yellow, and orange. How chic!\n\nIt turns out that the chef at Taggia abhors cream and mayo (holla!) and refuses to mayo up sandwiches and drown pasta in cream sauce."
1,"After failed efforts to find a decent late dinner menu, I found this plush but reasonable spot on the strip and sat at the bar.  Knowledgeable, efficient bartender and quality American beef (devoured the prime rib) made me want to return.  Extensive selection of wines by the glass is also fantastic with great bang for the buck. \n\nThis place has value."
0,"Based on the Szechwan Chicken and the Spicy Chicken dishes two stars seems about right.\n\nThe menu here states that the spicy chicken would be in a bean sauce but we received it in approximately eighty percent sriracha sauce and the rest was mostly oil. This was the better dish.\n\nThe Szechwan Chicken I couldn't eat because it was extremely sweet and could have passed for a dessert sauce.\n\nBoth meals were made with nicely cooked white meat chicken. The vegetables in both dishes were bell peppers, onions and mushrooms that were a good ratio. They gave us two plates of white rice that were approximately three cups each.\n\nMaybe other dishes on the menu are better I don't know.\n\nThis place is very casual you order at the counter and seat yourself.\n\nI do note this place is very clean and spotless."
0,"One word- HORRIFIC! Where do I even begin??? Ok, here goes nothing....\n\nI stopped in Las Vegas for two days on my road trip across the country and excalibur had such a good rate I thought it was a no-brainer to book here. It's a pretty well-known name and I always thought it looked cool... until I checked in. The room is pretty spacious, room is BEYOND out-dated! I mean, my parents have furniture from the 80's that can put this furniture to shame! The carpet, covers and upholstery looks like it's from the medieval times themselves!! Despite all this, I was still just happy to be out of the car and in Vegas... until I turned down the blanket. God only knows what kind of fluids left those stains! I was absolutely horrified so I went downstairs and asked to change rooms or pay to upgrade to a better room. The guy behond the desk then rambled on this paragraph that I'm sure he has to say 100 times a night about how we can't change rooms tonight and when I asked if we could upgrade our second night in advance, he wouldn't let me do that either. I then asked him for fresh linens so I can atleast TRY to sleep on this disgusting bed and he looked at me like I was stupid and told me he \""I can't just GIVE you sheets\"". I fled the scene before I strangled the man, walked the mile to where I had to park my car, dug my pillow and throw blanket out of the bottom of my trunk and sucked it up. Needless to say, I will never be staying here again, nor will I be giving them any of my business!\n\nTotal list of disgusting features:\nPeeling wall paper, stained wall paper, stained blankets, hairs in my bed and on my pillow, loud ac/heater, broken bathroom appliances, nasty mildew-filled shower floor, broken chairs, NO internet like they said would be here, LOUD rooms, and theres only 1 lock so housekeeping can enter at all times, you can't chain it.\n\nAll in all, a pretty horrible experience."
0,"I was disappointed many times over with this place, but let me tell you first about the one thing I did enjoy. The chocolate filled croissant. It was very flaky, buttery, and good (however Fresh & Easy makes some in their bakery too which is cheaper and just as good).\n\nI ordered the Croque Madame and asked for no tomato due to an allergy. I was told that the food was pre packaged (I assume she may have meant pre made) and that I would need to remove it myself. My friend ordered a burger. We grabbed our water glasses, found a table, and started to share the croissant.\n\nWe waited for more than 20 minutes for our food to be brought to our table and upon arrival it looked very unappetizing and possibly even pre packaged like promised. My friends burger was over cooked and the potato salad he got was reported to me as being 'just okay'.\n\nMy Croque Madame (toast, tomato, cheese, and a fried egg on top) was not good at all. The bread tasted like it had been frozen and then put into a toaster (you know how the edges get super crunchy, but the middle is soggy... it was like that). Trying to get the tomato out became such a chore because of this that I eventually gave up. The egg on top was cooked well, but for as simple as the meal is, I do not understand why 1.) you would have is pre packaged or pre made at all, and 2.) why it takes over 20 minutes to have it ready. Even which my friend ordering a burger, 20 minutes is excessive.\n\nStay away from the caf\u00e9, but the bakery seems to be alright."
0,"Not impressed.  My out-of-town friend and I were strolling in the Paris hotel when we got an urge for cr\u00eapes....saw La Creperie and decided to check it out.  First, we were the only ones ordering cr\u00eapes.  No excuses for poor or slow service, right?  Second, le monsieur at the window must have been having an off day because he didn't smile at all.  I have heard from reputable sources that French ppl are not the most gregarious of folk, but sheesh.  Would it kill ya to smile?  Third, our Napolean (lemon curd/berry) cr\u00eapes needed more curd.  There was only a teaspoon or so of the curd which translates to too many naked, dry cr\u00e9pe bites.  Perhaps I should try the savoury cr\u00eapes to compare? \n\nOur cr\u00eapes took longer than I thought to make, given the fact that there was no one else ordering anything.  Will I return?  Probably not.  H\u00e9las.  Le sigh."
0,"Where do I start!! I got a great deal on groupon\nSo I was really excited. I did read some reviews after I had booked. But I didn't pay much attention I thought I give it a try. I thought how bad can it be! \nIt was the worst experience ever!!!! Let me just say the lobby was nice it looked clean front desk was really nice. So I so happy and couldn't wait to go in room since I booked the suit with jacuzzi in my room. First thing I noticed as I left the lobby there was no Parking it was packed! I Eventually found a spot after 10min I get up to my room and I noticed the floors seemed dirty like no one moped then I start to feel all the dust up my nose. As I walking around the living room and upstairs to the room I notice the rug was dirty ass f*** toe nails ,Bobbie pins ,chips, screw nails lol I kinds of stuff and did I mention bugs!!!! I was so mad I called housekeeping and the lady was so mad when I pointed everything out! She told me she was tired of this lol then I told her there was no hand soap or bar she got even more mad! And said I don't have any. I asked her for two more towels she replied what for? I said well I need extras and she told me no I need to put them in other rooms. By this point I had enough once she left my room I went to target bought bleach and bleach my tub and jacuzzi!!! That's just the room! Then there is Street bombs living in the back of the hotel!!!! And smoking pot and who knows what! I was checking and checking on my car the hole night. And to top the cherry on top there airport plans pass like every 5seconds and that's all u hear all day and night so loud there is no relaxing! I do not recommend this place at all!!!!! This is horrible also btw!!!! I got bed bug bits!!!! On my feet  and legs I'm so serious guys!!!!!!!! I'm never going back even if it was free for life!!!! Never !!!!!!!!!"
0,"The food is horrible, very greasy and expensive! You are better off going to 5 guys  burger,"
0,"Terrible service.  We were stuck with them on a home sale, and as we were living out of town, we had to do the signing remotely.  The notary they found cost $170, while I was able to find a mobile notary for $65.  Also, they sent a UPS label with afternoon delivery, rather than morning, which delayed the funding by an additional day.  They simply don't act like they care about their customers, so I'd never choose to use them again."
1,"Reading the bad reviews for Zumanity made me want to right a great review.  I would gladly go see this show again, even though I know everything that will happen.  We went on our honeymoon and that show was a ridiculous amount of fun!  The performers are also extremely gracious.\n\nIf you are offended by tits, dildos, huge packages, fake fabric penises, etc.--just don't go.  Of COURSE there was crude humor.  It was raunchy!  AND FUN!\n\nThe costumes were great, the humor kept us laughing, and the acts were great!  Props to the fishbowl girls who didn't bust their faces open on the glass.  I was literally terrified that they would!  But Cirque du Soleil performers are amazeballs--end of story.\n\nGo.  It's not a waste of money.  If you don't believe me, buy from the half-price ticket booth set up near New York New York."
1,"I just moved to this walkable neighborhood, and am attempting to get off my lazy butt and walk around more. Copper Star is only 5 minutes away from me so I walked on over today. \n\nAs a former Slavebux employee, I loved the nice, laid-back vibe. It's small but has a nice variety of seating and a little patio. I also loved the variety of people I saw- the place is very accepting of PDA by same sex couples, for example. Definitely a hipster vibe without being too overly pretentious.\n\nI tried a Cubano, which I hadn't had before. Definitely worth a try- it's espresso pulled with cinnamon and raw sugar, condensed milk, and steamed milk. \n\nI see some reviews about the poor wifi. I dunno if that is still a problem but I have to say when the wifi went out at the 'bux there was really nothing we as the employees could do except call the cable company- yet me and the other baristas got bitched at nonstop. So I know it sucks but have some patience.\n\nAt any rate, I will be back just because it is a perfect walking distance destination for my study/coffee sessions."
1,"I love all the colors and great atmosphere at this hostel.  As a frequent hosteler, I can say the accommodations are better than standard, with legitimately comfy beds.  The hostel isn't too large, so it feels welcoming and it is easy to meet people.\n\nI have stayed here often, and it almost felt like I was home the last time I was there."
1,"I rarely give a restaurant 5 stars, but being from the midwest, and being used to the mediocre sushi the midwest parces out, I must say, this was the BEST sushi experience I have had thus far.  \nI went with a large group and we ordered one of just about everything on the menu and split the final cost.  Great for groups; it was like an upscale buffet with all of our options!\nMood (or mod?) lighting, chic low tables and interesting decor created a modern, fusion style aura.  \nOur server was very knowledgeable about the menu items and described them well.  He was charming, too, which always helps!\nOf all food ordered, I appreciated the raw bar sampler; I would definitely recommend that to anyone who likes sashimi.  \nAs for maki, I really liked the dante roll--it's hot! but very tasty, and the viper roll.  I am a sucker for hamachi, and it was very fresh.  \nFor dessert, we ordered 8 spoons--and the dessert sampler. It was a lovely end to the meal. Very creative desserts. \nI would go  back in a second. Too bad I don't live in Mad-town... I might be their best customer."

1,SIT AT THE BAR!! Fair mixture on drinks (not watered or soda'd down) and good music (at the bar). Of course the food is tastey.
0,"This place is an embarrassment to mexican restaurants. The food here is terrible! Here's what we ordered:\nCombo taco/enchilada / oily taco, diarrhea enchilada \nGreen chilie burrito / the tortilla was plastic and the filling was gross.\nTaco salad / bunch of stuff with zero taste. Should have grazed in the planter.\nThe beans and rice? Really? They couldn't even get that right. Under cooked bland rice and under cooked beans.\nThis place sux!\nBeer is good."
1,"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  It is completely awesome to have another Indian option in this particular part of town.  Service was awesome.  Went straight in, place my order after talking to the staff about the vegan options (THIS IS A MUST) and immediately got my food.\n\nBEST thing about this place is price value.  You can get an appropriately sized serving and the price is outstanding.  I look forward to returning!"
0,"Haven't been back since, and don't really plan on going. However, I just happened to be sifting through my reviews and decided based on the two times I've been here, it really deserves 2 stars instead of 3. Being disappointed with the food and having to pay a lot doesn't really deserve an \""A-OK\"" rating."
1,"I really like this place a lot.  The employees seem to really care and every time I leave with a spotless car.  Nice, friendly people and the prices are right.  Can't really ask for more.  Very satisfied customer."
0,Apparently you cannot order the traveler through the drive-through even though it does not state that anywhere on the menu and if you go inside to order the traveler the clerks get upset and sigh as though your an inconvenience to them.  No customer service.
1,"Ginormous Borders at this location & tons of good stuff to tempt you \n\nHad finished my only book while in Charlotte for the week on business so I knew I'd need something to hold me over till I got back home to SF. \n\nLuckily, I was seeing a movie at Regal Cinemas & this Borders is right beside the theater - score! \n\nThey had all the Best Sellers; recommended authors; huge selection of science fiction / fantasy so I grabbed the newest Guillermo del Toro vampire book.....found a copy of World War Z and the book from the movie \""Let The Right One In\"" \n\nAfter all, it was Halloween & vampires & zombies were more than appropriate! \n\nStaff was super-nice! 1 lady was singing & walking around the store helping customers & the person who rang up my purchase ever-so-kindly voided my original purchase when I remembered my Borders Club info too late.....never an eye roll or even a smirk. She happily assigned my Club info to my purchase & I was off on my merry little way!"
0,"This is a very overpriced retail store and shooting range.  I recommend you do not purchase anything here until you call American Shooters and the gun Store first to check prices. I try to support my local retailers, but they are charging 3-4 times more than their online competitors.  Even though they have a fairly large selection the store is dirty, unorganized, and the staff needs a serious lesson in customer service.  If you are looking to purchase I recommend American Shooters, and if you are interested in renting and shooting full auto try The Gun Store."
1,"I ordered chicken chow fun for dinner today. Relatively authenic Cantonese dish. It's a little more gravy-ish and saltier than I was expecting but overall delicious. Tender chicken and good portion size. It's a little pricey but I figured it's the Midwest. I didn't see hong kong style milk tea on the menu - so sad, oh well. It's much better than hong kong wok!"
1,I booked this place through priceline during the heart of spring training season and the prices were reasonable (less than $150/night).  The hotel reflects local architecture with cacti everywhere.  The room was more than adequate for our 3 night stay.  We stayed at one end of the hotel so walking to the main lobby area did get a bit annoying but our room's location was very quiet and peaceful.  We used both pools/jacuzzi's - very nice and not that crowded.  The coffee bar was great for morning breakfasts.  The location was very convenient - only a few minutes drive to the fashion mall.  Very good value!
1,"Well, one reviewer said that if I'm used to dining on NY or SF, this place won't blow my mind.  Maybe they didn't eat what we did.\n\nGranted, two of the four things we ordered were specials: a lovely capon rillette appetizer, and a top sirloin (slow cooked in a sealed bag with herbs for four hours, and it shows!) entree.  That appetizer was incredible, the top sirloin was delectable and from Australia, just like my date, and the salmon I ordered absolutely melted in my mouth, just like my d... err... anyway!  My warm goat cheese salad was amazing with plenty, if not too much cracked pepper on top.  I asked our waiter to bring lots of pepper, and being a total character from Chicago, he more than obliged.  I think he went a little overboard, yet otherwise, he was a really fantastic waiter, and I did find it hilarious, if not just a touch too spicy.  Delicious though!  He also chose us a very lovely wine to go with our meal, was a great conversationalist, and brought us tiny cookies from their pastry chef, who is diabetic, just like my date!  No kidding.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the menu comes wrapped around your napkin, and they will fold your napkin for you if they come by when you've momentarily left the table?  They are SO attentive: truly excellent service.\n\nOverall, a lovely dining experience, and I look forward to checking out the others here in CA once I finally drag my classy butt up to the wine country."
1,"Mama Pop taste in the middle of a shopping mall.  Doesn't get any better than this!!  \n\nWith tons of eats in Miracle Mile and even inside Planet Hollywood, I'm amazed on how often my food choice out here comes down to D' Amore's Famous Pizza.  Let's get somethings straight, I don't eat pizza often.  And when I do, I am often disappointed. D' Amore's has been there for me, especially past midnight when almost everything in here is closed.  \n\nStaff is amazing.  Not one Associate ever forgets to greet you.  You can tell that at this establishment customer service is their priority.  \n\nNow for their pizza.  Some people have their preferences like Chicago deep dish or NY style thin crust.  I am a deep dish fan myself, but find D'Amore's thin crust a great change of pace. Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Domino's, and the rest of the commercialized joints don't even compare.  The pizza is greasy like it should be, but you can still taste all the ingredients. Never too saucy, which is my preference. After a few bites, you'll forget that you're even in a mall.  You'll feel like you're in that Mama Pop hole in the wall type pizzeria.  That's how it should be.\n\nWhether it's a long day shopping the mall, partying with friends at the bar or losing a grip at Planet Hollywood, I at least know that I have one consistent...a stop at D' Amore's before I head home."
0,"I agree with most of the other reviews about this place.  The food is ok at best and the service is a complete cluster fuq.  The value of the food is ok because they give you a decent amount for the price.  It is all just a bit dry and bland.  The service is very helpful and apologetic when something goes wrong, but it really doesn't help because everything was slow.  You almost feel bad because they are very nice, but really don't know what is going on.\n\nThe absolute best part of going here was that the establishment was an old 5 & Diner that went out of business.  It was a trip seeing all of the 5 & Diner decor but now with Mediterranean music being played in the background and people eating hummus at the milk shake counter.\n\nAll-in-all I'm glad I went there to try it out, but probably won't go back."
0,"This show was all over the place except in bad, which it almost stayed at throughout. I've seen better looking and just better dancers at other shows. I only enjoyed one segment (Josh sings with a girl in green), the rest were just poor adolescent excuses disguised as ideas for the show. Josh, one of the lead singers, has a great voice and can really sing. Hard to not like him, but he is mostly wasted in this show. Holly is barely in the first half of the show and I was a bit surprised that she still seems stiff on stage like its her first performance. Frankly if you just want to see her boobs, which is the big and very brief ending,  you are better off just looking her up on the internet. \n\nIf you really want a sensual experience go see Zumanity. If you want to see hot women dance go to a strip club. You'll get far more for your money and entertainment then here. I think if you are drunk it might be 3 stars-like really drunk and high too, yeah you should definitely be high. Thank god I only paid half price."
1,"One of the best pedicures I have ever had! My nails are beautiful, really appreciated that Don made a suggestion and showed me what it would look like before putting on my nails. Only slight irritation was that I made appointment but I still waited 30 minutes. Because everything was great, I am able to over look that."
0,"My fiancee and I have dined at Donovan's just a couple of times. The first, a few years ago for a late afternoon bite and a Happy Hour drink. We were disappointed by the (all-male) serice staff who were stuffy and borderline rude. We felt this was as a result of not ordering expensive wine or steaks. The dark wood and white tablecloths along with valet service made us feel special and important but the quality of service had the opposite effect. Recently, some friends of ours encouraged us to give the place another try as there has been a change of hands in onwership or something. Sadly, no real changes were noticable. If anything, the experience was worse! Though there are now female servers, the quality of food has decreased (our side of potatoes was served cold and my steak was overdone) and management seemed disinterested in our displeasure. As a matter of fact, the female manager on staff in a tight fitting business suit could not be courteous enough to stop by our table even after we requested her to do so. We will definitely NOT be back this time."
1,Nice decor. Very modern. Only trouble is the pool does not ave an adults only pool. Other than that a nice hotel and resort. I would say this hotel s on par with Palazzo.
0,"If I could give it no stars I would. The drinks were watered down, the staff was rude, especially the people checking your IDs. All the guys were on power trips. Dude...you work the line at a club. You're not Secret Service. The only reason 1 star is even deserved is because the DJ was amazing. Don't waste your time here if you want to have good service and not be shoulder to shoulder 24/7. Way too much of a not-so-good time. Go to Marquee where it's worth it."
0,I haven't  eaten here in months due to bad experiences in the past and what a waste my phone in order was wrong as always. People avoid this place they have mediocre food and customer service is terrible!
0,"Oh I came to this place I was walking down street. They had a temporary menu which had some misspelled words on it.. OMG... I was so expecting this place to be MUCH MUCH better.. I was told the owner \""big mama\""  was on a much needed vaction. So someone else was cooking ,and trust me from what I ordered, you can clearly tell somethings missing.. I also should have known something was going to be wrong when I saw on the temporary menu w/ misspelled words.. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich w/ baked beans... Both were HORRIBLE.. It was a complete waste of money.. I don't think I would ever eat here again when I visit Pittsburgh.. And I really wanted this place to be good.. but they need to STEP IT UP A COUPLE OF NOTCHES."
0,"Wow, even with low expectations, this place was awful.  There was over an hour wait, the waiting area was hot, and the food was actually bad.  Not just \""not good\"" - it was bad.  We choked down some pasta and left asap.  Even with a Groupon, we felt like it was a bad decision."
1,"A great hidden gem off Mill Ave!  This place has good veg/non veg healthy lunch options in a small court yard setting.  For ~$7 you will be full.  There popular chicken salad is delicious and you can't go wrong with any of their items.  I dig the free chips/salsa as well and the out door seating is good 9 out 12 months a year.  The owners and employees make this a warm friendly environment.  Styrofoam cups at a \""green\"" restaurant is what drops them from 5 to 4 stars."
1,"Hubby found this place on yelp and wanted to check it out, since he's a huge beer snob.  We were impressed upon entering the establishment: very high ceiling, a trendy warehouse feel to the bar, and unpretentious bar staff.  Hubby had the Nogne O, which he quickly proclaimed to be the best beer he has ever drank.  I am not a beer drinker, but greatly enjoyed my ahi tuna sandwich (the wasabi mayo was lovely!).  I WANTED to try the deep fried oreos (what? what??), but I was too stuffed from my sandwich, piggie that I am.\n\nI'm giving this place 4* because of the cig smoke.  Yes, yes, I KNOW that casinos are allowed to have smoke -- and Aces and Ales has a few electronic gambling machines -- but the smoke really bugs me.  Before all you smoky types tell me not to go to places with smoke, I will say: I normally avoid smoky places!  I wanted to support my hubby's fledgling yelp search and check out Aces.  We won't be back for a while, partly because of the smoke, but mainly because of how far it is from home (we live in the NW part of town, aka California....ha).  \n\nVery impressed with the nice gal behind the bar.  :)"
0,"Ambiance is good and on the surface you expect to have a better than average burger given the price and the upscale feel of the place.  \n\nI've been there twice, and coincidentally the same things have happened both times:\n\nThe cashier didn't know how to input a make your own burger, with chili, egg, and grilled onions (even though everything is on their list of ingredients to make your own)\n\nThe cook forgot my chili\n\nThey were out of silverware\n\nI asked for a side of mayo which they forgot.\n\nThe most recent time, the burger and flavor of the meat was good, but it was a sloppy mess.  The 1/2 lb. patty dwarfed the bun, which was rendered useless.  When I did finally find the lower half of the bun it was a soggy and greasy.\n\nMy fries were cold and underdone.\n\nSomething seemed off too, as if the kitchen was short-staffed or inexperienced, as I saw orders going back and the food runners seemed confused.\n\nI still *may* go back but I'd rather go to in-n-out like others have pointed out (not Five Guys though, I'd still rather have this than any food from that pit)."
1,"JJ's is the best! Took us awhile to discover but worth it. \nTheir food is great, especially for the price, and the service is awesome. \nNeighborhood type of place. Great atmosphere. \n\nThe Enchalida Stlye Buritto is the best. Get it with red aside, but be careful, HOT. \n\nWe go back often, because the food is so consistent."
1,"I don't care what anyone else says, this is by far the most beautiful shopping street I have ever seen. Yes, so on rainy/snowy days it's a bit annoying having to put your brolley up every time you venture out of one shop and into another, but where else can you have capital city quality shopping on one side of the street, and a huge big grassy park and views of the gorgeous Edinburgh Castle on the other?\n\nAlong the main street itself, you'll find all the usual big high street names like Gap, Topshop, Boots, Waterstones, The Body Shop etc and if it's a department store you're after ther's one at each at AND one in the middle (although Jenners is my favourite of the 3). \n\nThe best thing about Princes Street though, is that it's designed in blocks like in America. It's on these little streets that cut across it every 50 metres or so that all the functional/boring day-to-day things like banks, newsagents and estate agents are - which means there's more room along the Princes Street itself for the good stuff.\n\nThat said, there is one really, really, annoying thing about Princes Street (aside from the snow issues already mentioned): although it's lovely and beautiful with all the old Georgian and late Victorian architecture, it does mean that the shops are quite small and so most of the bigger ones have two or sometimes even three branches spread along this one street. The amount of times you'll be on autopilot and accidentally go to the wrong H&M for what you need, only to have to trudge what seems like a mile back along the road to the other branch, it's more than a bit of a pain."
0,"I had the soft pretzels and chorizo mac and cheese.  I was really looking forward to moist soft pretzels with some great cheese... the cheese was watery and was not enough for the very dry pretzel.  It really needed salt and butter to make it taste more than just plain bread, or much more cheese to dip it in.  The chorizo mac and cheese sounded delicious and like it would be somewhat spicy, but it was VERY bland.  When I added salt, it wasn't as bad... but it was still very meh.  Not remotely spicy or flavorful.\n\nFor the price (I spent 18 bucks on these two things), I've definitely had better.  Which bums me out, I've been wanting to try this place since they opened as their menu sounded delicious, with many things that I thought I would love.\n\nHappy hour prices were meh.  5 dollar margaritas, 3.75 well, which are comparable or more expensive than any other bar in the area.  Not really worth my time again, and glad I didn't take my boyfriend as he would have likely complained about paying for that.\n\nDid not try the breakfast... which is what everyone seems to be raving about.  If you're going, try it for that but skip the dinner menu for sure."
0,"Food is ok and boring. It is a part of the Darden chain of restaurants so if you are familiar with Red Lobster, think of a Caribbean inspired version and you have Bahama Breeze. The drinks are delicious and really bad for you, and the food always tastes exactly the same; consistency is good. I have actually eaten here a couple times, but my last experience will have me never come back.\n\nIf you are looking for mediocre food in the array of mediocre food options near corporate Hughes center you could wind up here. Maybe you have coupons and you purposefully drove here? Understood.\n\nMy final visit to Bahama Breeze began with 2 coworkers and I walking in and standing in front of a host podium without being acknowledged. Three professional ladies, standing in an empty entrance waiting to be seated, until a couple minutes later a host (who never lifted her head from staring at the floor, I must have missed the carpet design) finally sat us. We were helped by a strangely hostile server who at one point through the meal had his manager come up to us and apologize for the wait for our food. This came as a surprise to us because he never mentioned anything about late food, and we hadn't asked about it. \n\nWhen our lunches arrived my baja fish tacos with a side salad had turned into baja fish tacos with a side soup. I enjoyed the soup and made no complaints, it was a tasty chowder with fried shrimp. Overall the food was unmemorable but not inedible. The service was terrible. I can't believe that every person I interacted with: host, server, and manager were not polite to outright rude. We were *told*(not offered) to get free dessert (or else our server said he would eat it? wtf?) but never received any apologies. Not for the late food, not for our shitty greet at the front door, not for our strangely hostile server, not for our late and incorrect food. Instead we got begged to take a free dessert. Sad. WTF guys, get your shit together."
0,"I'm staying at the omni hotel next door to this place and decided to give it a try.  I walked in and placed a to go order.  After waiting around outside for about 10 minutes, I came back in to see a bag waiting on the back of the greeter's station.  I nodded at the lady who took my order and she smiled back at me.  Then I sat at the bar - assuming the mystery back was some other lucky diner's property.  Three ladies and a man stood idly by at the greeter's station as I waited at the bar. The restless employees chatted, and hopped around looking alternatively interested in each other or just completely bored.  One, then two bartenders asked if I needed a drink.  I said \""no, I'm just waiting for a to go order,\""  as the girl who placed my order twisted her hair and batted eyelashes with a fellow employee.  After about 5 minutes of hair twisting, eyelash batting and what might have been the prologue scenes of a poorly acted porn, she looked at the bag behind her, pulled it from the shelf and examined the ticket.  Then she looked directly at me.  I hopped down from my barstool and came to get the bag: \""That's mine? Really?\""  \""Yes!\"" she said in a chipper voice, acting as if the kitchen was super quick.  \""Wow, because the four of you have just been sitting there chatting and having such a grand old time - I figured that bag had been waiting for someone else. It's been up there forever.\""  Stunned, her mouth was agape. I took the bag and looked at her sincerely: \""You're doing a great job!\""\n\nUgh.\n\nOn to the food: I had the ceviche cocktail which was properly cold and spiced nicely but a little oversauced. Raw jalapenos would be a nice addition, but with the volume of sauce you can't taste the seafood.\n\nMy to-go order was well-packaged and labeled - and included a generous portion of chips & salsa.  The chips were \""so so\"" regular fare: nothing special - not thin, but not too thick. They could easily be a bulk food purchase. I'd be surprised if they were house made.  The plasticware included one bunched up undersized napkin and exactly one salt and pepper packet - just like your average airline.  Two sets were oddly included in the bag.\n\nWhile the ceviche was at a reasonable temperature, the Chicken Tinga was not.  The over-easy egg atop the chicken was a congealed mess by the time I opened the container and the rice was tepid.  Again - the sauce was everywhere.  Nice flavor but EVERYWHERE.  I didn't know chicken could swim.  The 4-5 presliced pieces of chicken breast were drowning in a lovely and flavorful sauce.  It was like eating one of those frozen nuke meals with slightly nicer spices. Chicken Tenga is usually done with shredded chicken - much like carnitas.\n\nThe rice was cold and flavorless as was the grill-marked flour tortilla served with the meal.\n\nThis might be a hip and trendy atmosphere and a nice bar, but the food and service leave a lot to be desired.\n\nI would have rated only one star, but just the idea of some of the food items - even if poorly executed - is worthy of an extra.  Good luck on the porno-bound service staff.  It will be a sweet trick if this lasts more than a year."
1,"I have never eaten dinner here but their brunch is off the chain! it's $15 all you can eat and includes a breakfast beverage of your choice. I'd choose the frozen mimosa! The mac and cheese is sooooo cheesy and creamy! I love that you can also have bagel,lox,and cream cheese and they have onions,capers,eggs,and tomatoes to add to the breakfast sandwich. They also have the usual-bacon,eggs,sausage,eggs benedict,waffles. I love coming here for brunch!"
0,"Fried rice had no egg. Egg rolls were soggy with little filling. They forgot my white rice with my meal. Take out comes in plastic, not white cardboard. Closest Chinese to us, but we will not be returning."
1,"I love this place.  They are so friendly and helpful, and that is a rarity for a bike shop.  \n\nJust this Saturday, I was using their pump in front of their place to blow my tires up (because I'm too lazy to carry my own pump down to the street and then back up again... I know) when I accidentally snapped the valve because I wasn't paying enough attention.  This ruined the tube, of course, so I went in to buy a tube and a tire lever.  \n\nNow, if you've read my other reviews of bike shops, you might know that I can get a little defensive and grouchy when the bike shop people treat me like an idiot.  I think this is justified.  So when I forgot the name of the tire lever and described it in what might have been the most idiotic possible fashion, I really really appreciated that the woman who was helping me wasn't condescending, quickly figured out that I was going to change the tube myself, offered me their tools so I didn't have to buy my own, happily sold me what I wanted, and then, when I asked for a paper towel, offered me use of their sink and degreaser.\n\nThumbs up for JR."
0,"Walked in, stood for 5 to 7 full min wanting to buy my daughter a bike for her bday and didn't get acknowledged once. I walked closer to the desk and still nothing. Looked like a great place but horrible service so just walked out."
1,I have eaten their lunch buffet once a week for several weeks now and think its the best Indian I've tasted in the Valley so far.
0,This place has been a joke everytime I've gone. I only go when friends go & everytime the worst experience ever. You get poor service on all fronts.
1,Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):\n8 Food\n7 Service\n8 Atmosphere\n8 Value\n\nOnly one caveat to the excellent scores above:  Do not get the eggs benedict.  Everything else I've had is great though.
1,"First let me just say, if you are dining on the cheap, this is NOT the place for you.  Average steak is $40+ and the bone in Rib Eye was $65.  So we were not dining on the cheap but still, if it says Market Price and you don't ask, then just like us fools, it's your bad...did not realize the Seafood Plateau was going to be $165.00; granted the crab legs were large, and it had a couple of snow claws, but the rest was just regular cold shrimp (like 4) and oysters on the half, maybe another 4. It was enough to share, and I guess you pay a premium for fresh fish when you are in the middle of the dessert...or well, anyway just ask.\n\nThe thing to come to Del Frisco's for is the meat.  They have great meat and they season and cook it well.  As well or as rare as you want it, that's how you are going to get it.  The sides are served family style and there is plenty to share, once you agree on what to share (I love creamed spinach, but I was the only one at the table to love creamed spinach, so I got some anyway!).  \n\nThe ambience is dark steakhouse, and the servers are professionally friendly.  They have an excellent wine list and their som is more then happy to help you find something to fit your meal and your pocket book.\n\nLindySez:  All in all a great meal...just remember to ask the prices so you don't get sticker shock at checkout!"
0,"Service is ungodly slow. They messed up my sushi order. Kitchen order came towards the end of the meal. Appetizer order came at the very end of the meal. This place is dead on a Friday night, should have no excuse. I have no idea why the reviews are so good. If you're in no hurry and want mediocre \""sushi\"" at best with some flavorless calamari for dessert, this is the place for you. My 2nd star is for refilling my water and bringing the bill out faster than everything else."
0,OMG... Why is every local Chinese place completely greasy & disgusting....EXCEPT   for the Panda on Rainbow near the Best Buy/ Home Depot?? I just can't get a decent meal!! \n\nGive me a Pei Wei!!! Give me a Pick up Stix. Please. :(
0,"BBQ burger was ok at best. Nothing spectacular. Everything seems overpriced. They offer a burger and frozen hot chocolate at $25, so that's what I got, considering I was only coming just for the frozen hot chocolate and a regular size is $11. I also was able to try the steak sandwich, which was amazing but super messy and difficult to eat as a sandwich. Service was mediocre even though the restaurant wasn't busy. But the frozen Oreo hit chocolate was absolutely to die for!! All in all, come here just for the frozen hot chocolate. Don't waste your money on the food."
1,Ah-mazing! My only complaint is that my boyfriend and I were running late to see a show so we had to rush though dinner a bit. The food was absolutely wonderful. We ordered both of the bento boxes which really is a little bit of everything off the menu so I would recommend doing that. The green curry with shrimp was one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted.  After we finished the shrimp I was eating the sauce like a soup.  Sooo good. The dim sum was particularly good as well.  As I mentioned before we were in a rush so we didn't order dessert but if their dessert is anything like their dinner I'm sure you are in for a treat. Highly recommended!
0,"We arrived at the restaurant during early evening on a Thursday.  There were only two other customers at the time sitting at a corner table.  The female at that table was having an extrememly loud cell phone conversation that we were not interested in. We stood at the entrance for a minute. No one greeted us.  Two Asian males were just sitting at the bar chatting, not paying attention to us.  One had an apron on with the nametag \""BAI\"".  The other one just read a newspaper at the bar.  So I began to walk over and get a menu from the shelf at the rear of the the two males.  \n\nI was interested in some spicy Szechuan cuisine. The other two in my party wanted something not so spicy.  The female in our group asked if everything was spicy.  Bai finally interupted us and stated with a sarcastic glare, \""the one with the chili (icon) is hot!\""\n\nWe agreed to eat here and told Bai that there were three of us dining.  Bai immediately attempted to sit us at a small table adjacent to the the loud lady on the cell phone.  I gestured to the larger table and Bai asked,\"" how many?\""  We said, \""Three\"".  Bai gestured us away from the larger round table, towards the smaller table adjacent to the loud female on the cell phone again.  Bai stated,\""you have three, three sit here!\""\n\nThere were maybe 30-40 EMPTY tables in the entire restaurant and he refused to have us sit anywhere but near the loud lady.  We finally told him that we would like the larger table to make room for the many dishes we were going to try.\n\nBai became disgruntled and we sat at the larger table.  As we were looking at the menu items, I noticed that Bai had walked towards the bar and muttered something to his Asian friend\n reading the newspaper.  Bai then turned around and glared at us.\n\nI finally had had it and decided that a sour attitude would probably be present during the entire meal.  I wish I had read the YELPS on this restaurant prior to considering it.\n\nI stood up and stated to my friends that it would be of best interest if we departed now since we felt uncomfortable by the ungracious staff.\n\nI should have also noticed that no one was breaking the door down attempting to dine in this awful place.\n\nAll three of us are Asian, so I don't think there was any unpleasantries due to race.\n\nWe ended up next door at the Capitol Seafood Restaurant where we were pleasantly greeted and respected during the entire meal.  We were even given free desserts, which no one else received that we noticed.\n\nWe should have waved a $100 bill at Bai as we passed leaving the area, because that is what he lost his restaurant that evening, not to mention this AWESOME review."
0,I made an appointment by coming in earlier in the week and was given a confirmation card. The front desk personnel said they would confirm the next day. I didn't get a phone call the next day and so I called. They confirmed the time ....I'm waiting now as I do this review they are already 15 minutes behind schedule and I came in 15 minutes before my scheduled time to do paperwork. While I sit here they already told another couple to return and offers free services to them because their person was running late. Sigh I really wanted the massage and as I talk to the front desk person she is unsure how long the personnel will take therefore I must leave....it's been 25 minutes. I do not recommend! Charlotte has several great places don't be fooled by the location of this company being in South Park (which is typically reliable) they unfortunately aren't.
0,"Didn't eat but was lured by an impressive Tequila lineup.  They had our favorite (Casa Nobles Anejo).  But the bartenders were pretty poor at mixing a good margarita.  I asked for a Grand Marnier float and he poured it in the shaker after the tequila.  The mixes they used were mediocre at best.  The drinks were  $14, similar ones would hit $18-$20 at the \""finer\"" bars.  Kind of sad to have really good tequila but not the bar talent, although given the appearance of the place as a basic taco joint, I didn't expect much."
1,First time seeing a Cirque show and this one just blew us away. The music from the headrest speakers and the ones in front of the seats were fantastic. There was so much to see in every part of the show. We highly recommend seeing this one if you want to give your visual and hearing senses a treat. Standing ovation!!!
1,Buying a house can be a very scary experience if you do not know the ins and outs. Tom makes the process easy to understand and during stressful times he makes the task of buying a home fun. Yes FUN!!!! Tom knows how to bring clarity and understanding to even the most confusing portions of the buying a home. He is a genuine and trustworthy guy. I will continue to refer him to anyone I know that needs his service with the trust that he will make their buying or selling of a home just as enjoyable! Thanks Tom!!
1,"The food was even better than I remembered, and as I was leaving, I thought to myself that I need to eat here at least once a month or more.  The flavors here are just top notch, and the staff is super friendly.  One really good mark of an Indian restaurant, is that Indian people eat there.  While I saw a mix of people in the place for the buffet this afternoon, I saw a healthy number of Indians there as well which made me feel like I was eating authentic cuisine.  Put it this way, how many chinese people do you see eating at PF Changs or Panda express?  The reason is because the food is made for a western palate.  At Madras, the food is all Indian all the time, and that is what is going to keep me coming back!  A great tip is that at the end of your meal when you are walking out, they have a bowl called Mukhwas, or basically \""mouth freshener.\""  The mix is cardamom, anise seed, and coconut candy, and one half spoon full in your hand that you put into your mouth really helps to sooth your stomach after the meal. So if you haven't gone yet, use this review as an absolute billboard to try their buffet, and come back for dinner."
1,"DC Auto has a great shop and its really clean! Great display showing what they offer and a nice waiting area with a tv. A huge plus is that they stick to their time estimate!!!  Everyone is nice and professional and they make you the priority when you're in there. I've tinted a lot of cars (about 14) over the last 10 years and have had some good and bad experiences. One thing that is great is the pricing is laid out on their site so there's no guessing or calling around to a bunch of stores only to get quoted different numbers depending on the time/day you call. Although, they do have some of the best pricing on their ceramic film. There's a reason they have 5 stars and nice to see reputable shops still exist.\nI recently tinted my commuter car (2015 Honda Fit) and went with ceramic on all windows and the clear nano on the windshield. Car was returned clean and will be bringing my SUV to get tinted."
1,NO 4G or LTE signal. I missed out on a lot of shopkicks. The available seating areas are hard as a rock. Made it real uncomfortable as I sat and waited as the girls did their shopping.  I felt like I was on punishment. And then no internet access! Minutes felt like hours!
1,Great atmosphere and friendly service. My fiance had the #2 and I had the fish Tacos. Food was great and it was nice to get away from the hipsters that infest old town Scottsdale.
1,"i've always loved this casino. i made my first amount of cash gambling here back in the day. I only came here to play some poker and their poker room is beautiful and spacious.  The managers in the room weren't the brightest, but they were friendly and were sort of on top of things.  You can tell right away that they get a lot of regulars in the room, so it made it exciting for some time."
0,"You now the first time I went to the Griddle, I was semi-pleased. It was the second and third time that got me fed up! For service: I have to say its a 50/50. They're service is very unproductive, they almost have no professionalism and knowledge to what the waitstaff need to say or do. The very first waitress that we had was very pleasant, but the second and third time sucked ass. We had to ask for this and that too many times. The food is also inconsistent, the third time I went I ordered \""Griddle combo or something like that\"". I asked for fruit instead of the house hash for $1. So when it came, it was incorrect and the portion size were so small. Here's an example, house hash, mushrooms,spinach, onions, and chicken. Portions came out in that order and there was literally 4 pieces of chicken that were the size of croutons . Pathetic! For $10.   VERY OVERRATED. Just order pancakes and that's it, otherwise you will be disappointed."
1,"Attention Charlotte Restaurant-Goers, Pollos Mario is a hidden gem!\n\nThe restaurant is Colombian, with some dishes from other Latin American countries.  Colombian food is tasty, not heavy or spicy like Mexican food, but balanced.  Their specialities include char-grilled meats, fried and sweet plantains, and fruit shakes (mango, pineapple, guava, etc).  \n\nOne dinner, consisting of a meat, rice and beans, plantains and a side salad is less than $10!  The service is high-quality; the wait staff and owners are friendly and attentive.  The restaurant is clean.  Restaurants on Albermarle Rd tend to carry the stigma of that side of town, but you won't be dissapointed.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, try the beef tongue or Postobon soda."
1,Best place to get a pedicure! The staff is so friendly and does a awesome job every time!
1,"**Scam alert: the loose organic spinach that they sell for $6.99/lb is actually just the 1 lb tub right down the aisle that sells for $4.99/lb!! The employee filled it right in front of my face! WTF? Bad.**\n\nWow, what a store! This is probably the best WF I've ever been to. It's a drive from me, probably 12 miles or so, but it was so worth it. Also, Fabio. He walked right behind me and asked the produce guy who happened to be in front of me where the bathroom was. Don't hate! He was gorgeous! And that accent!\n\nOkay, sorry, where was I? I was in this WF and Fabio...never mind. The selection of vegetables, fish, etc. is exactly what you expect: fresh, vibrant and bursting with color. Every store pales in comparison to WF anyway, but this one is just magnificent! They have gelato, chocolate, cupcakes, bread, wine, beer, cheese...this is where I want to go when I die. WF HEAVEN. \n\nThe employees are awesome. They know where everything is and they are eager to help you find it. Lots of smiles. I was impressed, but AZ is a pretty friendly place anyway. This is just another place to find happy people. \n\nIt's expensive, but you know you're going to get the freshest, most high quality food around. I love this store!"
0,Firefly is closed and is  now Tex Tubbs Taco...thank god...
0,"The food here is pretty good but the service was some of the worst I've ever experienced. Our wait just to place drink orders was almost 15 minutes, had I not been exhausted from my drive in from Columbus I probably would have left then. However we stayed the waitress was slow, forgetful we had to yell for her or wave our arms if we needed anything. At one point the poor people next to us who had also received terrible Service were asked by the waitress a full 15 minutes after she placed their order if she had gotten their orders. I probably won't visit this location again on my next Pittsburgh trip."
1,"The views are amazing. Located right next to Heinz Field, and the Fort Duquesne and Veterans Bridges. Rooms are a bit small for the prices that they offer."
0,"We have dined at this restaurant in its former location several years ago so we pretty much knew the drill.  We shared orders of scallops and shrimp that also included udon noodles, Napa cabbage, onion, mushroom, broccoli, scallions and rice.  We cooked the seafood and veggies in a hot pot filled with seawater and then dipped each in either of two sauces which may be customized for one tastes by adding of chili sauce, daikon and/or garlic. The ingredients were uniformly fresh and the overall experience enjoyable, but the amount of seafood was ridiculously small in relation to the price"
0,"If I could leave 0 stars I would like that option . I love the hotel I go to Vegas quite often and encore is always my top pick for a stay. Unfortunately, I had my first bad experience due to the security . My friend and I used the bathroom then we were going to proceed to xs. But a head security manager made a call to stop my\nFriend and I for no reason whatsoever. There were 2 of them one I believe  was Robert and Jeff. They approached us asking for our IDS for no reason and didn't ask us why we there . We showed no signs of any illegal activity nor did we look the part . Jeff held our IDS and continued to bend them and they were  spelling our names to their manager . This took about a good\n10-15 mins . People began to notice and started calling us names due to the public humiliation . We spoke to lee who was the manager at the time and he basically showed no  remorse and said 2 comments \"" we wanna weed them out \"" and \"" do you want me to sugar coat it for you guys \"" . If this is the type of people you hire it can lead to a serious problem .  Due to what occurred outside the club we still proceeded to go to xs yet to find to our surprise men were harassing us inside the club thinking we were escorts . It was the worst feeling a woman can ever have and this needs to be resolved . I will take this further ."
1,This is a good and a a free show. Is it for kids not really but it's exciting and good. The best part it's free.
0,"Overall I don't really mind the cheesecake factory.  I just think that if you're looking for a nice place to eat there are MUCH better options that something attached to the South Park Mall.  \n\nThe wait is always atrocious and even when you do have reservations it's doubtful that you'll actually get seated on time.  The food is overpriced for the quality you are getting.  The waitstaff is nice but they are busy because the place is enormous.\n\nThe atmosphere is corny.  I can't think of any other way to describe it.\n\nDo yourself a favor and take a look around when you walk in there.  Stop being a stereotypical American and go eat at an independently owned shop.  My bet is you will be much happier, eat about 2,000 less calories, and get out the door for a heck of a lot cheaper!\n\nIf you really need a piece of cheesecake - get it to go."
0,"The food wasn't really authentic mexican. I didn't try the table side guacamole because it was extra, but I''m guessing it was probably better then the one that is cheaper. Worst guacamole ever, was it even real? Ceviche tasted like it was marinated with tabasco. Mahi Mahi tacos were okay, I've had better. The shrimp enchilada's hardly had any shrimp or anything inside of them but they were drenched in sour cream, yum. I mean if you are into that kind of fake mexican food you should be okay, but in all honesty you should really just go to cafe rio instead. However, the waitress was very sweet."
1,The good is great johnny is awesome.  My favorite is duck salad. All the food is goid there is a new bsr staff that makes sll the difference.
1,"Page's is a Pittsburgh icon. The ice cream is good, the selection is vast, and the price is right. They have so many different things to try, it's nearly impossible to choose. I'm a big fan of the cookie sundae, brownie sundae, and cinnamon roll sundae. The options at this place are pretty much endless. But sometimes a regular soft serve sugar cone is the way to go. It's better than Dairy Queen, AND you support a local business by going here. What more could you ask for. \n\nI don't know if I would say that Page's has particularly superior soft serve, but it's the experience and variety that makes this a four star place. I do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like Dairy Queen, but not by much. What makes Page's special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors. It's also the nostalgia that goes along with it. It's a business that hasn't changed much in it's lifetime, and that's what most people like about it. You can count on Page's to be there every March-October. They're going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.  It represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people. It means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop. \n\nFor those who have never been there, there is no interior so you'll have to eat in your car or standing outside. I prefer to open the back of my SUV, sit there and enjoy the night while I eat my ice cream. The parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes. I typically avoid this place on busy nights just for that reason. \n\nBeware, they only accept cash. But there is an ATM on site!"
0,"A great menu that isn't the standard cookie-cutter fajitas and burritos mexican menu.  A lot of very good choices.  The staff has the feel of a family run business with everyone very friendly.\n\nWe went to the North Scottsdale location and we must have caught them on an off night however.  The kitchen was backed up even though the restaurant was less than half full and it took 45minutes to get tacos and pollo con espinacas although people seated after us were getting their meals quickly.  When it came, the vegetables in the espinacas were still icy although the chicken was warm so i'm not sure the order everything was put together.  My water glass was cracked and even though I pointed it out early, it wasn't replaced.  \n\nOur waitress was very apologetic for the delay and the cracked glass, but no consideration was made on the bill and for a restaurant charging a premium, I expected more.  We probably won't go back."
0,"We got a to go order for alfredo and spaghetti. The amount of sauce they put in the food was a joke. It literally tasted like noodles with a hint of sauce. We couldn't even save our leftovers because there wasn't enough sauce to save the noodles from becoming dried out and crunchy in the microwave. When a place is charging $15 a plate for a basic pasta dish then they need to step it up a notch. Id love to think this was a one off situation but it's not. Oh, and if you try to ask for more sauce (ie, the normal portion) they'll try to charge you."
1,"I would highly recommend Angela Lalli to make you beautiful for any special occasion! I hired Angela to do hair for my November wedding in San Diego.  Not only did she do exactly what I wanted, she also made my entire bridal party (5 girls) and my mother look amazing.  I was extremely happy with the outcome of my hair and was truly impressed how she made each girl look unique, yet beautiful while keeping in mind their personality and style. Also she was quick!!!  I could not have been happier and will definitely hire her again in the future. Thanks Angela!"
1,"Love this sushi joint.  Their specialty rolls are delisious specially the \""sex bomb\"" and \""sex on the beach\"".  Their choice of nigiris are also delicious.  Find myself coming here from time to time, sometimes it's a long wait but always worth it."
0,"All I ever get here are the chicken fajitas and those are fairly hard to screw up.  Anything else I've tired here has been sub-par.  Really, the best thing about this place is the freshly-made tortillas."
1,"Wow the Links bar got all grown up....!\n\nI have to admit I have been avoiding this place for the last few years purely on the presumpotion that well I was a little too old to hang out here now!! Those heady days of being 25 and hungover and in need of nachos and a screen showing rugby/football etc a distant memory.\n\nSo I was truly astonished to find myself sitting outsidre here a few weeks ago, glance at a menu and see \""seafood platter\""!! This cannot be the same place where I once downed a dirty pint standing on a pool table while a rugby team chanted at me questioning my sexuality based on the duration of the \""downage\"" of the pint....!?\n\nBut in fact it is, its been Marchmontised I'ld say, and to be fair its really great. Lovely spot to enjoy a sunny day with a qaulity craft beer. \n\nHighly JD Recommended!!!"
0,"I came here during the \""Mtl \u00e0 table\"" festival, a festival that allows foodies to try out new restaurants at a fraction of the price. I was looking forward to this since I've been here before but only to have a drink. I started out with the bison tartare which was very tasty. It's after that that things started to deteriorate. We waited 45 minutes for our main course and when I spotted the waitress with our dishes I said to my friend that we're finally going to eat. Since she was facing the kitchen she said that she hoped not since those plates have been sitting next to the bar for quite a while. Sure enough, those were our plates. My osso bucco was still warm, but she said that her fish was a bit cold. Because we were so famished she didn't say anything. Speaking of my osso bucco, it was bland. There was no seasoning at all. Disappointing. I was really looking forward to the dessert since I love anything sweet. My pudding chomeur consisted of a dry white cake with caramel on top. The cake was so dry that the caramel couldn't even moisten it, which is what it's supposed to do. I've had a better pudding chomeur at rotisserie St-Hubert.\n\nBecause this was during the Mtl \u00e0 table festival, I paid a set price of 39$ for my food. At that price, I felt that it was slightly overpriced for what I got. However had I went any other time, the same meal would've cost me 54$?! That's just insane. There are better and cheaper options nearby. \n\nAnother thing; there are a couple of reviews that mention the loudness of the music. I have to agree with them. Is it necessary to blast music at 6pm? People are eating and we can barely carry on a conversation. Raise the volume at 10pm, but prior to that keep it low."
1,"Had a great supper at the Keg.  Great menu selection for both food and beverages.   Nice atmosphere, music, and comfortable seating.   I had started with the Wedge salad - excellent choice, had bacon bits and dressing!   for the main course, i had the Prime Rib... the 10oz size was a nice size, with nice trimmings garlic mash potatoes and veggies.   \n\nI would definately go back here, and looking forward to the new one opening up at Fairview Pointe-Claire."
0,"First, this should be 3 or 4 dollar signs.\n\nGreat food, but not for the money.  There should be more seafood in the seafood dishes.  We went with a group of seven.  The waiter kept giving us things that we didn't order - 2 dishes and a drink.  He left the things at the table and said I won't charge you for this, at which point we shared them or asked to have them packed up.  At the end, all of these mistakes showed up on the bill, inflating it by around $30.  He refunded one of the three items.  If they want to charge prices like they do, the service and customer satisfaction should be better.  \n\nThere were also a lot of other little mistakes.\n\nA better server could have made this 4 stars.  Also, if I didn't dissuade you from going, try the Bagnettes (awesome powdered doughnuts.)  A very nice desert to share with 2 or 4."
0,"The food was excellent. I really enjoyed the Crunchy French Toast that I had. I felt that I couldn't give them only one start when the food was really good.\n\nBut my visit was very disappointing. We visited on the afternoon of 4/21/13. This was my last day of vacation and I wanted a late breakfast. Nearby yelp search showed that this and Mr. Mama's was nearby. The Daily Egg had a half a star lesser rating, but we decided to go here because they had a yelp check-in special for the Breakfast Special for $6.99.\n\nWhen we showed them the check in special on my phone they simply stated \""You had to of printed it out.\"" We explained that that's a little difficult to do when your checking-in to a place on a mobile phone. The waitress explained that it wasn't her rule that it was the establishment's. Besides that, I wasn't impressed with the service as we hardly saw the waitress much and only ever got one refill on our drinks.\n\nThey should not be listing a check-in special if they aren't going to honor it. Two problems:\n1. People checking-in on a mobile app are not going to be carrying around a printer.\n2. There is no print option from the app. So I have to take a screenshot of the deal, send it to my PC and have it printed from there? You're average user isn't going to know how to do that."
1,"Went here for the first time yesterday. I got my order to go, but the staff were very nice while I was waiting. I haven't had pho at too many places, but this was definitely good. I ordered the pho tai (rare steak pho) and the meat was really good. Some of the pho I've had at other places had a bad flavor to it like the beef was sitting out for a few days. That definitely wasn't the case here. The vegetables were fresh, and the broth was also good. Not too oily as some others had mentioned. I'll definitely be coming back to this place. I gave 4 stars for the good-not-great egg rolls."

Unfortunately... MGM Group owns The Venetian...The Venetian is now the Largest Hotel in the World. I love the Venetian..http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Venetian_%28Las_Vegas%29\n.  Maybe I can get a comp there...hmmmmmmm  Klaus Kelterbourne.....HELLO!!"
0,"I called and made a reservation Tuesday Dec 17th, 2013 for a reservation for Christmas Eve at 6;30 for 6 people.  We show up Christmas Eve at 6;25 for the manager to say I don't have a reservation and did I really call?  I explained I am 53 years old and a business owner yes I called.  He then said......... is your reservation under another name??  I said No it is under Wood.  He then said I must be lying and he could put us in the bar.  I told him I didn't want to sit in the bar, as I am not a drinker and I don't like the atmosphere.  I said I am not paying full price for that..... he said.... Then I can't help you. So there we stood our whole family with no table!\n\nThis was so unprofessional and a true lack of customer service.  Why would a whole family show up and Lye that they called for a reservation.  I am a business owner and have purchased over 20, $100 gift certificates for my real estate clients in the past 2 years.  The manager didn't care at all about the situation and did nothing for us as customers to resolve the problem.  This restaurant is horrible and I will tell everyone I know about the LACK of Customer concern this restaurant has for their patrons!   What a mean way to treat a family on Christmas Eve when it was suppose to be a special dinner!   This restaurant could of handled this is in a much different manner!  I would start with firing the RUDE Manager!"

1,"Well, I guess the Yelp peeps has got it right again! Not only yelp said it ... Zagat and Michelin said so too. Once I saw the signs, I was like .... this will be a good dinner. \n\nWe ordered the fresh spring roll for appetizer, crab fried rice, mixed veggies with beef, and spicy basil with pork in \""medium\"" spiciness. The appetizer was an interesting combination of chinese sausage, cucumber, and fish cake(?) - the taste with the sauce was interesting to say the least. It is worth a try if you don't want that fried stuff once in a while. The crab fried rice was one of the best I had, the price is very reasonable for the amount of fried rice we all had. The veggie beef was tasty and the beef wasn't too chewy IMO, and the spicy  basil pork, though was spicy, the taste was there and it was PERFECT with white rice. Yes we got white rice on top of the generous portion. Too bad that our hotel has no fridge nor microwave ....... we could not bring it back.\n\nIF I wanna eat Thai in Vegas, we will be here again"
1,"We have added the Triple 7 to our 'must eat one lunch' at least list.  We enjoy the food, beer and neighborhood tavern feel.  The burgers are very good and the variety of their beer makes it interesting.\n\nThe pricing is very reasonable and using Yelp's scale, I would rate it a $$ also.\n\n  The casino is classic and worth the visit if for no other reason than to view the woodwork.  It's just a block north of the Plaza at the west end of the Fremont Street Experience."
1,"I don't care if it's a tourist bar, I wanted to spend my last night in Edinburgh at the World's End!! I must say, i was very impressed by their food. I ordered Beef ale pie, and it was fantastic! mashed potato wasn't as great as the server recommended, but i didn't care much. My friends ordered chicken with haggis and something else I don't remember, but they all loved what they got. And Whisky. Yes. It's hard to believe a dram of single malt is cheaper than a pint of beer/cider, but it's true. I tried 2 different single malt, which I don't normally do, but both of them were really great. I had a great time there, great food, great whisky, and great company!"
1,"Pizza is subjective - typically the best pizza you have ever had is the one you grew up with...until now.\n\nThis is the best pizza I ever had.  Lived in the northeast and had Italians and Greeks make pizza for me.  Been to Italy.  This is better.\n\nGet the spelt crust.  Get the margarita pizza, or anything else on the menu.  Get vino at the shop nearby an enjoy."
1,Our party ranged in age from 11 to 57 and we were all satisfied.  We stuck to the burgers.  My cocktail was weak tho.
1,"Got me in and out fast, inexpensive, and friendly."
1,"I can't get enough of that new style sashimi!  We ordered the ama ebi version and the ama ebis just melted in your mouth... I am still thinking about it.\n\nThey only get 4 stars because we had a late seating (only time available) and they wouldn't serve us the omakase anymore.  I had been to Nobu in NYC twice before and in my view, omakase is the only way to go when eating at Nobu."
1,"First ill start off with saying my truck is currently getting repaired at Als this very moment and I will update my review as soon as I pick it up. What brought me into Als Unibody and Frame Repair shop. About 3 weeks ago i bought a 2003 Dodge Dakota in last week to have Al take a look at it. I bought the truck off Craigslist and got ripped off big time. Not only did I have to put $2,000 in repairs to the motor and tranny within not even a week of owning it, I found out after pressing my breaks hard and hearing a loud pop underneath my truck and it pulling hard to the right that my frame was pretty much cracked in half. The seller used bondo and paint to hide it. I took the truck in to 3 different auto collision center's and was turned down by 2 of them and the 3rd one estimated the damage to be at $3,500. I decided to do some more shopping and found some private welderd and was turned down by all 3. One of them recommended I take it to Al. Im glad I did. He put my truck on the lift and checked it over explaing everything in detail. After looking my truck over he said I would need a comple right side frame piece from another truck. He called several junk yards and got a few different prices and went with the that cost me less. When he showed md the estimate he wrote up  I thought there must have been a typo coming in a little over $2,000 less then what the other shop quoted me. Of course I went forward with the repairs I felt real comfortable leaving my truck in his hands. I never felt pressured into anything and I never got the feeling that he was \""in it for tge money.\"" Now with all that being said he definitely made a good first impression and as soon as I pick up my truck I will update this review and tell about my experience after repairs r done"
0,"bleh. i hate this place with a passion and avoid like the plague. i'm happy to pay marginally higher prices elsewhere to not have to set foot in this place. this particular location is slightly better than most i've seen, hence the 1 star but that's all it has going for it."
1,Great little neighborhood sushi place. Nothing special; it's gets the job done.\n\nWarning: the 911 roll is CRAZY hot. Seriously spicy.
1,"I checked into a one bedroom suite yesterday and was blown away. The bathroom is super large, as a matter of fact there are two full baths. The decor is excellent. \nThe pool is like a garden oasis. The lifeguard was very attentive and came over and adjusted our umbrella for us. This was so nice.\nThis is a valet only property but they are pretty fast. I think they could improve by making specific lanes for valet, taxis, and shuttles. \nAlso the housekeepers need to tighten up a bit. There was an Advil on our floor when we arrived. Also a travel size bottle of something on the floor under the sink in the bathroom. Hopefully it won't be there when you check in.\nBut beyond that A++ from me.\nBest 19th anniversary ever!\nDon't believe the negative comments, they must be crazy!"
0,"The food was okay, however the decor is quite outdated. I would have enjoyed it much more if the restaurant didn't smell dingy."
1,"They always seem to have a peanut butter variety in stock, which is a total win in my book. Plus they have the best sampling policy in the city...and you can wander around Pottery Barn while you eat."
1,"Delicious cocktails.  Chill environment.  Great service.  Clean venue.\n\nCame here on a Wednesday night after a friend came into town from LA.  The door is not that tricky to find if you have any common sense (if you don't, it will make for a funny sight for those inside).\n\nThe menu contains a list of great cocktails and beers.  I tried the Summer Sazzy and the girls had The Links.  Overall the drinks were a bit strong, but they tasted great! The bartender was very nice and showed passion in creating the drinks.\n\nThere was a live DJ playing super chill deep house (my favorite) which flowed perfectly with the environment.\n\nOverall this place gets 5 stars and I will for sure be going back again in the near future.\n\nCheers!"
0,"I don't complain. Plan and simple. I've never complained about service, or anything related before.\n\nFirst off... we were seated in the \""sunny seats\"". We were told it was the only seat. Whatever... didn't care too much. Not too big of a deal. It was 113* today, and you could for sure feel the heat off the window. When the manager walked by, she apologized for the hot seats and explained that they should have a tinted window like the rest of the restaurant in no time. OK... so don't you think that the table maybe shouldn't be there?\n\nAnyway.\n\nWORST SERVER EVER. Yes, we were seated in the sunny seats. 4-6 waiters walked by us several times. I asked the hostess for water when we were sat (I'm not exaggerating how hot it was) and it took at least 5-6 minutes to get some water on the table. Our server brought the water, with no straws and simply walked away. Every single person in my party downed their water in under 5 minutes and I was never ONCE refilled my entire visit. After placing our order, the waiter was so rude & I was so hot... I asked the hostess to  make mine to go. \n\nWhen the manager walked by a second time we let her know how rude and short the waiter was. She observed him rudely taking our order & walked back to us and said: \""I'm sorry. He's usually really good. I don't know what's up with him tonight\"". Are you freaking kidding me? His service never got better and the MANAGER did NOTHING to make it right. She even walked my to go box over to the table herself.  Here's what she needs to do right: fire him. There's plenty jobless people who would do a heck of a job compared to him. But however, after more explanation below, staff members who are bad are a reflection of a bad manager. \n\nShe was fully aware how upset we were. We left, with not too much tip. There was no way I'd give that man a dime. \n\nI thought about how awful this was on the way home & decided to call once I was home. I spoke with the manager and she knew who I was. She apologized about \""hot sunny table\"" & I explained my thoughts on how that ONE table should not be used. All it's going to do tomorrow is make someone else mad. Most of all, I said the table would have been NO big deal if we had a human being as a waiter. She agreed, apologized and said she was \""going to give us a free dessert but it was just so busy she didn't get to it in time before we left\"". Guess what... didn't want dessert... it would have melted & we wanted to get the heck out! She offered me a free salad for my next visit. I nicely told her there was NO WAY I was going to return. I asked for her to return the money on my credit card and she said there was no way they could do that. I then said that I'd gladly drive the 15 minutes back to have my card refunded, that evening when I got around to it. \n\nI'm so upset nothing was done the first time we informed the manager that something wasn't right. What's odd is she agreed with us the whole time and STILL did nothing about it. Never switched waiters, never gave free drinks, NEVER REFILLED EMPTY WATER glasses, just didn't do anything. Due to this experience, I'll be contacting the owner with my experience. NEVER ever have I written a negative review on ANYTHING in my life, until this. \n\nNeedless to say I'm very sad about this. I love their food, I think it's the best Italian on the west side. Unfortunately I don't think I can ever go back, not until some new management whips it into shape."
1,good place to go catch a flick if you just want no frills and no lines. Seats are older and don't recline but never have I had to even wait in line to get ticket (maybe a person or two in front of me) Same at snack bar.
0,"I was not impressed. The fried rice was borderline between poor & mediocre, the service was 'ok', atmosphere lacking, soup not good. Granted not a huge menu experience to base an opinion on, but don't feel the need to go back and try more."
1,"I'm so glad we still have a record store in Champaign. Great, helpful staff. If what you're looking for is not in stock, they will order it. Orders are usually in within the week by my experience. They offer a really nice record collection and have great deals (sidewalk sales) on used CDs. Can you find cheaper prices online? Sure, but buying here shows support to not only Exile, but Champaign and the downtown area. The town is better for having Exile here...let's keep it that way!"
0,"During one of our visits to this location, I ordered a dish, but without chicken, as I was trying out a vegetarian diet at the time. The waitress brings it out with chicken. I politely remind her that I had ordered it without. She argues with me and tells me, \""No, you ordered this with chicken!\"" Shocked that she's arguing with me, I incredulously reply, \""I'm on a vegetarian diet, why would I order it with chicken?\"" She gave more attitude and we talked about not going back.\n\nA few months went by and we decided to give this location one more chance. Our food was terrible (overcooked, etc). We asked to swap out our entries. My wife, on the way back to our table from the bathroom, overheard the waiter making fun of us for being too picky. Who does that? How can such a person even have a job as a waiter? Hopefully, he got a job picking up trash on the side of the road and no longer works there. But we'll never know because we are never ever ever going back to Macayo's.\n\nIn summary: poorly prepared food and even worse service. Save yourself a trip. If you want to know what it's like dining here, just stay home, microwave a burrito, and repeatedly smack yourself in the face with it."
1,"Because I am a cool teacher, we held our last full class of the semester here! It gives my co instructor and I a chance to chat with our students as well as chow don on some good pizza at great prices!\n\nWe went during happy hour when Pizzas are 50% off. We had great service, our server didn't even right anything down and she got it all correct! I was amazed because there was 10 of us.\n\nOur group ordered many different pizzas, some stuffed, pasta a well as salads and a couple desserts. One of my students got a strawberry shake that looked really good!\n\nOverall it was a great experience and drink refills were aplenty!"
1,"I had a flat tire and brought my bike to Durst who was in the middle of closing and very rude, telling me there was no way they could fix it on the spot. As I am new to town, they recommended taking it to Bike Works, which I did. I called ahead to make sure they could fix my flat on the spot which the owner agreed to do. His assistant took care of it for me and even taught me how to oil the bike and also change a flat in the future! It was great, and cheap! \n\nA few days later my bike's chain fell off and you know who I went to. This time it was just Bruce. He was a little irritated that my bike was from Wal-Mart (his policy is that he doesn't work on Wal-Mart bikes), but because he knew me from before, he said he wouldn't enforce the policy on me ;) The chain issue ended up being a million other issues (because, surprise surprise, it's a Wal-Mart bike and not put together right). He taught me why the bike was crappy, and what to tell Wal-mart when I return it, which I plan on doing. \n\nHe spent so much careful time putting it together and didn't even end up charging me! (well, I bought other things, he even taught me how to lock up my bike so that it never gets stolen!) I understand when people say he comes off as unfriendly, but I like to think of Bruce as misunderstood. He's seems passionate and knowledgable about his work and his store, and he really just wants you to always have a good quality bike. Always. It probably annoys him when people bring him awful bikes, because they should have never settled for that in the first place. Condescending about my Wal-mart bike? Maybe, but what he was saying wasn't lies, he was telling it like it is, and he would know because he's been at that business since '81. He has a direct way of talking but to me, as a new bike owner, I was just happy to listen to his reflections and took it all as a learning experience. Maybe because he was direct and telling the truth is what throws people off in this customer-is-always-right country. I would bring my bike back for sure, and you should too. But just don't go in there expecting flowers to dance above his head as he works, this isn't a customer-service store with smiles and greetings, it's a get-er-done kinda store and because he works fast, it works for me!"
0,"I did not like this hotel/timeshare resort.  The pictures on the website were deceiving as to what the place actually looked like.  There was a cold feel to the lobby as well as the room.   The room was decent, but the hotel itself is lacking \""life\"".  There is no restaurant located in the hotel and there is no room service.  Both the bar and the sundeck were not open when we were there.  \n\nThe timeshare presentation was literally 3 hours.  We were told it would only be 1.5 hrs at the most.  We were very pressured to purchase the timeshare and I was quite annoyed with the salesman.  He was just too much of a hot shot and very cold toward my husband and I.  \n\nI would never choose to stay here again."
0,"Alway out of something and what moles it worse is the charge 39cents more to use my. Debit card , this place need to get with it ."
1,"It has been a good year or two since I have eaten here last and I'm not sure why. Today reinforced how much I like this place. To me, Qdoba falls into the Chipotle category although I feel the portions are definitely more generous than Chipotle. I like to get the Naked Chicken Burrito which is essentially a burrito with no tortilla. So, basically the Chipotle burrito bowl. It is just under $6 and enough for two meals. I'll instantly halve it when I get home to prevent me from overeating. It is very good. Their guacamole is very good, too. They also have a pick 2 combo for $6 and gives you smaller portions of your choice of the naked burrito, mexican soup, tacos, cheese quesadilla, etc. The other thing I like about this place is the rewards program and also how nice the employees always are. Like I said, it has been a long time since I have been back and I always comment on how friendly the employees are. Good sign."
1,"I was fortunate to go to Michael's again on 11/29/10. I actually ordered the SAME meal, it was that perfect! It was still as good the second time around, and while it was -hard- not to get the New England lobster..The Dover sole was out-of-this world divine.\n\nWanted to note that the desserts have improved! No longer cold or icy, just a perfectly cool temperature for eating. I got the Contreau chocolate mousse cake, and it was heavenly.\n\nI also splurged and got a 20-year old glass of port for dessert. Yes, i'm a goofball and don't remember the brandname. (was a tad drunk, so sue me) and it was an eye-opening rush of alcohol goodness. Smooth as the finest silk, too bad my buzz was already going good to savor it more.\n\nService? Unparralled in this city of sin. SO perfect!"
0,"When the bartender says it sucks, then the place must really suck.  A group of us went here on a Wednesday night and we were told that this place was really bumping before.  Two churches close by complained and the original owners picked up a left for a new location.  So whatever you heard in the past probably don't hold up to what it is now.  My co-worker that saw this place in the hey-day was really disappointed."
1,"We have been to Jason's Deli in other cities and never really been impressed but this one impressed us! We had a quick light lunch on a Saturday while touring uptown Charlotte. From the minute we walked in, the staff was very friendly. We split a sandwich and they even put it on 2 plates for us. They reminded us of the complimentary muffins, crackers, pickles and ice cream and the panini sandwich was delicious!"
1,"This is my second time visiting this particular Outback. It was fantastic the last time I came here and it was fantastic this time. We sit at the bar because it's a good atmosphere and the bartenders are quite pleasant to be around. Chad and Lindsey were our bartenders. They were able to keep up with all of the patrons at the bar and the orders coming in from the tables and the large wedding party all while staying cheerful and humorous.\n\nI ordered Victoria's Filet with the Parmesan Herb Crust cooked medium rare. I got a side salad and the mixed vegetables. The steak was juicy, tender and perfectly cooked. The herb crust was phenomenal. The herbs used were my favorite herbs (especially the rosemary) and the breading was light and crunchy. The side salad was fresh and I got their 1000 Island dressing with it. It's not often that you find a 1000 Island with an\""eggy\"" taste, but this one had it and I do search for it at times. I loved it. The vegetables were also well cooked and well seasoned. I also got 2 Blackberry Sangrias. They were sweet and refreshing. A perfect meal for the end of our vacation."
1,"My husband and I love to brunch at Rachel's Kitchen on the weekends. Not only did they expand and have tons of seating now, but they also have an awesome outdoor seating area and live music on the weekends. It is a great little hang out place in the spring and fall when the weather is perfect. Now, on to the important stuff...\n\nThe blueberry pancakes are my personal favorite and they come with a side of fresh fruit. My current addiction is the Wilshire smoothie. Their smoothies are a bit runnier and more juice-like than other places, but they are still super tasty. They also have a great regular breakfast of eggs, toast, potatoes, and bacon. The potatoes seem to be oven roasted and aren't greasy at all. That's the thing I really love about Rachel's kitchen, everything is done with your health in mind. I have only had lunch here once and my sandwich was nothing special. The onion rings were delicious, but there were only about 3 or 4 of them, which was disappointing. \n\nThis is a great place to relax and enjoy a meal that you won't feel guilty about later, so go grab a seat on the plaza and be serenaded while eating some delicious food!"
1,"This is our favorite sushi place. And we LOVE sushi. We're also very picky when it comes to eating it. \n\nIt's family owned and ran, and it feels like it. We get a warm welcome every time and dining there feels like they've opened their home to us. We love it, and we adore them. \n\nThe fish is highest quality-need I say more?"
1,"I am in love with this market.  Amazing selection of fresh produce, local honey, dates, salad dressings, salsas, fruit spreads, beans, nuts, grains.  Shop early to avoid the crowds and really have the best selection of what's offered (before everything is all picked over).  The crowds are insane and it's worth it to get up at 7am to be there when they open.  \n\nThis morning I bought local made salsa, bulk dried sweet basil, 2lbs of navy beans, 7 apples(honeycrisp and jazz), 4 oranges, 2 red grapefruit, 1# brussel sprouts, 1/2#green beans, 3 tomatoes, 1 cucumber, 1 eggplant, 1 green cabbage, 1# strawberries, packaged organic baby spinach, 2 red bell peppers and 3 onions. $18.54! \n\nA lot of the produce seems \""fresh from a farm\"" as it's dirty, roughly packaged and smells like veggies should. There's always something new (for me) to try - All kinds of peppers, greens, apples of every variety and in the summer - well it's like a fruit orgy ;)\n\nThe only thing stopping me from giving this place 5 stars - sometimes you have to be careful in choosing - especially berries/tomatoes and other softer fruits.  I don't expect perfection, but I expect everything to be fresh, but sometimes what they put out is a little beat up and even starting to turn.  Don't let this stop you, just go here and see."
0,"Luxor is probably going to be one of those one time hotel stay thing for me.  We booked a room in advance for King size bed, but they did not have any available for some reason when we arrived, which they made us come back in a few hours.\n\nThe staff seems very rude in this whole place, and even in some of the souvenir stores.  Aside from the fun fact of riding in the hotel elevator under the influence of alcohol, I do not see much value out of this place."
0,I love Starbucks but this could be the slowest coffee house on the planet. 30 mins to get a coffee is unbelievable and every time we go in it seems like the staff is always not even trying to speed things up. Great coffee but horrible service at this Starbucks.
1,"Amazing curry, done Japanese style. Staff is very attentive, and all of the food cooked fresh to order. They do give you options on your spiciness level desired, I'm a wimp and do 1. My husband does a 7, and he loves the bracing kick it has. All of the fried foods are perfectly done, juicy when appropriate. The sauce is the best part of the meal, hearty and ultra flavorful. My fave place to eat in Vegas!"
0,"Being a little skeptical as to if this would be any good, on the recomandation of friends figured I would give it a try bad location due to the aroma from the cows across the field not horrible but since it's a chain not an independant personally did not find to be great but edible"
1,"Awesome Burger. I had the Buffalo! It was 17 bucks, but it was well worth it. Also ordered sweet potato fries, which were delectable.\n\nTHere's a few different burgers to choose from, but you can't go wrong. Definitely the best meal I had in Las Vegas while I was there recently. Highly Recommended."
0,"Came in for a Chocolate Malt and got Hershey' s Syrup with vanilla ice cream, very disappointing."
1,I know others have been a little harsh on this location.  I have to say I like it though.  I have to confess that I do not drink coffee but I get hot chocolate and tea here.  \n\nThe biggest cons of this place is the cleanliness.  It is sometimes a little dirty but normally there are not a lot of people on staff and with the shop being open 24 hours a day it is hard to get the place super clean. Also being in the same shopping center with a bunch of other restaurants and Las Vegas Fitness Club it can be a real pain to turn left into the shopping center.\n\nThe upside to this place if the atmosphere.  I like the general chatter and coziness of the place.  I like to come here and work on school work or write reviews for Yelp.  :D  It is pretty easy to get to a plug to keep my computer running and I can get a drink and/or a snack when I am starting to digress  from homework.
1,"Awesome steakhouse.  We were a group of nine guys of less than wealthy means but the waitstaff treated us with great respect and were always attentive.\n\nI started with some oysters just because I hadn't had any in a while and enjoyed them.  I had the New York strip, and it was the first time I've ever had it perfectly cooked to medium-rare, truly delicious.  I paired it with a glass of their syrah which was one of the best glasses of my limited experience.\n\nNo one in our group complained and most raved.  For nine people with normal entrees, a few side dishes, and drinks all around the bill came to ~$900 but I imagine most people would spend more.\n\nFinally, the atmosphere was classy and understated, a welcome relief"
1,"One of the cleanest gas stations/convenient stores I go to! \n\nConveniently located on Stephanie and 215, aka between my work and home (always a plus)! I only use Chevron for my SUV, so I really can't say much on gas prices.. \n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nI must try their car wash though! It looks busy everytime I'm there so they must be doing something right!"
1,This place was a blast (pun intended). We rented a Glock and PD5 machine gun. They processed us quickly showed us how to use these weapons and we shot for about 200 rounds. The staff was very freindly. the one odd thing was it was 40 degrees in the shooting area. they did not say why they keep it so cold.
1,"Wonderful box. Staff was great, class was a lot of fun, and members were really friendly!"
0,"I wanted to love this from the get go.I have read so much about it.Long story short I don't think I will be back or could recommend this place for food.Maybe a cocktail yes as the menu for such was outstanding.Service was weak sorry Thor when I have to ask you more then once for another beverage you slip.What is wrong for a server to be locked on, is it to much to ask? Paying steak house prices for a steak on a plate and getting nothing more the sweet potato processed tater tots not impressed. Loved the decor and think you have something but asking for change from the bartender and getting attitude ( green lantern) not good. Man I wanted to love you!"
1,It's what health-intelligent people are looking for. You are now home.
0,Not really like I want.\nI went there with my wife for her birthday. I thought we will be have some surprise on it but totally up side down..... Maybe I expect too much. The food ok the chef not very good(no trick) the server kind of not much patient to listen what I want..... \nSo that's bad experience for us.
1,"If you're considering Wolfgang Puck in MGM, come here instead.\n\nSame price point; way better food.  I think I can say that with conviction because I ate at Wolfgang two nights ago.\n\nWe ordered the pan seared Ahi & the traditional potato gnocchi.  Both dishes were IMO w/o fault.  Well, maybe the veggie terrine was slightly non complimentary with the ahi dish, but the flavours of everything we ordered were great.  The tuna was JUST seared leaving a lot of the flesh uncooked (just the way they should be IMO).\n\nIf I had to write my review on the gnocchi, it'd be another page.  Gnocchi, lobster, black truffles -- how can you POSSIBLY go wrong with a dish like this?\n\nService was excellent.  I had a flight to catch at 9pm; we sat down at 7:30 and told our server on our timeline.  We were outta the resto by 8:20 and we ate at what I'd think quite a leisurely pace.  Which means the food came out pronto."
1,Yum. I just love the keg.\n\nFood is yummy\nService is fast\nServers are friendly\nPrices are decent\n\nWhat else can you ask for??
1,Went tonight and had a great dinner. Delicious pizza with 4 cheese and salami. The place is very inviting and service was attentive and personable. The tiramisu was one of the best I ever had. Be back soon!
1,"You know, I have never been to this church but have seen a lot of the worships songs on YouTube and was really taken in.  The song \"" Give Me Faith\"" has really been an impact on me and my life and I really enjoy listening to it over and over.  I can feel the presence of the Lord while I sing to the song.  Keep doing what you do and thank you for your service to God the Father."
0,"Will not stay here again.  This was our honeymoon trip.\n\n1.)  We made reservations for 3 nights and decided to add another one a little later so it came up in there system as 2 reservations - makes sense - they said this would not be a problem...lol...after our \""first reservation\"" night was over apparently the room service thought we were supposed to be gone and tried to come into our room in the middle of the night, not only once, but twice....scaring the living you-know-what out of me.  Obviously communication was lacking.\n\n2.)  When my husband went out to see who was trying to come into our room he took his key with him and found out that our keys were disconnected, meaning we needed to get new room keys.  We were told at the front desk there wouldn't be any problems with this, not the case.\n\n3.)  When we got our new keys we were told that we wouldn't be debited another safety deposit, but when we got our bill we were debited $128 and $200...once again, not what we expected.\n\n4.)  We came in to see the Mayweather fight and we initially booked a King bed and we believe when we booked the second reservation there were move reservations made thus we got a smaller room, thus for the entire stay we were give the smaller room despite the majority of the time was on the original booking with the bigger room.\n\n5.)  Room was dark, small, smelled, the trendy heavy glass shower and toilet were right next to each other and was a little uncomfortable if you know what I mean...also opening and closing the doors was annoying since they were quite heavy and made a loud clanging noise when they shut.  Lighting was poor and b/c we had the smaller room the head of our bed was against our jail size window.  Amenities were lacking, extremely slow internet, dial-up would have been faster and no coffee maker or fridge.  We don't drink but there was no mini-bar either.  I think we were supposed to be on the non-smoking floor but you could have fooled me!\n\n6.)  So when we checked out our bill was severely incorrect, I believe I was on hold for about 45 min before we could get the bill reconciled.  Also there were these odd \""resort fees\"" that we were mysteriously charged....apparently it was b/c we would have had access to the business center, the cardio room, and to receive a USA today daily...lol...don't think I saw anyone with a USA Today.  And to be honest I am not real confident that this will be my last discussion with them.  \n\nAll in all, not an impressive place to stay, bad service, no great amenities, horrible communication, no one seemed to care about your stay, don't do it, unless you just want a place to crash after a hard night of drinking, I would say that is the only thing this place is good for."
1,"I'll be brief. This is an awesome nightclub. The dance floor is spacious enough and I like how it's in the middle so it's easy to get to and exit from. Girls get two free drinks when they enter, so that was a plus. \n\nThe stage is pretty cool too, it's classy, but kind of sultry."
1,"Went here for lunch on a Tuesday. It was hard to find exactly where the restaurant was located and then when we found it, there was no one there to greet us. After waiting for a few minutes someone came to seat us. Service was very slow but kind and food was delicious! Great place for a yummy hot sandwich, burger, or salad!! Just make sure you are not constrained by time at all when you dine here. We will definitely be back and we are looking forward to trying dinner here soon!"
1,"My daughter introduced me to her favorite pizza place last night.  Many thanks!  We ordered by phone and it was ready for pickup when promised.  The toppings were exactly as we requested and the folks there were cheerful and friendly.  When we got it home and dug in, it was everything she told me it would be.  Very fresh and tasty and NOT smothered in garlic.  Some places seem to think it's ok to let garlic overpower all the other ingredients, but not Russo's.  Thanks for the great pizza!  I'll be back for more."
1,"- croque monsieur: ham and cheese sandwich with egg over it, fries: 4\n\n- strawberry pancakes with vanilla butter: 4\n\nwould come here again instead of buffets: quality of food much better"
0,"This place is a real feast for the eyes. We sat right in front of a water feature that ran the full length of the front dining room. And the service was exceptional. But the food? A solid meh. I'd give them a meh+ for the great, friendly service.\n\nThey do tableside guacamole which was pretty good. I expected a little more presentation however. If you aren't going to do that, just schlep it out from the kitchen like everything else. \n\nCarnitas were rather tasty but no real depth of flavor. For a \""signature dish\"" my level of expectation was much higher. Churros! Get them!! Served warm with banana ice cream and caramel sauce. You don't want to miss these. Do like we did and stop in just for the churros. You'll thank me.\n\nCompared to most of the restaurants in Vegas their prices weren't too high. But there's way too much great food in Vegas these days. I can't imagine this is Diego's A-game."
0,I went here a while ago and it was just a place we had never been to. The food was OK. It was not great but I didn't hate it. I would have liked it better if the crust was thicker and better. I tried a pizza that I had never had before (pineapple barbecue). The sauce wasn't very flavorfully and I heard that the salad was gross. The service was not great as well. She forgot our drinks and we had to ask again. In all it was OK food but I won't be back because I liked it.
1,The service sucked. The salsa n chip were very yummy! The cook is intertaining. . Will go again next time in vegas.
0,"First off, the food and atmosphere here is pretty darn good. I live in the area, so it's a nice place to bike over to and grab lunch. The patios are beautiful, amd the inside is comfortable. I love the San Diego Burger, and the Tacos are pretty good for a plqce that doesn't specialize in tacos.\n\nI'm writing this particular review to talk about the service. When Park on Ftemont first opened, I had a number of great dining experoences, but recently the service here has been, for the most part, mediocre if not outright nonexistent. \n\nIn most cases it was simply that the servers had unenthusiastic attitudes, no smiles, and an apparent overall distaste for having to be at work that day. A number of the times the service was slow, and it was hard to get the servers attention without them seeming annoyed. \n\nI understand that this is a pretty high traffic place in the evenings, and none of this is normally bad enough to mention. I mention it now because of the problem I had with the hostess the other day.\n\nI was planning on going to take part in Taco Tuesday with some girlfriends, but I was interested in bringing my sister who was not yet 21. I called ahead to see at what time they stopped searing minors. Since I had been there before with my sister, and had even eaten inside, I thought I had heard the girl on the phone say she could seat minors on the patio after six. When we arrived I told her we had minors in our party and asked if we could sit on the patio. She abruptly and demeaningly informed my party that minors were not allowed here after six. When I began to explain I had called someone earlier, she broke in before I could even finish to say \""that was me, and I can't seat you.\"" Taken aback, I turned around to walk out with my group. As we left, she mumbled \""Have a nice day.\"" All as she sipped on what looked like some sort of mojito based on the color and the muddled mint in the drink.\n\nI was aware that I may have misheard what she had said on the phone, but the fact that she was so unapologetic and just plain mean made me never want to go back.\n\nI'm sure I'll get over it eventually because like I said, the food is good, but I'm not a fan of the \""exclusive, you're-not-worth-our-time, cool-kids only\"" vibe the employees have been giving me. It makes me want to go there, and take new people with me, a lot less."
1,"LOVE this place!!!  Everything I've had is good..from the sunflower market salad w/grilled chicken, to the bbq chicken pizza, to the tortilla soup, to the squash enchiladas.  Their pasty chef makes a mean peanut butter cookie and my favorite are \""usually\"" oatmeal raisin...I think I finally found a new cookie!"
0,"02/14/11 LUNCH. New to the LV region. Had Mexican food in the Los Angeles area for 41 years, so I'm spoiled. Been to a few other mexican places before coming here, this is one of the first reviews I'll write about them. OK, today. Ordered cadillac margarita, which was OK but expensive. Chile relleno was OK. (Chapala's has better ones, IMO.) Good green chili chicken tamale, but not enough of the sauce. Overall, nothing special, and EXPENSIVE for the experience, especially for a lunch. PS I should mention, the wait staff, albeit a little overwhelmed by the crowd for Valentine's Day lunch, were VERY COURTEOUS and WONDERFUL to me. ALL very friendly and attentive."
0,No one should EVER be able to sit in the drive-thru and write a review on Yelp while waiting for their order! There is no GOOD reason why it's taking this long. My goodness! And don't just throw my food and money at me! And these cold ass fries! Im so glad I dont eat this bs any more! Holy cow!
0,Prices are not consignment store prices. The prices are way high. Furniture is ok but not a bargain by any means.
0,Didn't understand I wanted the lunch special and not the lunch plate. Mostly vegetables in the Kungpow chicken. Place is run down. Large portions.
0,"There are too many good,  competitively priced hotels to choose this one!\nWe booked in MARCH for a November arrival since we needed specific room accommodations (for a handicapped guest's situation). Not only was our request denied upon arrival, it was done in a terribly rude manner. In fact, not only were there NO \""handicapped\"" accommodations available, we were not even placed on the same floor!\nStay away if you have moderate standard requirements."
0,"Only came to AMC because we received a gift card. Their ticket prices suck, they do not honor my student discount and no Cherry Coke. Happy to throw money at Harkins hand over fist before I come back."
0,"I went there for breakfast and was early enough to avoid the lines. When I was seated the server asked me what I wanted to drink. When I asked for a latte it was like I was speaking another language. I settled for their coffee. The layout of the food is bizarre. There is a station for toast but the jam is on the other side of the room. If you want cereal and milk, you can help yourself to the cereal but have to ask hour server to get you some milk. They had smoked salmon and nearby was a bowl labeled whipped cream cheese. It turned out to be whipped cream, a little sweet for the salmon. There was a lot to choose from and none of it looked or tasted very good."
0,"So for around $5 you get a sandwich which consists of meat on bread and a teeny squirt of BBQ sauce. I added a side of slaw for $1.50 and it came in a cup the size of a side of ranch. \nYou order your food and then they call out your number and you go get your food on a tray from the front counter. Like in a fast-food restaurant. No one is serving you. Why is there a line for \""tip\"" on the receipt? \nMake your way down the counter and the soda fountain has RC and Big Red... now there's something you don't see everyday! \nMy sandwich (pork) was dry as hell and featured more than a few rough edges in there, but not to worry, there is a giant vat of community BBQ (eek!) sitting next to the RC fountain. Oh, and the bun for the sandwich is pretty soft. The sauce is a bit sweet, no heat to it at all, no depth... no thanks.\nDirty tables, dirty bathroom with no paper towels left in the dispenser so I had to use a paper toilet seat cover to dry my hands. \nThe cole slaw was tasty, tho. So... yeah."
1,"SOLO DINERS, REJOICE!\n\nAre you (or will you be) alone in Vegas and wish you had someone to share that gourmet tasting experience with, but not ready to call an escort service?\n\nL'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in the MGM Grand is a wonderful answer. This exceptional restaurant is designed for interaction with the chef and his kitchen and serving staff as they perform culinary magic in their beautiful open kitchen, as well as with fellow diners seated at the counter.\n\nWhether you choose one of the tasting menus or pick and choose from the a la carte offerings, the offerings are extraordinary, adventuresome and delectable, each dish presented as artfully as it has been prepared. For me, last night's Lobster Fricassee was to die for, as was my snapper starter, and all of us within earshot of each other waxed poetic over the potato accompaniment! And dessert? Simply not to be missed. The wine list also will delight solo diners, with a large offering of splits and wines by the glass.\n\nAll in all, dining to rival the best entertainment on The Strip!"
0,"The food and environment were pretty good the two times I visited but the staff, at least the men, are churlish. They act grumpy and as if they are doing you a favor by serving you food at all. The menu, as others stated, is daunting."
0,"Like the food, but today was my first time at this location. Clean location and convenient for a quick lunch. However the food was  too salty. All customers were frustrated because no one understands what we are asking for. I'm pretty sure they were saying something about my butt in Spanish. People left with food but frustrated and the lady taking the food orders kept answering her cell phone that rang incessantly. I won't be back to this location. For lunch maybe a different shift."
0,"I guess my expectation of excellent customer service needs to be re-calibrated.  I walk into the store yesterday afternoon for the 1st time, hoping that I can be measured for proper running shoes.  OK, keep in mind, it is 116 degrees outside so the place was not busy.  There was a male customer who was trying on a pair of shoes, but John, the salesperson, was not helping him.  Instead, John received a phone call on his mobile from his landlord and proceeds to have an in-depth conversation.  The male customer waits a few minutes and then decides to leave.  Why? Probably because John was still on the phone!  Then, John has the audacity to put the caller on hold and ask the customer if he needed some assistance before he walks out the door!  That should have been my first clue to start following the customer out the door!  But I didn't, which is why I am writing this review.\n\nEventually, the phone conversation ends, and John takes a look at my own shoes and my gait, never asking to measure my feet.  He proceeds to advise me that a newer model of my shoe just arrived so he brings them out.  Another customer arrives and he leaves me to my shoes, only asking me \""how do they feel\"".  Really?  I intend to spend over $110 and that is all you do????\n\nNeedless to say, I am so disappointed.  I left the store with my purchase feeling that I just got \""the wool pulled over my head\"", the same feeling after dealing with a used car salesperson who is only after the sale.  My own occupation requires phenomenal customer service, and believe me, if I exhibited this type of behavior, I wouldn't be employed very long."
0,"Read the fine print and do NOT believe the words that the club sales person states!!!!  When we signed up we were NOT interested in a set month term commitment and wanted the ability to get out with 30 (ish) days notice. He assured us multiple times that we could get out with no penalty at any time. He was so nice, super friendly, trustable!  (Ha). We quickly signed off on the paperwork...trusting all he said.  Our mistake. \nFast forward 7 months...we want to cancel and are locked into a 26 month commitment?!?!?  The paperwork we signed  supposedly said that, we had 3 days to catch his lie...and then, it was too late, we were locked in. The lying salesperson wasnt even a concern of corporate. \nI've heard these horror gym membership stories before but never believed they really happened.  Well...we are living proof!  \nThey lack integrity and don't even care. Be warned!!"
1,"Yup, it's a generous 4 stars from me, despite the grimaces that seem to appear on people's faces when I mention the place.\n\nNow there is a slight possibility that the bottle of wine I had before going out combined with the vodka and shots consumed in the club may have slightly clouded my judgement in it's favour.\n\nHowever Espionage is HUGE which is great if, like me, you like a bit of space to shake your shimmy. There are TV screens showing videos of the music being played - cue a hilarious/mortifying attempt by me and my pals to emulate Beyonce. It was busy, the people there were all really friendly (or maybe that was just me!) and out to have a good time and it's ideal if there are a group of you out to mingle.\n\nRefined it is not however, and they definately know their shots better than their cocktails. Me and 2 friends also had to get creative with a cardboard loo roll tube as there was no toilet roll even early on in the night... But hey ho, it all adds to the hilar recollections the next day. Maybe it's a bit naff and uncool compared to other Edinburgh clubs but the music got us on the dancefloor, it was cheap and cheerful and I pulled a hot guy :) Could be worse!"
1,"We went here while on a trip home to visit family.  Our foodie friends told us about this place so we made the drive from The QC to check it out.  We went on a Monday night and it wasn't too busy.  We waited about 10 minutes for a table for 4.  They have some unique refreshments and we opted for The Natural and the Hangover Rx.  Between the two, the Hangover Rx was better...tasty.\n\nWe had the Hummus for an appetizer and it was VERY good...some of the best I've had outside of Haji Baba.  The pita's didn't hold a cancle to hand-made ones from Haji Baba or other middle eastern places, but they were good and fresh.\n\nFor a salad we split the Chicken Chopped salad...fantastic. and portioned appropriately...everything was fresh.\n\nMy wife ordered the steak tacos and I had the Panang Curry for our entrees.  Both were delicious.  The panang was surprisingly spicy for a restaurant curry (without asking my desired heat level) but I like it like that so it was perfect for me.  I don't normally like brown rice, but couldn't tell the difference in my dish...it was very, very good.\n\nThe restaurant boasts about fresh, sustainable and organic foods and you can tell...all the other dishes I saw coming out of the kitchen appeared that way as well.\n\nI would have given 5 stars, but the service was a little slow for what appeared like a normal night that wasn't too busy.  It took longer than normal for our entrees I felt, especially when appetizer and salad came out almost immediately.  If they could fine tune service, it would be an even better dining experience.\n\nWhen we come back to AZ again and looking for a fresh place to go, I'd definitely consider True Food again...and would recommend it to anyone.\n\nSorry, no desserts on this trip to speak of...too full."
1,"This place is EXACTLY what I was looking for! I found a Groupon for a cut and condition at R Salon, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I was not only blown away by the service, but Nikki is my new go to. She's the kind of stylist that highlights what you have, and doesn't try to hide it by crazy cuts and funky coloring (unless that's what you're looking for). I couldn't be more pleased with how my hair turned out, and that she didn't let me cut all my hair off!!!\n\nOverall, if you're looking for the perfect styling experience, R Salon is your place."
1,"First time trying Bistro Pizza.  We got the meatball and ricotta pizza, the bistro salad, and free garlic knots with our Yelp check in.  Everything was delicious.  The bistro salad had fantastic balsamic marinated tomatoes and red peppers, artichokes, and mozzarella.   The garlic knots are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and very garlicky.  They come with a yummy marinara dipping sauce.  The main event, the pizza, was very good.  Crispy crust, good sauce, the meatballs were very delicious.   It was a little more expensive than I expected, but we will be coming here again.  Maybe to dine in since they have booths and board games."
1,The food here was awesome!! I just went for the second time and was not disappointed to have gone back. I had the breakfast burrito with the short ribs inside. I swap the regular eggs for egg whites and also add a mimosa :-).
0,"Arrived with out of town guests and found restaurant not planning to open until 4 PM. Contrary to their published hours. No signs, only advised by employee sweeping off patio. Had checked their website before leaving home (45 miles away) and no notice on site. 4 year old grand-daughter named Alice was so upset as she wanted to see \""a boy named Alice\"". Will never return!!!!!!"
0,"I only live about 15 minutes from the airport, so typically a cab is the easiest way to get home without hassling someone to pick me up.   I got into the cab and saw a credit card machine which was good because I only had $24 on me.   I told this to the cab driver and he got onto the freeway informed me that the machine doesn't always work, but  if it doesn't I'll take you to the closest ATM.... As a girl, it's not the most comfortable situation, getting cash while a cab driver is waiting in the car... with your belongings!  Unfortunately the cab fare was $28 and the machine wasn't working... so there I was at the ATM.  It ended up not being the most convenient options since it added about 15 minutes onto my trip and the $2.50 ATM fee.   The driver was nice, the cab was clean, but don't advertise that you take CC and not have the machine work!"
0,Wow I got a email from a worker from this place! I shall not go back there I was not planning on it! I was told if I wanted beer or wine go somewhere eles! Wow It looks like I am going to have to block this person!
0,"I'm an Oxford girl myself, and so always had a slight, lingering suspicion of anything with the word Cambridge in the title; in the case of the Cambridge bar, this unease was exacerbated by the fact that the Oxford Bar is just down the road.\n\nHowever, I'm sure I went in with an open mind, determined to enjoy myself.  Which I did, mostly. It's a lively and buzzy place that attracts a young-ish crowd, noisy, but still possible to have a conversation there.\nI've just got a couple of gripes about this place; firstly, I ordered a veggie burger that cost about six pounds, was burnt, and didn't even come with chips! Which was disappointing.  \n\nSecondly, and this may seem petty but I have strong feelings about these things, as the evening drew to a close, my friends and I decided to have just another half pint each before going home, so I went to the bar clutching what I thought was a more than sufficient amount of money.  I had, of course, calculated how much it would cost by halving the price of a normal pint, because that's the way it works in every other pub.  That makes sense, because it's the same beer but you're only having half as much of it, so it should cost half the amount, right? Well, not in the Cambridge, where a half is \u00a32.90, as much as a whole pint costs in most other establishments.  I was outraged more on principle than about the actual money.\n\nSo, I shall not be frequenting this place, and have had my irrational prejudice confirmed: places named Cambridge are not to be trusted."
0,"Ok this place is HIGHLY OVER RATED! I really would pass. The food was mediocre are best, slightly cold when served. Asking for refills on coffee or ice tea was like waiting for Congressional Approval... \n\nThe menu looks enticing overall, even gives one hope, but seems to fall desperately short of combining what promises to be really good combination of flavors. \n\nUnfortunately the service was just as abysmal. Nice people, sweet, like molasses's about the same speed.\n\nThere are so many great places in the Metro Phoenix/Scottsdale Area.  Don't stop, keep on driving or go to Einstein Bagels next door. You will be much happier."
0,"I should have read the yelp review before booking, not sure how this place can get away with charging a daily \""resort fee\"" of $14.95. This Motel is far from resort quality with terrible customer service from check in to the Bait Shop and the bartenders and waitresses. Not to mention we were there from thurs-Sunday and the smell of vomit never left the bar area, it didn't smell fresh it smelled like it had soaked into the carpet to remain soiled forever. The rooms are extremely out of date which could have been forgiven do to the low cost of the first two nights and the fact that you aren't in your room very much when in Vegas however when considering the rest of the poor experience we will never return."
1,"I've never had bad service here and I actually enjoy eating here for lunch because the only wait is the line. My sandwich is always ready within 2-4 minutes of when I order it. \n\nI like the staff cause they always seem to be in a good mood and they normally play good rock/alternative music. Although, one day they were playing that annoying Friday song by Rebecca Black and some teeny pop crap... manager must have been out that day. Whatever, food was still good!"
0,"This is a one point five star review. I do not write scathing reviews but the food quality is way below par. You can taste that recently they decided to cut food costs and reduce quality.\n\nNote: the gelato bar is still awesome but the cup they serve it in is the size of a small butter pad.\n\nSushi. You can tell they removed the saran wrap and serve sushi made off-site. I am going to set the over-under on length of time the rice was made at seven hours. Smart money bets the over. For you not sports bet enthusiasts, this means the rice is old. Oh, the fish tastes stale and fake.\n\nSeafood. The crab legs look and taste like frozen water. They should have a sign plaque that says \""Weak-ass snow crab legs\"". \n\nShrimp: tolerable.\n\nAsian food. It was ok. The food preserves well under heat lamps and food warmers. The veggies held up well \n\nItalian salami and greek salad: passable.\n\nBone marrow tasted like it was diseased cow. You can't just take any old bone and dole it out as bone marrow. It has to be high quality.\n\nLamb chops or lamb shank: THERE WAS NONE.\n\nRibeye: ABSENT.\n\nRoast beef: Quality was like an Old Country Buffet \n\nSalad: Made me yearn for Sweet Tomatos.\n\nI love and respect Connie Chang's Yelp reviews. She needs to update her 06-18-2012 review that is almost one year old. This buffet has changed. Do not eat here until I update that it is better here.\n\nBTW, I was STARVED when I ate here. It was after swimming on the 14th floor pool over Memorial Day. I ate there at 515pm on FRI during Memorial Day."
0,Major disappointment. Either Gordon Ramsay's shows are a fake ass front or he needs to get over here to BurGR and get things in order the way he makes it appear on tv. Having eaten at his pub and grill before and having a great experience I didn't think BurGR was going to be the way it ended up. The wait was 2 hours to get a table and once inside it took forever to even get our order taken. The jalape\u00f1o poppers we stared out with were terrible and I've had better at. sonic. The inside was still cold. Unfortunately cold food seemed to be the theme of the night. Our fries and onion rings were brought out cold. My burger was cold and flavorless while the hot dog I had was just ridiculously too big for the bun it was on. Our server and many inexcusable reasons why he didn't get our food to us sooner. When you first walk into this place they have flames shooting all over so where the heck was the hot food and flavor? I really hoped for a better burger at this place.
1,"After going to another repair shop and being told my shoes could not be repaired, I decided to get a second opinion.  Mr. Jackson works and runs this store.  He told me yes, he could fix them and it would be about $20.  I agreed.  He called me about a week later and told me the shoes were ready.  I went today to pick them up and they looked great and it was only $15.  I would use his services again."
0,"We've been to the Garage several times (always brought other friends with us because it was close and we liked the atmosphere and the food was pretty good). Service was okay. Recently we chose to go there because we had purchased a groupon. Five of us ate dinner (food was okay to decent) and had two drinks a piece. The bill game to $125 without tip. The Garage deducted the $30 groupon, but we didn't notice until after we left that they tacked on an extra $16 fee. I went back to ask why the extra $16 fee? They said if you use the groupon during happy hour you lost all happy hour pricing. This wasn't mentioned at the time otherwise I wouldn't have used my groupon. They said it was on the groupon that it wasn't valid for happy hour (fine, then don't take it and by the way we also had five dinners). We didn't go there for happy hour, we went for dinner. At the end of the day, I spent $15 for the groupon, paid an extra $16 for the happy hour charge (total of $31 dollars) and received a $30 deduction. Not good math. My conclusion - don't go there with your groupon during happy hour, you might get screwed. Also, as a restaurant,  you would think you would want to make a return, local, recommending customer happy, instead of screw them. I won't be returning and I won't be bringing my friends either. We can go to Zipps, the Vig or Phoenix City Grille instead."
0,"Do not go here unless you want to be drugged and possibly die. My son in law and his friend were drugged at this \""place\"" . This was confirmed at tha hospital that he was carried to in an ambulance. The bartenders must be doing this, as the drinks did NOT leave their hands! \nGoogle the term\""drugged in Las Vegas\"" and see for your selves! \n If you have an analysis kit, then Just Maybe you could trust this bar. My son in law was  kept in the hospital- his friend went to sleep for 17 hours! \n Final comment- if the mob still ran las vegas, this place would be closed! \n BEWARE!\n\nDavid Blumenthal"
1,Came here since it was on Man vs. Food to try the food and see how it is. I ordered the Jewish Sliders that were made famous as on the show and boy was it good. I seriously can't explain just how amazing this plate is. Wish I lived in Arizona just to eat here. I didn't get a chance to try their bakery but it looks like it is really good and worth a stop. It definitely hit the spot. Beef brisket and a potato pancake sliders? Yes please! \n\nMust have meal: Original Jewish Sliders
1,"Onion soup had delicious gruyere cheese.\n\nSteak was filling and the blue cheese dressing was great! \n\nThe servers were fast and very professional.\n\nA great choice for a classic restaurant. \nIf it's busy, don't expect to see the bellagio fountains from the outside patio...."
0,"Look, I'm not about to bitch and moan and say that everything about this place is bad. It is, in fact, a rather solid place to have a coffee. As in, if you'd like a forgettable coffee in a forgettable setting served by forgettable service.\n\nHowever, what I find unacceptable is that my favourite soup, the one I look forward to (the Red Thai Chicken) tasted not just bland, but actually watered down compared to Press Coffee. I have this thing about my soup, I like the soup to be, I don't know, soupie. If I wanted a bouillon, I would have ordered it. Now I go to Press Coffee a lot, mainly because I like the staff (same as Kilimanjaro I think), the ambiance, and the coffee, but the reason I go there is my soup (notice the snotty possessive). Never-have-I-ever been disappointing by Press Coffee's Red Thai Chicken. So when I popped in to Kilimanjaro, and noticed the sign for my favourite soup, I took some home with me.\n\nI am now a very sad Lou. Imagine me, if you will, looking misty-eyed out of the window (violin? Anyone?). You see, I thought me and Red Thai were at the very least going steady, but today I found that apparently he's just not that in to me. You see, he was watered down, a fraction of his former self. It just wasn't the same soup I've fallen in love with. Also, there was a strange piece of chicken in the soup that not only looked processed (or as if it had been snipped with tongs) it had bone in it, actual sharp bone that pierced my mouth. I took at my tongue-ring for a reason, I would not like it back while eating soup, but thanks for trying.\nI have also had previous experience with this place serving me some accidental gristle with my bacon, but thought it was a fluke. Apparently not so much.\n\nI'll stick with Press Coffee, thank you very much. I'm not impressed with Kilimanjaro.\n\nLet me go stare out of that window a little more, I'm nowhere near done pouting."
1,"Of the 3 Cuban restaurants I've been to recently (Varadero, Cuba Cafe, Havana Grill), this one gets my top rating.  The place looks and feels like \""Cuban food for the working class\"", but it beats the other places hands down!  For one, all of the dishes we had (including our kids) were extremely hearty, rich, and flavorful.  None of this \""health-conscious\"", lightened down for today's slim American type food here.\n\nEven the black beans were thick and pasty (but smooth).  The Papas Rellenas appetizer filled up my 9 year old happily, though we also ordered her a full platter as well.  We also got a rich, full-bodied chicken soup, a little like the tortilla soups you sometimes find at Mexican restaurants, but definitely unique in flavor.  My 6-year old decided to help me finish it before I had a choice.  Ropa Vieja and the Masas de Puerco were fabulous and filling, with the meats perfectly marinated and tender.  \n\nFor me, the only disappointment was the Tres Leches cake we had for dessert.  They don't make it onsite, and it had a little too 'mainstream' texture - a bit too blantantly moist, a bit too much icing, and not enough of that hidden 'cream' that surprises you with the real deal.  It just wasn't right (go to the Cuba Cafe for the perfect Tres Leches!).\n\nBut...other than the cake...this is my favorite of the 3 Cuban restaurants in town that I've tried.  If you want beautifully presented Cuban food, go to the Havana Grill.  If you want a quaint, but up-to-date chic atmosphere (and the best Tres leches cake), go to the Cuba Cafe.  But for the best overall Cuban home cooking, Varadero is the place...and make sure you come hungry and be careful NOT to over-order (not that leftovers won't taste great the next day!)."
1,Can't go wrong with the Vespa (v.). Heaped with toppings on a sizeable jacket potato.
0,"Cute gimmick of a place, if you're bringing the wife and kids and maybe grandma too. If you're younger or single and looking for a hip party, this is a complete waste of your time. Head to Cosmo or Encore pools instead."
0,"Disgusting!!! I don't recommend this place at all!! Save your money and go to an all you can eat sushi bar!!! If I could I would give this place 0 stars!!! YUCK!!!!! 6 pieces of sashimi for $15?!?!?! you can go to YAMA SUSHI and pay 23.99 for ALL YOU CAN EAT!!!! I got the tonkatsu and had to even ask for rice, WTF?!? The miso soup wasn't even hot and the salad tasted like it had sand in it!!!! THIS PLACE WILL NOT LAST FOR SURE [BIG THUMBS DOWN FOR THIS RESTAURANT]"
1,"I stayed here back in early August for my best friends bachelor party. There were 8 of us total and we had two rooms that were connected together. There was plenty of room and the futons in the living room was large and comfortable. This place really had everything. It's really set up like a condo. It came with everything you needed. For example washer & dryer, iron & ironing board, all kitchen utensils, safe, jet tub in bedroom etc. I was really surprised how this place had so much to offer. Would definitely stay here again. It right across the street from Walgreen's."
0,"In one word - underwhelming. A little surprised that they are currently rated 4 stars. Had a Groupon and heard good things about this place, so decided to give it a try.\n\nFirst impression: we were seated at a table right in front of a door that wait staff were going in and out of (to the outdoor patio). To top it off, the table was REALLY wobbly.\n\nSecond impression: ordered the bruschetta to start...mediocre. Bread was not toasted enough thus it was soggy. Tomatoes not very flavorful.\n\nThird impression: ordered the grilled vegetable pasta. For $18, I could have made this at home for about $5. Menu said it had mushrooms...no mushrooms. Not very flavorful, even a hint of olive oil or garlic would have helped.\n\nWithout the Groupon, our total would've been $60 for two people (2 entrees, 1 appetizer). Service was good, but the food needs major improvement to charge those prices."
0,"We used midway because statefarm suggested them because one of their customers hit our car. We are very happy with the repairs. You can't tell there was ever any damage.  \n\nThe length of the process was a tad ridiculous considering how little damage the car actually had. It took 3 weeks and each week we were told \""it will be ready by the end of next week\"". We are not happy with the statefarm rep we had to deal with there because he basically flat out lied to us more than once. The 2nd time he called to tell us the car would be done \""end of next week\""  he said the rim & axle was a few days out. Then the following week he calls again to tell us he can't find the rim we had and have to pick a different one. If he would have told us that the week prior, it wouldn't hae been as annoying. We were given 3 options with horrible pictures to choose from. So in the email to tell him which rim we decided with, we stated we wanted to keep the old rims (3 were perfect conditions and we can get them online still). We go to pick up the car, we ask the girls at the front if the rims will be in the car. She said if we told Mike we wanted to keep them then yes. Mike pulls the car up and we asked him. He said he had no idea we wanted to keep them and we never told him. (like I said, it was the same email we sent saying which rim we wanted). He said the guys already threw them out. But then in the same conversation said the guy he got our new rims for wanted them to salvage. Then tried to play it off like we got this awesome deal. We weren't paying a dime because it wasn't our fault in the accident. \n\nOverall, after 3 long weeks and 2 rental cars, we got our car back and probably won't be dealing with midway ever again."

They are closed on Sundays and coinsidently i always have a craving for their food on Sundays..I drive to Pedros on sunday afternoons forgetting they are closed...Thats how gud their food is !! Trust me !
1,"As close to Lombardi's (NYC) or Pepe's (CT) as you'll get here in AZ. All locations here are good (the one in Tucson is smaller and the wait is usually relatively short). Excellent quality, flavor and staff. They know what made Lombardi's and Pepe's successful and they've draw on that.  Yummmmn"
0,"I had some time to kill and stopped in here on an impulse to try a gel manicure. I've done gel manicures myself at home and love how they last at least two weeks. Since I was treating myself and having them done, I figured I'd go for the french manicure since I'm not that coordinated to do that for myself. \n\nI was the only customer in there, until a woman stopped in to have a nail repaired. Having nothing else to do, the rest of the staff sat around and talked and listened to their ipods and played with their phones. The place wasn't very clean and a fine layer of nail dust seemed to coat everything at my nail techs station. \n\nShe shaped my nails kind of square-ish, which is not really my preference, but they look pretty good. You have to \""cure\"" the polish under the UV light for each layer in order to set it. This just takes a minute or two but my nail tech proceeded to use her phone during this time. I find this annoying.  I paid $35 plus tip for the french gel manicure, and they charge $30 for a regular gel manicure. \n\nMy disappointment as I look at my nails one day later, is that there is a chip already. Gel nails aren't supposed to chip and they are supposed to last at least two weeks and just sort of grow out as your nails grow. So what's the deal? I guess I'm better off doing them by myself at home."
0,"I can't believe I didn't check the reviews before coming here. This place was disgusting. The price person was ridiculous for such cruddy quality food. \n\nWhere do I start off? I started with soup, as soon as I saw it from a far being swirled around by the chef standing by, I felt a little skeptical about getting it. You could automatically tell that shit was all starch, because it was soooooo thick. It was soooo bland, blegh. Crab legs? That stuff tasted so old, it was frozen cold too. And there's barely any meat. My boyfriend took advantage of their meat selection. He mentioned the meat was tough and bland. We are a big fan of truffle recipes. And they had macaroni and cheese made with some truffle oil. It was gross, it was all butter and a tiny dash of truffle oil to make it smell like it. \n\nThe only thing good about this place, in terms of food, was their unlimited crepes. I was able to get a dinner crepe and a dessert crepe after. Both were OKAY. \n\nThe staff that were working and taking our plates were very sweet. They refilled our drinks as soon as they were empty and they took our plates fast. I was able to converse with one of the chefs making my crepe, she was cool too. \n\nBut, I thought this place wasn't good. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Even one of our taxi drivers said that this place is one of the worst buffets here because we told him how we ate there."
0,"What happened to you Outback!? We have been frequenting you for years and the last several times we have been there - were very disappointing!  Food served cold, steaks not cooked to order, and one time we had a very rude Server, (female). Goodbye Outback."
1,"I always order the same thing here. At all chipotles really. I love the consistency. As with most places like this, they have standards to adhere to and this location does a fine job of that. I always know what I'm getting here. This location seems to be popular by the amount of people I always see here.\n\nContrary to some reviews about this locations, I don't feel that they \""skimp\"" on the portion sizes. I don't get beans, sour cream, sauces, or \""extra\"" anything and it's still overflowing. It's enough for me and I'm 6'1\""... Although it IS pretty addictive so I always want more. Lol. \n\nMy recommendation would be to go at non-peak hours because the line is significantly shorter."
1,"Tommy's is great because they smoother everything in their signature Chili! I mean who does not love chili on their fries? Hot Dogs... etc.... Personally, anytime I have a craving for chili cheese fries, you can better your last dollar I will be heading over to Tommy's..... That and it's real close by my house to. \n\nMind you, this place is not exactly for the \""health conscious people\"""
1,"This is a very unique experience for fans of Chinese food.  The dishes are very creative and they mix in flavors not normally found in traditional Chinese.  I had heard good things about this place so I decided to try it out for myself, and wow were they right.  The decor is very creative with great art work on the walls makes the whole place look spacious but cozy at the same time.   And the food is just so good.  The shrimp and scallops are great, the duck is probably the best I've ever had."
1,"best Thai food I've ever had in my whole life!!!!!\n\nmy bf and I went here during our spring break trip to Vegas. he heard of this restaurant from a Foodie friend and really wanna take me here. I was not very impressed during our first visit as the restaurant is located in a shady, shady, shady neighborhood. we arrived there at 3pm that afternoon only to find that the restaurant only open for lunch 11ish to 2:30 and dinner starting from 5:30pm. so at that moment I felt somewhat relieved.\n\nthe next day we were looking for places to have a quick dinner before heading to the airport. as I was curious how this restaurant was able to deserve such a good review on Yelp, I proposed we try this place! we arrived exactly at 5:30, hoping to get in immediately when it opens. and guess what? there was already a very long waiting line in front of the restaurant! definitely a good sign! \n\nas soon as we were able to get into the restaurant, a waiter comes to us with a charming smile asking if we had a reservation or not. (so apparently they take reservations and can be overly booked) we expressed our need to catch a flight and the waiter was very kind in finding a seat for us as quickly as possible. when we sat down and started to checking out the interior of the restaurant, we realized where the  owner have spent all her money. the interior decoration looks like a fancy, high-class dining room with chandeliers, hard wood tables and chairs, mirror-like clean floors and a huge wine collection!\n\nit's quite unfortunate we were not able to try the wine due to time constraints and we only had one dish as neither me nor my bf was hungry. we tried the crisp duck curry  as recommended and it turns out to be really really great! the duck was crispy outside, juicy inside and when the curry swims in your mouth, you would want to bite your tongue off! I also ordered a Thai ice tea and it doesn't fail to surprise me either!\n\nbtw, the waiter is very tentative and knows what dish to get!\n\nwell, enough has been said. this is a much try in Vegas!"
0,Don't waste your time and money like I did. Look up mark fugit orthodics. He custom makes them for your feet at less than 200! I'll never get my money back on a product that helped minimally and made other parts numb.
1,"The people on duty both times I shopped here were great. Friendly, knowledgeable, and eager to provide excellent customer service. Unbelievable this day and age!  I went there for a new battery for my phone, and a bluetooth ear phone.  They let me test the ear phone in the store to make sure it was compatible with my phone, and went the extra mile to show other products in my price range.  They were so friendly I was actually looking around the store for something extra to buy just to give them more money!  :-)  Not only would I come back here, but I'd urge everyone else to go here and keep this business around. They deserve it.  I hope they read these reviews and see how happy they make their customers."

1,Great experience of indoor carting with a bit of technology to boot.  Really impressed with the timed racing and a fairly comprehensive printout for each racer at the end of each race to see how you compare to each other as well as those who have raced that particular week.  Really an awesome experience and highly recommend if have transportation to get to this place!
0,"I have ordered Red Devil's pizza and wings for takeout for years now, but today was the first time I dined in the restaurant.  We started with the potato skins which were served slightly overcooked and without any sour cream, which Red Devil does not carry.  (Really? Who serves potato skins without sour cream).  For our entrees, I ordered the baked lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the double bacon cheeseburger.  I only took about two bites of my lasagna which was so overloaded with flavorless marinara that I could not bare another, and my boyfriend only ate about half of his double cheeseburger that looked comparable to a McDonald's burger and tasted like a \""slightly better quality school lunch burger\"".  These three items and one Pepsi cost us 32 dollars before tip.  All in all, we left hungry and forty dollars poorer.    We will not be back for anything but the occasional pizza and wings."
1,Food was amazing. Very spicy. Love hot food and got 5/10 which was still very hot. Highly recommend even though its off the strip a bit.
0,"I was totally intrigued the first time I heard of frozen hot chocolate. How can it be frozen and hot?! Well.. after trying it out first hand, I conclude that it was a total waste of my $12 (for just a to go cup size)! It was simply a thick powdery super sweet cold chocolate drink! I rather have a glass of chocolate milk ):\n\nI later found out that this other place called sugar factory also has frozen hot chocolate on their menu- for just $6-7. If any of my friends insist on trying it in the future, I would take them to this place instead. I wonder what big of a diff it will be."
0,Such unsanitary conditions. I ordered two slices of pizza to go and the woman working did not use gloves to pick up my pizza and place it in the box. She compulsively touched her hair and cell phone in between customer orders and never once washed or hands or put on gloves. The fountain machine was out of ice and when I alerted the woman working the register she told me just to get a drink and that it should be cold enough without needing ice. Horrible service and disgusting conditions! I'll never go back.
0,I hate this place. Terrible service and dining experience. Hostess that doesn't really want to be there. Waitresses overburdened with vast real estate. Managers not paying attention and the food was subpar. Chicken pot pie was tiny and way undercooked.
0,Great food! Below average service.

0,"I went during the day in the middle of the week and ate outside, was pretty slow so I was really surprised it took over 30min to get food. I got the fish and chips which I don't really like fish that much but I like cod, catfish and salmon if it's fried and fresh. The fish tasted... old, it was soft and blubbery. However I should say the best fish I've had has been from the bay in Cali. I've even had box fish that tasted better.\n\nThey were sweet and kind enough to give me chicken instead, but the chicken was soft and it tasted like they fried it in the fish oil, even the next day at home it tasted fishy, I wanted to like it, but I couldn't.\n\nAlthough I will add my friend thinks this place is the greatest, but he's always drunk when he's there, so there's that."
1,"This is such a fabulous place!! I have driven by it for the past year and finally stopped in to check it out. HUGE menu, homemade corned beef, pastrami, sauerkraut, pierogies, creative and delicious sandwiches and more. We got a sassano, thanksgiving dinner pierogies, buffalo chicken pierogies, cheesesteak pierogies - they were all yummy and each kind came with its own dip. Really tasty! Reasonable prices, and super friendly staff. Seating is limited and casual. Can't wait to go back!"
1,"Panera Bread, although a tad overpriced in my opinion, is a decent place to a grab a quick bite to eat. I am not going to say they are a healthy option compared to other \""fast\"" type eateries because I don't think everything on their menu is really promoting great health. However, it is a step up from a burger and fries combo at McDonald's. \n\nThis Panera is a staple of The District, sits directly facing the parking lot and is conveniently located. The establishment is large and spacious, which is good, because anytime I have been here the place has been steady with patrons. Customer service is good, although I always get hit up to get their card, which I decline, because I don't go to Panera enough to warrant getting the card. Plus, all in all I am kind of fed up with this every freakin' place I go wants to give me some card deal. Hrumph. Anyway.\n\nFood - I ordered the Chipotle Panini and my husband ordered the Smokehouse Trukey Panini. Both came out deliciously melty and warm, pressed perfectly. I received mine with chips, my husband got a cut up apple, so we shared. Overall loved the paninis. We also ordered a yummy blueberry muffin which was dense and flavorful. \n\nQuality vs. price - Again, as stated above I feel Panera to be overpriced. I got two combo paninis (which do not come with a drink), one small drink, and a muffin, my total came to almost 20 bucks. The paninis are on the smaller side, so the price value does not exactly match the quality and quantity of what you are receiving. However, the taste is good.\n\nSo you have to fight your battles with fast, convenient, \""healthier\"" food. Of course I will return to Panera Bread in the future. I just wish it did not hurt my wallet so bad."
1,"Too sad that I've moved away from Roberto's Taco Shop territory. I lived just around the block from this location and hunger pangs were usually cured by Roberto's. I only ever really get one or two things from here when I go, but consistency is what I liked! The meat in the burritos are a little tough sometimes or overcooked, so I hardly get those but Roberto's is my go-to for carne asada fries. Extra cheese and ask for some jalapenos before I drive off and I'm good to go. Best carne asada fries I've had in the valley."
1,Great Chicago style pizza and AMAZING mozzarella sticks. My mouth is watering just thinking about them... I can't wait to go back to Arizona. Definitely make a stop here if you're a pizza lover.\n\nThe entire restaurant is doused in sports memorabilia and every TV is on a different sporting event. I think there is even some arcade games in the back!
1,I love love love Red Velvet Cafe! I almost didn't want to write this review in fear of it becoming overly popular and having to wait haha.  My bf and I come almost once a week to get our fix. I'm always torn between the taco salad and one of their chicken paninis. I'm not a vegan so I get regular chicken but they are able to make it vegan if you are. The food is very consistent and comes out every time hot and delicious. The staff is extremely friendly and the owner is always there checking on the customers. Make sure you save room for dessert because it can't be beat. Everything I've tried has been great but I always find myself picking the peanut butter brownie. Mmmm!
1,"Great breakfast spot!\nGet here early on the weekends because it fills up fast. The employees are very friendly and the food is really good. I ordered the Nova Lox Platter consisting of Smoked nova salmon, tomato, onion, cucumber, capers, cream cheese & a toasted bagel. It was divine! The portion is huge and the cost is very fair ($10.95).\nI also tasted the Country Benny with Poached eggs, sausage, biscuit & white country gravy. Amazingly light considering the ingredients.\nThe noise level is pretty high, but it is a great place to start your day.\nThe patio looks great, but it was too hot when I was there..."
1,I never say here but have a lot of events for work... always top noch service and such.
0,"Only reason this place even gets two stars is because the food was pretty good (Cuban sandwich, sun devil club and chipotle chicken pasta were sampled by our party and all were enjoyed) and there is some really cool music and sports memorabilia .  Had the food been terrible, I would have gone zero.  The service was abysmal.  We waited 35 mins for our food and not once did the waiter swing by to check on our drinks or update us on our food time.  \n\nI was in town for a D'backs game and expected a more efficient operation. \n\nThere are better options nearby...pass"
1,"I have no idea where the boyfriend found this place but he suggested for us to go here and we all loved it! \n\nI had the bulgogi and katsu combo and I loved the katsu. It came out hot and crispy. Bulgogi was okay because I was expecting it to be Korean flavored but it wasn't so it threw me off a little. I would go for the teriyaki next time instead because my boyfriend had that and it was amaze-balls  \n\nAll in all, we all enjoyed it and would definitely come back. The service was good and it didn't bother me that the decor was non existent but just wish the place was a little bigger because with all the tables, I felt a little cramped."

I've been in Charlotte 14 years and this is the best place I've found for my eye care, and trust me, I've made the rounds!"
0,"Oh man. I made sure to come back long after my last review. My boyfriend even tried it without me and said that his pizza was good that time. So we come for a later dinner and I hoped the pizza was great. \n\nI wanted to try the smoked salmon pizza and the girl at the counter was stumped at what went on it so she went to ask others. They debated if it had sauce or not. It said it had mozzarella, aioli, etc etc that I read off the menu to them and said I just want what was on the menu. They started talking amongst themselves didn't hear me and then put red sauce on the pizza. Red sauce and smoked salmon doesnt make sense to me and I didn't want it and said that didn't seem right, but they insisted it does....even though they didn't know what was the toppings on it just earlier. They still seemed confused about the pizza so I said \""Can we just get the calabrese pizza instead?\"".  They did know that one so I just rolled with it. There are less than 10 specialty pizzas or make your own creation....I would assume being a pizza maker you would know what goes on the pizzas. \n\nWe ordered also their chopped salad, as that salad is pretty delish. I definitely love that salad and how you can get a little bit of everything in each bite. \n\nThe pizza comes and it's definitely soggy and watery. You can see the pool of it in the picture. It was getting closer to closing and they were cleaning up a bit so I debated if I should return it or not. I tried a bit of my piece and decided it was too soggy to deal with. I walked up and showed them and apologized they were cleaning and getting ready to go home, but it just wasn't okay. The guy was nice enough about it and said it was no problem.\n\nThey refired it and it was better. It was not as good as the BFs last pizza according to him. I suspect it was fired up by that one guy who used to make the pizzas at Parma and our pizza was made by newbies.\n\nThere's a yelp check in for a free cannoli with a pizza purchase. I was distracted so I didnt redeem that, but make sure to check in if you come. \n\nI don't know how to feel. I WANT to like this place is the trouble. It's Chef Marc, it's VPN style pizza, it's by my house and I really like that salad. It's getting good reviews now, some of my friends like it too. It seems WHO makes your pizza makes a difference....they come when Chef is here. It's hard for me to ever come back after this. It must be really inconsistent quality.\n\n It makes me sad to not feel zesty pizza redemption the second time around. I don't get the hype."
0,"I have been getting mani/pedi's for the last 30 years and this was by far the worst I have ever had.  First, I have nevery had a 10 spa pedicure, this woman was so fast and had no attention to detail.  It wasn't like there was anyone else in the place.  She spent almost no time on my feet with a pumice stone, maybe three seconds per foot unless you paid the up-charge for the callus remover.  When I got home I clipped my own toe nails straight as I think she was trying to make them in the shape of a mountain range.  Next time, I will go back to my pretty little nail salon on Northern and 12th and drive the extra couple of miles for a fantastic mani/pedi."

Once you are at the cashier and asked whether you will be paying with your Old Navy credit card...If you say no, they will of course ask you if you want to sign up for one so you can save ten percent...not worth it in my opinion...of course I said no...and the little menopausing twat rolled her eyes at me....and she did it again once I declined to give her my email address ....so bottom line, not impressed with the whole experience, but then again maybe I should lower my expectations with such low prices....."

0,"I received a recommendation to eat here from the driver at my hotel. She loved a specific salad and thought I might enjoy the restaurant. I arrived to a beautiful restaurant with a friendly staff. I moved outside, as the night was warm. I ordered wine and asked the server to return so that I could order my appetizer. The restaurant was virtually empty, but she took a very long time. Eventually, I placed my order. I received my dinner before my appetizer. I ordered the seafood cheese springroll. It was not good. There is no other way to say it. It tasted like cream cheese in a spring roll. The crab and pollack was missing in action. I couldnt finish it and the server never asked me how it was. \n\nThe entree itself, a stirfry dish with panang curry was delicious. It wasnt the best I've tasted, but it was still very good. Now..with my wine glass empty and half of my entree gone, I waited for the server to order more wine. She never came. After 20 minutes, I got up and asked the hostess for my server. The hostess was going home so couldnt help me. I waited a bit more and then asked again for the waitress. After half an hour, a young lady came out and said, I'm sorry but your server went home. \n\nThe manager never came out to explain. No one asked if I needed or wanted anything. She just said, your server went home and gave me a check. I looked at the bill and realized that she had overcharged me. The seafood yuck was on the menu for $8, but she charged me $10. Then, I had to wait for her to call the manager and for him to fix the bill. Still, he did not appear in this very empty restaurant. He called from the back and said I fixed it. He took $5.00 off instead of the overcharge of $2.00. Perhaps this was to placate me. How about, Oh, I'm so sorry that we sent your server home without giving you another server. Oh, you didnt like the seafood springroll, can we get you something else instead. Nothing. \n\nI left the restaurant and determine that I would never go back again. It was definitely below the level of a good restaurant. Below fair as well. I guess this means poor."
0,"I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry."
1,"Whenever I am on that side of town, I always stop by Flea Bag's. The store is very cute and well decorated. The employees are always so kind and willing to help. Dogs are welcome inside, which is very nice. \n\nThe store is small, but is packed with treats, accessories, and toys. I love to browse their collar and toy section whenever  I am there. Items are a bit pricey, but are of good quality. \n\nThe best part is the bakery, by far. My Corgi loves to visit and pick out a special treat for herself. The designs vary each time I am in there store and the treats smell so good I want to try one. Along with every day treats, they also do custom birthday cakes. I bought one for my dog's first birthday and she loved it!! It was gone before any of us knew it. \n\nI would definitely recommend stopping by and bringing your pooch along."
1,The lamb chops are good but it is a little sweet as they are cooked with many fruits. The service is good there.
1,"Been eying this place for awhile but its always sooo packed that I hate waiting  when I'm hungry!  So this Saturday morning we decided to order takeout, ready in 10 minutes= AWESOMENESS! \nThe only complaint I have is my husbands omelette was supposed to be eggwhites but wasn't. EVERYTHING else was DELICIOUS!  You can definitely tell the ingredients were fresh and  homemade! Their bread was sliced thick, OJ was  soooo yummy and the BlackBerry FrenchToast was sweet but with the sourdough bread/zest not overwhelming! Plus the bacon was crispy just the way I love it!\nCannot wait to try something new next time we go! Maybe we'll try lunch next time!"

1,It's great having excellent Chicago nosh here in AZ.  The quality is just as good as back home...actually better since it's in Scottsdale!  Can't go wrong with the Italian beef with hot peppers and don't forget to get it dipped.
0,Don't ever buy the HD and B&J ice cream there. It was so expensive if compare to Traget. Not going back for sure.
1,"The Hofbrauhaus was exactly as it was described, an exact duplicate of the one in Munich (or so I have been told). The service was great. The food was pretty good.  We went for lunch. I had the veal brats, mashed potatoes, and spicy mustard. Had we had more time in Vegas I would have loved to have come back for dinner. The price was high but that's pretty standard for Las Vegas. I would recommend this place for large groups of people."
0,"Okay food but awful service. Restaurant had 5 people in it when my party of three sat down. It took almost an hour for the food to hit the table once we ordered and they didn't offer any sort of compensation. Thai food should not take that long to prepare, this isn't fine dining."
0,"I am adding to my previous review. After several days of calling and leaving messages about the lack of air in my house I finally found Mark's email address and let him now how aggravated I was, first by the fact he didn't return my calls, then by the fact he blocked me from getting through. I then looked for an email address for him online and once I emailed and told him I would report him to the attorney general's office, he finally came out to my house. He said he never got any of my several messages but I phoned him while he stood at my door and let him listen to his own phone telling me the number was blocked. He then proceeded to act like a petulant child the entire time he was there, saying should just leave and not fix the air conditioner. \n\nHe supposedly replaced a bad capacitor that he was carrying on his truck but he didn't have a machine to test the freon on levels. This is standard equipment in air conditioning repair. He had a capacitor for my specific unit but didn't have his freon tester. He said he would be back in a couple of days to check the freon level. Instead of returning he called me from an unavailable number and told me he was going to sure me for slander for giving him a bad review. SLANDER! He obviously has no idea what slander is, and he doesn't understand that it is my right to give my opinion of his horrible service. \n\nI have given Mark a chance to rectify the situation and he has refused, piling lie upon lie in an attempt to hide the fact he has cheated me by not keeping his contract with me and not honoring his commitment. \n\nThis guy is in a customer service business and should do a better job of servicing his customers.\n\nTherefore, I have filed a complaint with the registrar of contractors who have informed me Mark doesn't have a license. The fact he doesn't have a license is not the issue here although you may want to take that into consideration before doing business with him. Unfortunately, I assumed he had a license because he was recommended to me, albeit by his [future] mother-in-law. I never asked him if he had one, and he never offered one either. However, it matters to the ROC when a person is operating without a license and then doesn't honor their commitments. \n\nI now have someone else coming to repair my broken air conditioner. \n\nPlease be very careful before using this guy. He is, as far as I'm concerned, unscrupulous and dishonest. I look forward to working with the ROC to see to it he is rewarded justly for cheating me and being a total douche."
0,So I got a coupon in the mail saying 15$ 0ff 30$ so I decided to try it ...I looked up the menu on the website that had no prices wich is so annoying ....I called and asked prices so I only had to spend so much for only myself ....when I show up the price is twice as much as the lady told me on the phone I told the manager he offered me only garlic bread or a dessert I saw bread in the bag so I chose desert he than didn't even ask me what kind I wanted and he told the waiter to bring me a tiramisu I don't even like chocolate !!!! I get the food home pull out the bread its not even garlic bread wich I had assumed ....what kind of Italian food does not serve garlic bread but just a piece of not toated bagatte ???? On top of paying twice as much on the food I wanted to .... The actual food it's self was cold and incredibly mediocre .... I could have done it better and cheaper by myself!!!! To bad I was lazy .... This place sucks I would never suggest it or go back
0,"don't bother!\n\nI don't even remember why we decided to come to this place. \n\nthe crowd was horrible. the guys totally look like they were from the midwest, the girls were wearing grandma stockings.\n\nfor drinks, stick with beer because the fruity drinks are just plain fruity with no alcohol!\n\nthe only thing that kept me here was the music because the dj was decent. \n\ni wouldn't waste my money and time here, but if you get those free admission tickets and want to kill time, then go for it!"
1,"Really good Mexican food.  I recommend the guacamole and the green chili burro.  Margaritas were OK, but nothing special."
0,"Longest check-in line EVER.  Took us about an hour just to get room keys.  There were maybe 2 people working the front desk.  Clearly understaffed.  \n\nWe wanted recommendations for dinner so I visit the Concierge who was too busy checking her Facebook to be helpful.  No service with a smile.  Made it seem like I was bothering her.  Really??  You have one job.\n\nThe only saving grace was that the rooms were nice.  If you're willing to pay $400/night for crappy service because you just plan on using the room to sleep and don't mind waiting in lines, this is the spot for you."
0,"The pizza here was the only plus.\n\nWe experienced less than mediocre service, my food came out way late - about 15 minutes after the other 5 people at our table received their orders, we had to ask for drink refills at one point, we also had to ask twice to bring out a dipping sauce to go with our tables meals. Once for the sauce, a second time ten minutes later to remind them that it never came to our table. A mistake like burning our pizza and taking an extra 15 + minutes should warrant the floor manager to come to our table and apologize at the very least, which didn't happen.\n\nThe restaurant is setup more like a sports bar than a sit down and enjoy your meal type of pizza spot. Inside is pretty loud, difficult to hear, and hard to hold a conversation due to the distracting TV's playing sports located in every direction. I understand I wasn't in downtown phoenix and perhaps the local clientele expects this sort of place when dining out for pizza, but it surely wasn't for me and I don't plan on visiting again. \n\nAfter all the shortcomings of the service, the kitchen mistake, the management, and the restaurant itself, I did actually enjoy the pizza. It was reasonably tasty, but not worth the $15+ price tag for a personal sized pizza, especially when your dining experience is super lame and uninspiring.\n\nHumble Pie, I know you can do way better than this - I know I'm not the only person who writes of crappy experiences at this place. Apparently you've been giving bad service since you opened doors and haven't taken the hint yet.\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix, might I suggest delivery or perhaps Digiorno?"
0,They probably have good fried food but anything else is just not good. Campbell's clam chowder is better!
1,"Do not let the pretentious look and vibe fool you.  This place has great food.  And unlike what I've heard from other reviewers, the staff is friendly and willing to help in whatever way necessary.  They'll cook it however you want it.  They'll add items or hold items if you want.  They will go out of their way to make your experience great.\n\nEverything we had was amazing.  The shrimp chips and truffle fries were great.  Everyone had a different burger - all were outstanding.  Even my 5-year-old's kids plain cheeseburger was great.  \n\nOne caveat...  If you're anything like my wife and aren't an adventurist eater, stick to the \""build your own burger.\""  You'll get a great burger made how you want it and you won't be disappointed.\n\nIf you're in the area, stop by.  I'm sure you'll love it."
1,"I leapt out of bed in terror at twenty past noon today, thinking I was going to miss the Market because I'd overslept. My day's plans hinged on visiting the Market! In forty minutes I was showered, dressed and out the door, determined to make it for the last leg of the Saturday Farmers' Market.\n\nSo very glad I did - when I got there, mildly lightheaded from dashing out on an empty stomach, I immediately filled up with a coffee from a box conveniently located at the very start (or end?) of the market and a sausage roll from one of the stalls. Revived, I was ready for a good wander and a peer at the wares.\n\nThis market is smaller than I'm used to, but coming from Seattle, where fresh produce and local meats are essentially worth their weight in gold, I'm spoiled. Despite its size, the market has everything you could want - plenty of juicy local meats, fresh-caught seafood, fruit and veg, cheese, honey, soap... trucks from Oink and Well Hung and Tender were also on hand, frying up tasty grub for the lunchtime crowd. Everything is fresh and local, so if you're a discerning shopper, the market is right up your alley. \n\nI'll definitely be back to peruse the wares, and perhaps try more of the ready-made foods. What could be better than eating your lunch, directly from the grocer, in the shadow of the castle?"
0,"Nice decor: If you like neo-Japanese Minimalism.  \n\nAria is very disorganized. We either got cold, impersonal attitudes, or kind people who had absolutely no idea where anything was.  We got more wrong directions from the staff then I have ever gotten in my life. We asked where the name \""Aria\"" came from, and were told \""An Aria is the highest point of a musical crescendo.\"" Huh?  I think he just made that one up, because that one just made me start laughing.\n\nI notice several reviewers defending the Aria, saying that we should give them a break since they just opened.  I beg to differ.  When the Bellagio opened, it was sublime and perfect, and still is.  Aria was just this side of a disaster.  Why would you open at Christmas time and not put up a single decoration? Why would you open before the staff knows anything about the property? Why would you open before the housekeeping staff knows how to clean a room before letting a guest check in? It is a beautiful (albeit cold)  property, and I hope they get it together but it was a complete failure of a grand opening.  I'll take the Bellagio any day of the year over Aria."

0,"I'll come out and say it, the only reason I go to this place is for the beds.  They have a great selection of UWE beds which are by far some of the nicest beds on the market.  Their level of customer service is non-existent and pricing is a little spendy but you can get more bang for your buck if you figure out which bed works best for you.\n\nYou basically have one option, pay $18.88 a month to be a \""member.\""  This gets you unlimited tans in their entry level bed which is your basic 1980's style tanning bed.  If you want to use levels 2-5 beds you have to pay an upgrade fee of $5-20.  Here is where it gets tricky.  If you prepay a set amount ranging from $25-200, you get discounted upgrade fees for each level.  The more you prepay, the cheaper the upgrade fee is.  They have a board that outlines each fee behind the counter so if you have 30 minutes to kill, take a gander at it and try to figure out what you are paying per tan.  Oh and your $18.88 a month is only good at one location, if you want to be able to tan at any Darque location, better up that monthly fee to $22.\n\nI do like the fact that they allow you a pro-rated upgrade fee if you do not go the full max time for each bed.  This is how I save some $$ since I often have a few weeks between sessions and can't go the full time.  The bad news is you have to be a member and have a prepaid balance on your account to get the prorated amount.  The place is always very very clean, they employ a bed cleaner who does a great job!  The AC system keeps it subzero in the building and I have seen them change the bulbs a couple times since I became a member.  They also have a shower in one of their bathrooms incase you are pressed for time but make sure you bring your own towel, they don't provide any.\n\nIf you Mystic tan, this place is a bargain.  I believe the lowest prepaid level of $25 starts Mystic at $15-17 a session which is unheard of here in the valley.\n\nThe reason I gave this place 2 stars is their staff.  They have young girls behind the counter that have no idea what customer service is.  They will have a line of members out the door while they enter in the information of some college kid who just wants their week of free tanning.  They are quick to try to up sell you lotion, a larger package amount or teeth whiteners but slow to get off their personal call while you wait for them to check you in.  If you ask them a question you will get a blank stare and 9 times out of ten their answer will be the priciest thing they have there.  My personal fav?  Their posted close times are 8 or 11 PM but don't tell you that you can't tan if you get there 30 minutes before close so don't bust your butt to get there because you WILL be turned away."
1,"Yum yum yum! Beer is amazing- not one I couldn't drink a couple pints of. Comfortable, welcoming atmosphere. Would like to see a couple more things for food- not interested in having pizza bread as an appetizer if the only entree choice is pizza. Overall, would come back again in hopes that the menu will diversify."
0,"I have traveled regularly on BA, this time we were awaiting guests who began their flight in Rome connecting thru in London on BA to Phoenix.  If your reputation is based not on how you handle things when things run smoothly, but when things go awry,  then BA is in trouble.\n\nThe 3 guests arrived but not one piece of baggage (4pcs). Customer service at the airport said \""wait\"" apparently thinking that the bags would materialize... nearly 2 hrs later, with a promise that the bags would be delivered, a BA employee explained that there was an IT problem and that several hundred bags were not where they were supposed to be. \n\nOne of our guests was a visiting Prof, teaching a class for a semester at ASU. Needless to say not having any of her clothes, or teaching materials was a disaster. \n\nThe next morning we contacted the BA \""lost baggage number,\"" answered by someone barely understandable, who explained that the bags were now at the airport and we could pick them up. We went to the airport only to be told \""oh, you must have talked to the call center in India, they have no idea what's going on, I don't know why they tell people to come to the airport!\""  You have no idea? Maybe it's because they're contracted by BA and instructed to do so!\n\nWe learned that BA \""contracts\"" a local service to deliver the bags but we \""have to be patient because the company is a small company and there are hundreds of bags.\"" Excuse me? We have to be patient because you (BA) contracted with a company not up to the job? \n\nEach day we returned to the airport....we also called the \""call center\""  and they  provided incorrect information each and every time; telling us each day that the delivery service had our bags and would deliver them that night \""but if they didn't we should call back the next day.\"" \n\nThe website to which we were referred was equally useless listing the bags as 3 black bags (2 were light blue 1 was yellow) and showing a beige baby stroller as black. When we spoke to the customer service person at the airport, she explained that with all the bags that were misdirected the staff in London didn't have time to put \""colors in the system, they just labeled everything 'black.'  Could BA be less efficient or effective? \n\nTwo of the bags arrived at midnight one week later, the last bag and baby stroller at 11:00 pm the next night. \n\nThe staff was clearly stressed, all were as pleasant as possible but British Air could not have been more inept and their staff more ill informed."

Not bad-it was weird that there was a special \""only if you pay extra\"" section of the salad bar that had the good stuff like chicken and artichoke hearts for a few extra bucks, but it ended up not mattering because we went for the 2 meals for 20 dollars route.\nIt was fine-and the Greek Lemon soup was actually good. We were there right before it closed and a person working there gave us each a bag of chocolate chip cookies for free at the end of the night. That was nice."

1,"We stayed at Treasure Island on New Year's Eve and had a great experience.  Yes, checkout was slow, but they kept bringing more employees out to speed up the process.  Checkout was easy because we had already paid for everything.  The bell service brought our bags to our room for us because they had been holding them before we could check in.  Great service!\n\nThe room was awesome!  Amazing blackout curtains, incredibly comfortable bed, and a perfect soaking tub!  Also had a real hair dryer...not a cheap one attached to the wall.  Everything was clean, and we had no problems with the room.\n\nThe experience at TI was okay.  To be honest, we did go to other casinos to gamble or walk around, but TI is so close to the Mirage, Venetian, and Bellagio that it wasn't a big deal.  For New Year's Eve, fireworks were shot off the TI, so we had a great view!  \n\nI would definitely stay here again!"
1,"This place is great! I've dined in and gotten take out from them several times and have yet to order something I didn't like. \n\nMy favorite has got to be the green curry noodles with chicken! I crave their green curry and order it pretty much every time I eat here. The short ribs appetizer is also delicious. I've had a variety of the items from their menu and was not disappointed by any of them!\n\nI went recently with a large group 8+ people. I called ahead and they had very nicely arranged the tables in the center of the restaurant to accommodate all of us. Plus, the staff was incredible. Our \""waiter\"" was the owner and he checked on/chatted with us and even brought out his mother, the chef. It just made the whole experience even better knowing this nice family was running the restaurant together. \n\nI'm not sure why this place is empty every time I go in because it really is a wonderful place to eat! But at least you know you'll never have long wait times, like most places in the Southside."

0,"After dealing with a two week long migraine and severe pressure and pain in my face, I called around looking for an ENT that could get me in ASAP. Dr. Simms was available for a same day appointment and I scheduled with him for that afternoon. The wait time itself wasn't bad - 10-15 minutes after completing paperwork. \n\nDr. Simms was personable enough and after evaluating me, told me that he would like to treat for a sinus infection with antibiotics and prednisone. As I had just moved and newly became a student, I didn't yet have health insurance set up. Dr. Simms told me to give him a call the following week if the symptoms didn't subside after I was done with the meds, and he would prescribe an alternate antibiotic.\n\nI ended up going to a dental Urgent Care two days later on a Saturday because I woke up with immense pain and pressure in my tooth. An x-ray confirmed a sinus infection and I was told to follow up with my ENT on Monday. I called Monday morning and left a message for Dr. Simms. I called Tuesday and left another message since no one had called me back and I was in pain. Tuesday night, Dr. Simms' medical assistant called me back and told me that I had to come in to get a CT scan. I inquired about getting an additional rx for antibiotics as well as asked to discuss this with Dr. Simms directly. That request was ignored and I was told that she would attempt to book me for a CT scan and call back.\n\nTwo days later, I hadn't heard back and I called to leave another message. I was told that the medical assistant I spoke with no longer works there, so the receptionist or nurse had no idea what I was talking about. She told me she took down the message and I would get a call back. I stopped by the office later that day to drop off a copy of my x-ray and asked if Dr. Simms was in and if I could chat with him for a moment. I was told he was seeing patients and couldn't talk to me. Understandable, however I was willing to wait to get a word in with him. I was told again he wasn't available. When I explained the situation and that I had been struggling with this for three weeks and haven't been able to get a hold of him for a week at this point, the nurse/receptionist just shrugged.  I asked her to please have him call me specifically as I wanted to talk to my doctor directly. She told me someone would call me later. When I again insisted on a call from him specifically, she rudely told me again that \""*someone* will call\"". \n\nI took my x-ray, booked an appt at a different office and left. I've never experienced such cold and indifferent treatment at a doctor's office. Who wants to be treated by a doctor who doesn't return calls and whose front office staff is rude and uncaring both in person and on the phone? If you want someone reliable who will make you feel like you are a valued patient, go elsewhere!!!"
0,"This place is over rated too, got here for dinner, not a lot of variety, not worth it! The only thing good there was the Pepsi and juices. Wouldn't come here again."
1,"I am a really big fan of this Bikram studio.  I have to say they do a really good job of making everyone feel invited and comfortable.  I actually found the studio to be spacious but they may be because I have not been there when it is incredibly packed.  I also had never been there prior to the remodel.\n\nTeachers all learn your name when you walk in and they use it in class.  I LOVE this touch, makes me feel welcomed and I appreciate my name being used to assist me in correcting form and showing me modifications.\n\nI really feel as the teacher is very engaged with the students taking the time to walk around, correct, give kudos and be there if needed.  Savasana is never rushed at the end.  They have staggered the classes to allow enough time.  I will say that I have never considered really practicing yoga until I came here.\n\nLocker rooms are small but they work with the space and I feel comfortable leaving my items in the locker room, if they have run out of lockers.  There is only one shower, however not many people use it post workout and those that do are quick quick, so you may wait 5 mins tops.\n\nOverall, I am a fan and will continue to be a patron of this studio"

1,"What a great bakery.  The breads are fantastic as well as some of their specialty baked goods.  They even have spiral rolls with spinach, cheese, etc. fillings, something like Spanakopeta, but individual.  They have a nice selection of individual sweet bakery items.  They remind so much of Greek food, especially since I make a large batch of Spanakopeta a few times a year.  Their food is great and so reasonable."
0,"I'm really torn on what rating to give this place. First off, we stayed here on a Friday, which happened to be the first night of EDC.

I know this is isn't there fault and they did everything they could to remedy the situation (free drinks, snacks, etc.) So my issue isn't really this. My issue is more about the aftermath of the day (i.e. my credit card bill) \n\nBecause of the 2 hour wait, my friend was able to convince the front desk lady to give him a bit of a discount. She supposedly gave us $100 dollars off. Sounds awesome right? Well not when you end up being overcharged $82 on your credit card bill 5 days later. So when we checked out of the hotel, the computers must have still be down because we couldn't check out through our TV and there was no way in hell I was going to go wait in line for another 1 or 2 just to check out. Instead, I called down to the front desk, waited on hold for about 20 minutes and finally checked out. Since I did this, I wasn't able to see my bill because they were going to email it to me. Well the last thing I want to do in Vegas is check my email and worry about work so I waited until I got home to check my bill.\n\nWe were given the $100 discount but they then charged us $30 for a late check out fee, even though we specifically booked through a promotion saying we are supposed to check out at 4:00 p.m. (this was also confirmed on the day of check in) So basically we were only overcharged $30. No big deal, I thought it would be a quick fix. \n\nI call Mandalay Bay to get a credit back on my card. Apparently I have to talk to the accounting department. I end up on hold for AN HOUR!!! No one picks up. Are you kidding me? An hour?? I then decide to email the accounting department. I have not gotten a response to date.  I then call the accounting department again two days later. Another ridiculously long hold. I then call the  front desk and explain to them that there is a problem on my bill and she says she'll try to fix it for me. Big mistake. She ended up correctly charging my credit card but then she charged my friends card $82!! (his card was on file because he checked in and used his card for incidentals) I have no idea where that amount came from and they did not have permission to charge his card. Now he can't get a hold of the accounting department to get a credit on his card. \n\nIf this didn't happen, I would have given the hotel 4 stars. Rooms were clean. Service was decent. Good restaurant options. Awesome pool. But giving me a discount and then overcharging my card and my friends card? Unacceptable."
0,"The drunk chick dancing to the music outside the Cosmopolitan can dance better than any of these ladies.  You could tell by their expressions they were doing a routine they had memorized or were just learning. \n\nBad seating unless you were right upfront.  Who is the idiot that thought if you split the room in half and have guests looking at each other instead of the stage, was the way to seat people at a T&A show??   They had great music, just too loud for that small of a room.\n\nUsually a scene with two ladies in a bathtub is hot. They made it out to be boring and cheesy.  Only one lady know what that gold pole in the middle of the room was for and how to use it.  \n\nWe saw it EDC weekend. so there were much sexier women outside for free.  Its bad when your girlfriend looks at you and says she has seen better!\n\nNot going back"
0,"This is a great \""scene\"" but the food was not that great... I had the filet and it was not  very tender and didnt have great flavor... but the wings were great... I think the apps are better than the dinner menu!  \nThe patio rocks!!"
1,"Kathy is the best, she knows how to cut every kind of hair.she is really expert in her job. She is a socialize person and each time we talk together. Today was my third time and each time I tried different style and each time I was satisfy.."
0,"This is not about the UPS shipping but rather their Printing Services.\n\nIt was bad. The copiers do not scan or take USB ($2 + wait to have them scan), you cannot connect your computer to print (like many FedEx), and it is $0.10 a min to go on a computer.\n\nMaybe I've been spoiled because I usually use FedEx's services, but I had to leave. It was annoying that the equipment had the technology to be efficient, less cost to the costumer, and faster but it was never networked properly.\n\nI needed to print from USB, sign, scan, and collect files to email. It would have taken too long and I wasn't about to pay more for worse service than I can find elsewhere."
0,"Doesn't even taste like pho, nor smell like it.\n\nI had asked for extra veggies in my vermicelli, and it looked like they put in less than most places normally would if i had not asked for extra. This plate was ok.\n\nMy seat had a bunch of rips in it, and when you sit on ripped leather it kinda hurts if you wear a dress/shorts."
1,This stadium is an absolute gem. However the city of Mesa should really push hard to get a minor league team here. Shame to see such a nice stadium used so infrequently.
0,"Found it comical that the music being played was intended to mimic a live, scratching DJ though there wasn't one to be found.\n\nThe table we sat at was ready to collapse--and this place is relatively new to the Hard Rock.  \n\nBeer list is small.  Prices are high.  Service is ok.  I like the look of it, but I'm not pining to go back."
0,"I would give this place 2.5 stars. I kept coming across specials for a $29 full set of individual lashes on multiple social media sites so I thought I would give it a shot. They lost there first star due to the waiting time, my appointment was made for 330pm and was told to arrive early at 315pm. I made sure I arrived at this time due to there strict rules of being on time. However when I arrived there was a sign on the door saying they would return at 330 ( they actually got there at 335pm) leaving me to wait outside in 100plus degrees. I also work in customer service so I know these things happen but when you preach to be on time to others you should be as well.  The second star was lost due to the quality of lashes, the actual look was awesome but the only lasted a week and most of the time fall out in clumps of 2 or 3 so I feel they could have been applied better and lasted longer. The last half of a star was deducted was for the price paid, the inital deal of $29 is ok but wish they lasted at least 2 weeks, but I would never pay membership price to have them refilled every week."
0,"Came here for some egg nog. As famous as it is, I guess I prefer homemade egg nog of the custard-y variety. There wasn't enough \""egg-y-ness\"" in it and I felt that the alcohol overpowered the drink.\n\nService was a little hit/miss. Our waitress was friendly enough, but she disappeared for over half an hour when we wanted to order something else."
1,"This Mediterranean restaurant has a really great weekend buffet, as Rand H., Mike C. found out during our buffet excursion here. I started the meal with a mild but tasty lentil soup, then went on to a refreshing parsley salad, savory meatballs, tasty vegetable dishes (vegetarians will like this place for sure) ... and the *best* shawarma I've ever had!  And just when I thought it couldn't get any better, as I was paying for the meal I noticed trays of tempting baklava near the cashier (sneaky!) ... these came in almond, walnut and pistachio, and I just had to try the pistachio one. It was pure heaven, buttery goodness with an abundance of crushed pistachio and dripping with honey -- an awesome finish to an amazing meal."
0,"If crappy is cool than why aren't 3rd World countries flooded with hipsters?, I went to this spot because a band I liked was playing (smile empty soul) The plaza it's located in is shady. They took the name and literally applied it. The crowd that night was a mix of hipster douche, along with frat boy mc douchenstein . There's a pretty cute bartender among the gargoyles. Drinks are fairly cheap service was kinda slow even though they weren't busy. It's a relatively small space so when it gets crowded it's kinda shoulder to shoulder. The PA system was pretty good. The set changes were pretty quick. I probably wouldn't frequent this joint unless there was an event i really admired going on."
1,"Earl of Sandwich is @ Planet Hollywood.\n\nTried the Full Montagu sandwich and was not hungry after that.  Really big portion.  Full Montagu is - Freshly Roasted Beef, Turkey, Aged Swiss & Sharp Cheddar, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & the Earl's Mustard Sauce.  Pretty darn good.  Shared a salad - the Caprese Salad - \nField Greens & Romaine, Fresh Mozzarella Cheese, Roma Tomato, Fresh Basil & Balsamic Vinaigrette.  Very fresh salad."
0,"Buyer beware! Trust me, you dont want to bring your car here. Myself along with other people I soon learned about, have had HORRIBLE experiences. They will lie right to your face. I had over $1000 worth of work done to my car and the problem was still there. After I brought it in for a 3rd time and they told me it would be another $800 I decided to just go back to the dealership. The dealership told me, it was not what they had repaired nor what they said would be the 3rd thing. It was the original problem I had told Fletchers about. It is really sad how poor their customer service was. Corporate is even worse and lied to my face about EVERYTHING! Please do NOT go there. I am telling you, you will regret it. I sure do, over $2000 more to replace a $1000 job. BUYER BEWARE!!! I wish I could rate this ZERO stars but I can't."
1,"My daughter was visiting from Fairbanks, AK and her one year old twins came down with an upper respiratory flu type illness.  Because they are covered by Tri-Care, we were told to take them to the nearest hospital, which happened to be Scottsdale Healthcare.\n\nI went with her to emergency, holding one of the twins.  We were promptly greeted by the front desk, and histories were taken.  They also took a blood test to see the oxygen content of the children's blood. After about a 15 minute wait for test results, we were seen by one of the emergency room physicians.  He discussed his findings with us in detail, the plus and minus of different treatment modalities, and his recommendations.  I am a healthcare professional, but my daughter isn't, and she had several questions, which he explained clearly and patiently.  \n\nAlso delightful was the person taking the insurance information (which did not happen until we were almost done).  He was personable, and obviously delighted with children, as he spent more time playing with them, than getting the information from my daughter.\n\nIt was a very pleasant experience, and it actually took less time for the emergency room visit, than to get their prescriptions filled.  I might note that it wasn't particularly busy that night, so it might be different if they are swamped.\n\nOf course, I did manage to catch what the grandchildren had - aren't kids great!!"
1,"I had the opportunity to go to Which Wich on a recent Saturday afternoon, and my first impressions of Which Which are mostly positive.\n\nWhat I like most about Which Wich is the uniqueness of the joint.  The whole order via circling your choices on a pad with a pencil; ordering format works, and reminds me of a burrito-joint in Chapel Hill by the name of Armadillo Grill.  I like that there really are no set, pre-made subs.  Everything is made fresh to order and is tailored to your specific topping and sauce needs.  \n\nI will say that the parking lot was a little hectic and the inside felt a bit chaotic as well.  There weren't many available seats and it looked like the Tasmanian Devil had just run through the place.\n\nAs far as the actual taste of my sub, it was excellent.  All the ingredients tasted fresh and my sandwich was made to my specifications.\n\nDespite the interior, the service was excellent and the sub tasted good enough that I  would def like to return to Which Wich again, perhaps giving the location at the MET a shot."
1,"First time here and we'll be back. \n\nWe both got the 1/4 chicken and 2 sides - rice, canary beans(?), yucca, plantains. And Sangria. \n\nPros: With the exception of the beans, everything was really good (+ Sangria). Comes with 2 sauces which were also very good.\n\nCons: Beans were average. But there are other sides to try out."
0,"Very unprofessional. They have unclear and unprofressional business policies. Did not accept company check from another tow yard, was not told this untill we made the 5 hour drive to pick up a vehicle. Office personell are very unhelpful. When our business owner called to talk to a supervisor they said it is business policy that no one can speak to a supervisor. Horrible business."
0,The Standard Burger tasted good but definitely not worth $4.95.  The two beef patties were small and overcooked.\n\nThe fresh cut french fries was really good.\n\nI also had the short rib taco and I was probably the driest short rib I have ever had.  There was no moisture content in the meat at all.  I couldn't even finish it because the texture was so unappealing.\n\nPretty disappointing considering all the praise on yelp.
1,"When I come home to Arizona this is always my first stop for a  meal/snack when I get off the plane!  There are no Jack in the Box restaurants in VA, so this is always a nice treat.  I've never had issues with food or customer service.  More details coming soon!"
1,"Fat Choy is such a neat little oddity in the Eureka Casino. I ate there with two friends and we shared everything. The only miss were the dumplings. Anything with duck in it was grand. The Fat Choy Burger was delightful. As far as adult beverages, FC only serves beer, but there is a full bar right outside the restaurant, and our server had no problem with us bringing in beverages from there. Which makes you think it would be quite easy to be a little sneaky and BYOB. Overall, FC is great, cheap option in a head-scratching location."
1,"I was lucky enough to get two tickets to the opening night of Giselle. What a beautiful performance. The scenery was beautiful, the dancers were great, the story was easy to follow for those of us who don't have training, overall it was amazing. This production made me want to go to the ballet again and again! Very professional and very entertaining."
1,"Peperonata, mascarpone fritter, goat cheese appetizer was very refreshing (yummy peppers) and Red Tuna Boris Style was very good. Recommend outdoor seating when you visit - beautiful terrasse makes for great ambience! Good cocktails as well - had the Boris style mojito."
0,"The world could use more small-time museums, but it's a tough road for those with modest endowments and only a niche market. One thing that cartooning has going for it, however, is that it lends itself very nicely to a gallery space. Toonseum is not very big, but I enjoyed my one visit here.\n\nThat said, in 2011 I contributed to a modest Kickstarter campaign they promoted to help raise funds for a new gallery, and judging by the comments on their Kickstarter page, I am pretty sure I wasn't the only backer that wasn't sent a promised reward. Subsequent messages went unanswered. That left a pretty sour taste in my mouth. Someone in the organization really laid an egg."
1,"Found this place about 15 years ago.  You guessed right....a referral.  Been referring and using ever since.  This is a no nonsense - CUSTOMER SERVICE oriented family business.  The staff is the same since the original trip.  \n\nIf you are looking for fair pricing, personal service and no \""extra\"" suggested  upselling, this is a great place for you.  Wouldnt even think of taking my vehicles anywhere else.  Special thanks to this staff that goes out of their way for the little things too."
1,"Menu is fabulous different variations of standard breakfasts' dishes.  Homemade biscuits and jams. Perfectly prepared egg dishes. Light fluffy pancakes. I had the fresh blueberry pancakes...perfect!  Not your tiny coffee cup, no, no. A real coffee mug. Family operated. Warm, friendly fast service. Will be back again!"
0,"This place is a serious joke of a \""coffee house\""!\n\nWe came here because my sister had a hair appointment at Altered Ego, the [very] popular hair salon next door. After reading the 5 star reviews, we thought this would be a nice place to hang out while waiting for the hairdresser (before and during my sisters salon visit).\n\nThe outside looks inviting, a glass door with Solo Caf\u00e9 in bold white letters (and other various stickers on the door) and two small patio tables and chairs outside. With Altered Ego next door, we thought it would be equally bright and airy like the salon. At first I was reminded of the small boutiques in downtown San Luis Obispo, CA!\n\nSo, appearances really ARE deceiving!\n\nWe walked in around 12:35pm, and if it weren't for the 7, 5yr old Apple Laptops Apple logo illuminating the shop, you could have sworn you walked into a dirty-looking dungeon. It's filled with college kids abusing the free WiFi, the drinks are overpriced and customer service is seriously lacking. And I totally agree with what others have said about \""Zombie Hipsters\"", if you need them, they're here.\n\nThe decor is pretty bad. It looks like they started with an India theme turned Bohemian, turned goth, and tried real hard to turn modern but failed miserably. Ambiance is not there whatsoever, when I walked in everyone in the place looked at me (silently judging, anyone?) then turned their attention back to their laptop screens. Since the place isn't lit very well (hence the 7 Apple icons lighting up the entire place like nightlights), it's like a shop that serves you great coffee while you can watch porn on your laptop and no one can see your face properly and recognize you (lol).\n\nThe tables and booths crowd the entire floor, there is a small common sitting area with a dingy looking couch and cushions, no one was sitting in it and it was obviously just taking up space. Standing around while waiting for the customer in front of us to order (who apparently couldn't make up her mind on WHAT to order), we ended up bumping into other customers who were getting up to talk to their friends, or other customers who entered and were waiting in line behind us. You're seriously bumping elbows here.\n\nThe woman at the cashier had the rudest attitude I've ever met at a coffee house! She had a bored look on her face that seriously said, \""I don't f***ing want to be here right now.\"" Their menu sits in the far back on the right hand wall, there are NO lights highlighting the menu or any of their teas (in which you'd think they'd be proud to show off since it looks like fresh homegrown and dried tea leaves). She didn't greet us when we walked up to order after the first customer, and just stared at us like she was staring at a wall.\n\nWe wanted Italian Sodas since it's a pretty warm day, and they sounded real nice to have. She blatantly said, \""We don't have ANY Italian Soda today.\"" like we were out of the loop and we should've obviously known there was no Soda water today! Wow, I was pretty shocked at her reply, and was pretty shocked when she looked over her shoulder at the Barista and said, \""I've been turning away 20 customers because we don't have ANY soda water.\"" and the guy shrugged, like he can do something about it? He's making the coffee's! It's a Saturday afternoon, and you don't even have the proper ingredients stocked and then in the middle of helping customers tell the Barista that you're out of said ingredient in front of everyone in the coffee house. When we asked what teas they had, she drawled out, \""Whatever we have is on the wall.\"" and we were seriously caught off guard, said an uncertain, \""Oh... okay...\"" and ordered.\n\nSister ordered a White Chocolate Mocha, she liked it but wished there were more for the price she paid (I'm guessing whipped cream since she's a girly girl and likes those types of drinks). My mother ordered a Cranberry Breeze Iced Tea which was really good. But not even the good coffee and iced tea could make me give this place 2 stars.\n\nI was turned off once the woman gave us each a surveying look. Didn't order anything and walked outside because of this place, I was trying really hard not to laugh in her face because of the sh*tastic service we were getting. The small coffee bar wasn't even cleaned or the trash thrown out.\n\nI would seriously save my time and money and go to the coffee house on Southern and McClintock (across the plaza from Sunflower Market) for a better atmosphere, clean tables and chairs, and a more enjoyable staff than this place."
0,DON'T LET THE FACT THAT I GOT A RESPONSE ON MY REVIEW AS ANY SIGN OF DECENT CUSTOMER SERVICE OR CONCERN.  IT JUST LOOKS LIKE THEY GIVE A CRAP- BUT AS PREVIOUSLY STATED- THEY DON'T!!!!\n\nIT'S BEEN 3 WEEKS- guess you didn't care enough to make things right!!!!!
0,Recently renovated but my room was not completed and ac did not function properly.    The lounge is nice touch but not enough to overcome the staffs lack of detail and follow through.    Will give this place one last shot but not holding me breath
0,"The worst!  Weird decor and atmosphere. Food, blech!"
1,"I must admit, the food at St Francis is top notch, although the experience is a bit pretentious.  \n\nGoing there for happy hour is a must, as the prices are very reasonable. The menu is limited, but more than sufficient.  \n\nI had the chicken salad, at the recommendation of the bar tender.  It was quite good.  While it comes with either fries or salad, upgrade to the fingerling potatoes ($2) which were perfect in every way. \n\nThe drinks were poured with a liberal hand and the wine selection was very good.\n\nThere are many beautiful people there.  It is a bit off-putting, but the food is worth the trade-off."
1,They say what you see is what you get and after seeing her amazing hair and makeup I knew I had to have her do my makeup/hair for my wedding. She was absolutely amazing!!!
1,"Being from Hawaii, I have high expectations for shave ice. I am really glad I found this place! It's almost comparable to Hawaii's shave ice plus they have over 70 flavors to choose from. With all the different flavors, it's really overwhelming to decide which one to get. The workers there are nice and will let you sample the flavors you want. \nI love their fruity flavors like melon and raspberry! Also being from Hawaii, what's shave ice without some condensed milk? Bahama Buck's has something similar to condensed milk and it tastes the same. I recommend this place to anyone who wants good quality shave ice."
1,"For my 100th review, I figured I'd review one of my favorite PGH attractions: the Gateway Clipper fleet.  For Valentine's Day, I went on a cruise on the Duchess, and it was a really wonderful, unique way to spend my first non-single V-Day. Although my now-ex bf and I have since split, this does little to diminish my fond memories of the cruise!\n\nI believe we set sail around 7:30pm, and we floated up the Mon past the Hot Metal Bridge, then up the Allegheny past the 40th St. bridge, then finally down the Ohio for the longest leg of the trip.  During this time, we enjoyed a buffet dinner, a raffle, and then dancing to live music.  Sure, the food wasn't up to the standard of the type of restaurant I'd pick for a special occasion such as V-Day (given that I'm a foodie...), nor was the band as good as one I'd hire for a wedding, but the experience was a pleasurable gestalt, in that the sum was greater than its parts. The ex and I had a great time conversing with other couples at our table, enjoying the scenery from the river, and then busting some moves on the dance floor. Although it was quite cold, given that it was the middle of Feb., towards the end of the ride, when the boat was headed back to Station Square, we went up to the deck to get some fresh air and take in the scenery of nocturnal downtown PGH. Although the trip had been my suggestion, I definitely felt loved that he'd do it for me, since it's not cheap ($60/person, if I recall).\n\nBased on my experience, I'd highly recommend the Gateway Clipper as a unique way to celebrate special holidays, such as V-Day, New Year's, or Light Up Night.  If you do decide to give it a try, be sure to book early, since, needless to say, it's very popular during these holidays.  I'd love to try it again during the warmer months, so that I could enjoy the view without freezing on deck.  The Gateway Clipper is definitely a one-of-a-kind way to see PGH and to celebrate special occasions!"
1,Hey not too shabby though our waitress was kinda cranky. But you probably would be too if you worked around cheapskates like me for the past 35 years. \n\nDefinitely an adventure and worth the hike. No we did not get sick. Would go back again.
1,"Helped with my anniversary! They only take cash, which I did not bring :( She made me a bouquet anyway, let me take it home and said I could come back and pay her tomorrow! You just don't get customer service like that anymore! Awesome experience!!!"
1,"Where is the 10 star rating????\n\nI have been to komex but none of my friends have, because we do not live around there. BUT it IS so worth the drive!!! I took my friend after a day of shopping. I think she was a little freaked out by the sketchy hood. I ordered a bunch of different things to share. Wonton soup, flautas, musubi, tacos, fish tacos and a torta to go for hubby. All that plus tax and tip was $40.  Sooooo much food!!!! It was ALL fantastic.\n\nBesides the TERRIFIC food, I like that you can get a variety of different things. I had never had musubi, cuz I hate spam, but it was good. But then I am able to get the Mexi food that hubby so loves. It is PERFECT! I wish I lived closer, LOL."
1,Food was great and so was the service. Sylvia herself was working tonight and made sure everyone was greeted promptly and was taken care of. The servers-not just ours but all of them were friendly and stopped by our take multiple times to check to see if we needed anything. They had a live band playing and they were pretty good. This was the first time in many months that we had been here and the remodeling they had done is amazing. The decor is beautiful and they really improved the look of the restaurant. Over we had a wonderful experience.
0,Double check your deposit and your cash. I have received counterfeit money and my deposits were short a few times once you leave they won't help you. Use another branch.
0,"Wow, I've been here before but couldn't remember the why I did not like coming here. Came here today for lunch and now I remember...Stingy Rude owners! Wow can I get a word in when I order, the female would not let me talk and then had the nerve to talk on the phone when I tried to order. \nIf you want to order for me I think you should pay as well... part of customer service is actually listening to the customer.\nI won't be back, food is ok."
0,"Room: We were put in a room on the 3rd floor all the day at the end of the hallway facing the highway. I am pregnant and a light sleeper and that wasn't gonna suffice.  So I called the front desk where they told me my only other option was a 2 queen bed room, no more kings.  Hard to believe because the resort seemed deserted.  But we took it.  That was annoying. \nAlso, in both rooms we were in, the mini bar price list was completely out of date.  There were several items on both mini bars that were not even listed on the list.  I wanted these items but had no idea I would be bogusly charged for them so I didn't indulge.  Disappointing. \nThe powering washing each night of the pool area, VERY obnoxious.  Can this not be done after the pool closes when everyone is at dinner?  1. I could hear it from our room when we went to bed early. 2. The next night we went to the hot tub and they were power washing all around us and it was very obnoxious and loud.  Terrible. \nNext, the steakhouse experience.  VERY disappointed in how that turned out. \nAlso, our last morning my husband went down to starbucks to get my an ice water.  He also ordered himself a coffee but he forgot his ID/wallet because he was just going to do a room charge.  We stayed at The Aria the 2 nights prior to coming here and didn't need our ID's for the room charges.  So we weren't used to it.  Well he didn't have his ID so he just asked them for the water for his pregnant wife and to forget the coffee.  They said no because the water was $.27, not free.  Are you kidding me?!  The resort can't spare $.27 as a courtesy to this EXTREME INCONVENIENCE after  a 10-15 minute round trip walk?  So he had to walk all the way back up to our room for his ID just to get me water.  He even asked if he could txt me and ask me to send a picture of his ID to show the cashier and he said no.  How absurd.  All for $.27 for the pregnant lady."
1,Really impressed with the show. We sat in section 104 & the seats were really great. We were able to see the entire show up close. \n\nThe sensuality & comedy mix is perfect. \n\nDon't sit in the front if you're a shy person. You may get picked on my the cast. \n\nI would recommend this show for any open minded couple. Date night approved!
1,If you haven't heard about this phenomenon North Las Vegas it's about time you hear about it. The old plain movie theater at the cannery has now turned into a luxury movie theater. What this means is you pick your seats and each one is a huge recliner. It is amazing I went there last night and I saw a sign that says they're going to be doing old movies on Sundays throughout the year. Now old means old for our generation like for example in August they're doing the breakfast club in October they're doing Ferris Beullers day off.  In December they're doing home alone. Doesn't that sound like fun???
1,"On a good day with the wind blowing from the South East I can smell the meat smoking all the way in North Phoenix..... \n\nOk, only in my head I can.  Every time I find my self remotely close to Joe's I have to stop in for some meat, rootbeer, and any one of the amazing side dishes.  \n\nGreat Staff\nGreat Food\nGreat Atmosphere"
0,"The Porch was a welcomed addition to the space near the Cathedral of Learning for going out after academic talks or taking visiting scholars to a nice lunch in a good-looking place nearby. The food was good enough although limited (as many other reviewers have pointed out), and the drinks are excellent and they have a variety of beers available. \n\nThis place has gone downhill since it first opened, however -- particularly the service. I have only had one server in this place do even a halfway decent job, and I think he was actually a dishwasher or cook filling in for a server during a desolate lunch shift. Every other time, the server takes upwards of 20 minutes to bring drinks, it's like pulling teeth to get a pitcher of water delivered to the table, and forget about asking for refills or silverware or condiments -- they'll stop by the table and only take one person's request, then disappear for another 20 minutes, after which you'll need to remind them of your request. \n\nThe most disappointing thing happened just yesterday, when one server who was working a dinner/happy hour service announced that she was sick with the flu that's been going around as she delivered my colleague's salad to the table. I feel bad for the woman for being sick and working through it, of course, but perhaps management should allow their sick employees to take nights off so they don't feel the need to announce their misery to their customers. \n\nIn short, the service in this place is so bad that the food doesn't even make it worth going. However, it remains the closest and most viable option for many academics in the area, and I think that is the sole reason this place will continue to survive."
1,"Amazing Indian food. I am originally from the UK, where you can get amazing Indian in virtually every city, town and village! \nHere in the US, not so much. Its hard to find Indian food that isnt overpriced. \n\nThe Dhaba seem to have it all covered, great food, good service and fairly priced. We managed to get a Groupon to save a little more too. \n\nThe naan bread was a highlight, very light and not doughy at all. We both had chicken dishes that were outstanding. \n\nGreat job all round, thanks Dhaba."
1,This was my first visit here and I had a great pedicure. They take their time and did an excellent job. They even did a hot wax treatment. \n\nThe salon was clean & very busy even at 12pm on a Sunday when they opened. I would make an appointment or go on a week night.
0,"i hardly write bad reviews.  just not my style i guess... but i just cannot get over our experience at raffles cafe.\n\nfive of us went down to raffles for breakfast friday morning.  the restaurant was not busy, so tell me... why did breakfast take an hour and 45 minutes?\n\ntime it took to get seated (and awkwardly shuffled around to different waiting areas by the hostess): 10 minutes.\n\ntime it took for us to get acknowledged by someone: 15 minutes.\n\ntime it took for that someone to get our waters: 10 minutes.\n\ntime it took for our actual server to come and take our orders after we got our waters: 10 minutes.\n\ntime it took for our food - all breakfast... EGGS, for god's sake - to come after we ordered: 45 minutes.  45 f-ing minutes!\n\ntime it took for us to eat of our mediocre, lukewarm, barely a step above denny's food:  5 minutes.  we were starving.  yet, that didnt make the food taste any better.\n\ntime it took for us to get our bill: 10 minutes.\n\n= 1 hour, 45 minutes.\n\nridiculous."
1,"Awesome etouffee.  It actually isn't as spicy as I thought it'd be.  I got the shrimp, chicken, and crawfish combo.  Actually wish i didn't get the chicken (even though it was super tender), I just didn't get as much rice...which probably would have been really good with the sauces.  Other than that....pretty cool music by local musicians....great ambiance and good times.  =)\n\nIf work sends me back out here again, I wouldn't mind coming back..."
1,"Service:\n   * Fantastic service and upbeat, friendly staff.\n\nAmbience:\n   * I spent a week in Montreal and dined out as much as my schedule permitted.  Of all the fancy French and Italian places that I dined at, I liked the unpretentious and casual environment of this restaurant.  It was warm, open, with display of their seafood, and very energetic.\n\nFood, Portion, and Quality:\n   *  I regret not trying the pork dishes and opted for lobster and seafood.  Not able to provide too much review on food, but I would not order my dishes again.\n\nDrinks:\n   * We had beer and cocktails, made by a super cute and friendly bartender.  The drinks went well with our meal."
1,Came in to eat late at night and they had a variety of Buffalo wings. I can't believe there were so many types. I was looking for Buffalo Wild Wings and the hotel had a list of place to eat and I stumble upon this place. Very good wings.
0,"I actually just left there and couldn't wait to write a review.  I am so pissed off for the underhanded up charges.  Beer and bites my ass!\n\nI have been here a number times, mostly because it is close to home.  It is always dead in here and the few people that frequent here are chain smokers.  On the bright side, I usually get good service here and if your just drinking beer it is good enough.\n\nI stopped by here for lunch and a few things rubbed me the wrong way.  I ordered the chicken club special and a bloody mary.  The bloody mary was $8.25.  Are well drinks in crappy local bars really 8.25?  The chicken club special was barely edible, I had to drink 3 glasses of water just to choke it down.  If you are going to offer a special - make it special or at least better than you average fare.  \n\nNow here is what really pisses me off.  When I order the special, the waitress asked what I wanted for a side.  It was implied that a side order came with a sandwich and a sandwich usually comes with a side at all places like this.  Nobody said anything about a charge for fries or anything!  I get billed for the special and extra for the sides.  It is just a dirty trick.  The special turned out to be anything but special.  \n\nA basic crappy bar lunch with one drink rings in at $37.  Really?  Then a tip and lunch for 2 people was over $40? \n\nNOTE to the owners of PT's:  You would be better off offering a better product at fair prices than trying to profit off every sandwich served.  You have about 25 tables in the restaurant part and I have never seen anyone sitting in there... and I can see why."
1,"i cant wait til i save enough money so i can spend a night in a room at the bellagio! its been too expensive for me.\ni have toured elsewhere around the bellagio, and love everything about it! their ceiling is pretty awesome in the lobby area. theres also a glass horse located in the lobby too, like a disco horse! the bellagio fountains are also a major plus! i will edit my review once i stay a night here in a room and maybe it will be bumped up to five stars."
1,"This place offers so much yet I have experienced so little.  I've lived down the street ever since it was built but have only made the 10 minute (walking) trek twice.  The first time was to see the Chuck Jones exhibit which was very cool and very interesting.  The second time was last night for their open mic night (http://www.tempe.gov/TCA/wiw.htm).\n\nThe inside and outside of the TCA is actually pretty cool.  I've never seen the inside the concert area, but inside the surrounding area is pretty neat.  I can't really explain it but it has a good vibe.\n\nMy wife and I have been wanting to try their lounge/cafe/bar thing ever since it opened.  We heard that it was a nice place to sit and enjoy the TCA and the surrounding sights.  So, when we heard about the live music in the lounge we finally decided to give the place a try.  However, upon arriving, we found that the open mic thing had grown to popular so it was moved into a much larger and less intimate area of the TCA.  The room was nice but reminded me of a room in a conference center, but it did have a very good view of their negative edge pool/fountain thing overlooking the lake.  There was small bar setup where you could purchase wine/beer/cocktails and snacks.  Nothing to elaborate, fancy or expensive.  Anyway, my wife and I sat for about an hour and listened to some up-and-coming musicians.  I really wasn't a fan of them, but I give them mad props for getting up there and doing their thing.  However, it was a relatively good time and I could probably sit there all night and listen to random and diverse music.  You can check it out every Wednesday from 6:30 till 11:30 I think.  The bar shuts down at 9ish though.\n\nAfter we left the the open mic area we visited the main bar/lounge thing.  It had a very nice ambiance and was pretty dead which was nice.  You can sit, watch tv or enjoy the view of the lake.  The beer/wine/cocktail selection is pretty standard for a small bar.\n\nAnyway, it was a neat experience and nice to have a place like TCA less than a mile from my house.  I'm not sure I would rush back to the open mic thing, but if I'm ever board on a Wednesday night, I know where to walk.  However, I can't wait to see a concert/show in the main concert hall to see what that's all about."
1,Food was excellent! We had Crispy Artichoke Hearts and asparagus fries for appetizer. Both were great but especially loved the artichoke hearts. Next we had Caesar salad which needed some more cheese or salt but still tasted pretty good. I had prime rib and my husband had sirloin steak both came with mashed potatoes and green beans. They were both very good. I probably would choose grilled sirloin steak between two. For dessert my husband had warm peach cobbler and I had chocolate lava cake. So good. Hot bread they brought was also very tasty. Our experience were overall great. Our waiter Mark was nice and kept coming back and checking on us. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant.
1,"Best service and menu in Edinburgh. If you're in the city, don't miss this place. Compliments to the chef and staff - regardless of where you stay, if you find yourself on the Royal Mile (and who doesn't?), make your way down to The Canon's Gait for a great lunch or dinner."
0,"Maybe this place has potential?\n\nThe theme of this bar is nice. Very comfortable. \n\nCame here on a Sunday afternoon, not very busy. We received zero service for a cocktail waitress. Not even a \""Hello\"" . Our party of 5 made about 15 trips to the bar, so she missed out on a decent sized  tab! Even ordered food from bartender. \n\nNot sure if I would go out of my way to visit again.. So many other  Oldtown bars with average to great service from waitresses.. Why come back to ZERO ??"
1,"I really really wished they had a place like this in cali.  southern cali specifically since I live in LA, cause we have nothing like this here and I am more the jealous.  This is basically a genghis khan self-service version + you get soup!!!  So the fun and excitement of this place is that you are able to pack your food into your bowl... as much as you want... whatever you want... however you want... including the meat!!  It was soo funn-- I've never gotten to do that and I seriously had the best 5 mins of my life. :)  Sauces are delicious and I got creative with the sauces mixing a couple of flavors and added green onions and peanuts"
0,"This is based solely on the Dobson location as I normally go to the Val Vista location. I went to the Dobson location because my normal location had to reschedule but I'm 40 weeks and have to see a doctor, this location was my option. I waited 20 minutes past my appointment time just to get called back. Then I waited another 40 minutes for the doctor to come in. I heard her talking outside the door for a very long time about tacos, insurance, and other nonsense. I was getting pretty angry because I'm sitting with no pants on waiting to be examined, for 40 minutes, while the doctor (I didn't know it was her at the time) was outside my door shooting the shit. \n\nIt was just a very frustrating experience and I'll never return to this location again."
0,"We have been here twice with a large family and we have had mixed experiences which led me to a lot of trouble with reviewing this restaurant.\n\nFirst of all, lets talk about the ambiance (because that is the reason you show up).  The view is spectacular.  The magician that shows up at the table is amusing and fun - kids love it.  Now the slide.  First time we showed up a year ago, my kids (4, 6 and 8) slid happily for an hour.  The second time there were new rules and a mean woman that yelled at my 30 pound daughter and made her cry (yes, I carried a child out of the rooste crying).  \n\nFood.  Well, its pretty bad - very fried.  The side salad and biscuit were decent.  Everything that followed was overpriced and nasty.  First of all, I had kids that didn't want the normal hot dog and chicken fingers kid's meal so I had to pay $3 for a meal share for each of them (really????).  The steak was not good.  The kid's spaghetti was sent back (and the butter noodles that replaced it were welcomed).\n\nThey couldn't bring us the check quick enough and we are done with our annual trip there."
1,I wasn't familiar with this small chain until I traveled to the Southwest last year.  Elephant Bar was a welcome find when I visited one near Albuquerque last December.  The menu is diverse ranging from salads to sandwiches to stir fry to entrees.  I have tried a selection from each of the menu sections and I have always enjoyed my food at the Elephant Bar.\n\nStaff is trained well and very informed about the menu choices.  I like the casual atmosphere of each Elephant Bar and I find them good for lunch meetings.\n\nManager Leo at this Scottsdale location is welcoming and attentive to details throughout the restaurant.  Elephant Bar is along something of a restaurant row on Mayo.  Parking is plentiful and the restaurant is easy to find off of Scottsdale Road.

1,"5 stars for hole-in-the-wall Thai - great food, bargain prices, basic atmosphere...often that's just what I'm looking for as a foodie.\n\nI've tried a number of Thai places in Vegas and this is the best by far.  Thai Style Noodle House could hold it's own in the Bay area...and that's saying something!\n\nAs any good Thai restaurant should - TSNH brings the heat so aficionados can rest assured they will get the goods.  Thai newbies - I wouldn't order above a 5 (they do 1-10 on the heat scale).\n\nThis will be one of my go-to spots in Vegas from now on!"
1,"OUTSTANDING!\n\nService and food were great. AND, considering location, prices very moderate."
1,"It was 6 of us. We had burgers and fries, onion rings. We thought the food was tasty. The only low we sad, was the onions rings were costly for so few."
0,"I have been going to Medhi Ansarinia for about 10 years. I had not been to him for a couple of years, just had stuff going on in my life. I always thought very highly of him and his office, he is the only doctor who ever gave me relief from my daily headaches and migraines. He moved to a new office and so I went to see him after my interval. I am so disappointed. I still think Dr. Ansarinia is great, but his staff and his interns are AWFUL. I have spent two whole days in that office answering questions and being poked with needles, went to have the blood work which was another whole day out of my weekend. They gave me drugs which I told them don't work, trust me I have tried them all. They ask questions and then argue with you when you try to answer them. They are rude and condescending. One of the staff members, a younger hispanic man, after giving me shots in my neck to relieve the migraines, took my blood pressure and then told me to go home, even though I was so dizzy I couldn't walk, then the nurse sees me and yells at me...doesn't help me mind you, but yells at me to go back and lay down and asks me if I am crazy.\nThe final straw is that the Doctor said he would call in a script for a medication I know works for me, and when I went to pick it up at the pharmacy....they didn't have it. I called the Doctor office three times before finally reaching someone..the guy who answers the phone is very sweet and efficient, btw....and so I leave a message about the script.\nThey call me back and then the girl who calls me back, yells at me, calls me rude when I try to explain why I need that script, tells me that's not the medication I need, and then when I tell her that the doctor has already prescribed this medicine to me, she tells me \""Oh no you din't!!!\"" I was so surprised by her attitude and her unprofessional manner...I was shocked frankly.\nI hung up from the conversation after telling her to nevermind, I would find another doctor, to which she was happy to reply \""good\"". Wow\nI am still wondering if they are talking to everyone this way and if this is their common demeanor towards the patients. IT does seem as if the office is always busy. \nAnyways, what a waste of time for me. \nI would stay away from this doctor and his staff. They are in need of an attitude adjustment."
1,"Oh Le Petit Hotel. How I wanted to give you 5 stars. But to earn 5 stars in my book, you have to be perfect. And you were so close to perfect, but just not quite there.\n\nThe. best. shower. ever. Seriously, ever. So crucial to warm up after a day of walking around in the ridiculous cold. Props for the side jets and ample shower head settings.\n\nLarge, comfy beds. Modern decor. Delicious complimentary breakfast. If you want a latt\u00e9 or capp, just ask the barista and she'll make one for you at the counter.\n\nBuuuuuuut...they didn't replace the toiletries. BOTH nights I stayed there. And the Aveda products are so amazing, this was really a bummer.\n\nI'll still be back in a heartbeat next time I'm in Montr\u00e9al. I'll just come armed with my own shampoo and conditioner."
1,People from Chicago truly appreciate the pleasure of seeing  Garretts  now in other places. We love them and just wish we could get them to Dallas!  Its pricey for ordinary popcorn but this isnt ordinary so it's woth the couple extra bucks.  Tip...if you put in the  freezer what you want to save for later. It definitely works. We stock up and have later!
1,"Great place for any Las Vegas virgins like my girlfriend and I. Stayed there this past weekend and LOVED IT!!  We did the check in at the airport and  avoided the long lines at the mgm  lobby. I read as many reviews as I could in the 70 days  before our trip so I knew exactly what to expect. Some of the idiots on here shouldve done the same thing and maybe they wouldn't be bitching about stupid little things like \""omg  the TV in our room wasn't a flat screen!!, OMG we did not have  a coffee maker in our room!!! OMG the water pressure in the bathroom  was weak(turn the knob idiot)!! OMG  we were at the very edge of the strip.\""  Hey MORONS, that's what websites like this one and trip advisor are for.  Quit complaining because you were too stupid to research your trip...\n The rooms were perfectly acceptable. Average size, comfy bed, great view of strip if you ask nicely. We  were lucky enough to  get a room on the 21st floor, next to our friends so no complaints about that.  Reception  on TV was sub par but who's watching TV in Vegas? Casino is really nice and you can hardly smell the smoke. AS previous reviews have stated, casino has a nice perfume to cover smell up. Dining options are a plenty, from $$$$-$. So if you lose tons of money like I did, there is always McDonald's :) \nPool area is overrated.  A bunch of douche bag drunks when I was there and the pool had a disgusting layer of suntan lotion floating above it at all times(In directors pool at least).  Weather was nice but pool needed to be 100 times colder  then the nasty luke warm  temp it was on my one and only trip down there(nice little walk btw)...\n You should def try to catch Ka if you are there(awesome awesome show) you will be amazed!! The theater itself is really cool and not a bad seat in the house.  Oh and here is a tip, If you are on a high floor and the elevator lobby is full, go through the double doors towards the back and get on the elevator that goes to the penthouse because its usually empty.  When you're checking out, get on  an elevator going up instead of down as those will probably be jammed with idiots by the time they get to you. \nWe did have an issue with cleaning staff as I overflowed the john, they took a while to get there and then never cleaned up the mess from the water. No biggy though as we had friends across the way :)  Walls are paper thin though so be aware because you could here your neighbors and vice versa pretty damn good if you are trying to sleep. If you  pass out then I guess it doesn't matter :).... Overall  GREAT HOTEL AND CASINO!!! I did not try the buffet but will try it on my next trip. Fat Tuesday was awesome and you should def visit it 5 or 6 times while you are there!"
0,"I took my cat in for a second opinion not realizing she would leave in a box ! I went in on an emergency basis so when hydration was offered I put her in the hospital, I should have and would have taken her home If I had been told she was terminal. I NEVER received that second opinion I went in there for, my error was trusting the Vet ! My cat was having trouble eating and drinking and had gone from 13 pounds to 51/2 pounds. \n\nThe Doc. said she was dehydrated and that \"" we'll get her to eat\"" there is no way they ever got this cat to eat anything ! She wouldn't eat the treats that previously she would \"" kill for \"" !! She was starving to death in that hospital,nothing but a skeleton and couldn't stand up for long and you could have knocked her over with a feather when she was standing ,she was so weak, too weak to meow,she tried, you could see her tummy move, what was left of it! all I could do was cry, and I'm still crying ! \n\nThey put her on IV fluids to hydrate her and implied she was on the IV constantly so I couldn't take her home. I was never told that this cat was dying and we should put her down to end her suffering. I said from the beginning that I didn't want to run up a bill large enough to send the doc. on a world tour. I was told not to worry about the bill and late into this the Doc told me it would be $200.00 .\n\nI left the cat and was strung along for ten days as the cat continued to deteriorate. The Doc. would not return my calls, would tell me she would call me the next day and failed to do so . I would get encouraging statements from the Doc. I would be told, \"" call tomorrow to see if she can go home \"" While the cat continued to lose weight. This was outright inhumane , it also deprived me of having my beloved cat at home for a few more days before her passing. \n\nI took her body home in a Reused box they apparently had laying around somewhere, after I finally insisted that she was not getting better and that she was dying and that we need to put her down, I told them, \"" this borders on inhumane \"" !!! On one visit i said. \"" she's gotten much worse \"" the Doc said to me \"" you think so ? \"". Dear God it was so obvious !!\n\nI am so devastated over thinking about my beloved cat spending her dying days in a cage with strangers and all kinds of noise etc.around her . I'm still in tears thinking how my beloved cat spent the last 10 days of her life , in that cage dying of starvation.\n\nBy the way, the bill turned out to be over $600.00 . triple what I was told it would be !!!\n\nThe worst part is that I was deprived of being with my beloved cat for the last 10 days of her life.If these people put money over the welfare of our animals and the owners feelings ( and they do ), GOD HELP US ALL !!!\n\nDo some people need money that bad or are some people just Evil ?\n\nIf you love your pet , as we all do, please do not take your pet to this animal hospital , treat them better than that, they deserve better.I'm still devastated thinking of how my beloved cat spent her last days. I doubt I'll ever get over it .\n\nMy Vet was Susie Costa-Fakler, DVM"
1,"Excellent ramen & takoyaki. At decent prices as well. Would come back everyday if I can, especially for the takoyaki. I mean it's $4.80! It's a steal! \nCustomer service is also a thumbs up. Very well appreciated by the waitresses. They also do bill separation with your pals when you request for it. \nAtmosphere is a plus. Might be a bit small but it's still good."
0,"I'm not sure how this restaurant has an average rating of 4 stars. It is definitely not a 4-star type of restaurant. The restaurant is cheaply decorated with blankets hanging over the doorways to the toilets. To get to the toilets, you have to use your hand to wave the blanket out of the way and then venture down the hall which is filled with junk.\n\nFirst, the menu is much too large for them to make any single dish really well. Second, the quality of the food is severely lacking. Third, they handed us a cheesy calendar on our way out the door, for marketing purposes I suppose. It was tossed in the rubbish bin as soon as we returned to the hotel.\n\nI ordered a glass of the house red wine and got a glass of white wine. I presume it was the house white wine as they only serve their house wines in glasses - everything else much be purchased by the bottle. Having once been a white wine drinker but not having had a glass of white wine in about 4 years, I decided to just deal with it and to my surprise, the wine was quite tasty. In fact, it was the best part of the meal. Ironic, since I didn't actually order the white wine!\n\nFor the starter we ordered the Japenese Dumplings (#5 on the menu) and the Grilled Chicken Skewer (#12). I thought the dumplings were ok, my husband said that they tasted like tasteless mush. He like the chicken skewers and I thought they tasted like nothing.\n\nI ordered the spicy tuna maki sushi (#53) and the tuna was chewy. It has a very strong smell of fish and the rolls came apart as I attempted to eat them. This should never happen. My husband ordered the spicy salmon maki sushi (#54) and he said that it wasn't spicy at all and in fact, was rather tasteless.\n\nWe cut our losses and did not order dessert and made our way out of the restaurant as quickly as possible.\n\nDress code on a Saturday night for dinner service is very casual. I think that you would easily be able to get away with gym attire and trainers.\n\nWould not recommend."
1,"Just awesome, i guarantee it"
0,"The BEST part about this place was this BEAUTIFUL male go-go dancer. He was probably the best looking, best dancing, dancer, I have EVER seen in my life. Too bad he was gay. Too bad for me, that is. The music sucked, until about 3 AM.. It got better after that. Damn, by then, I'm too fucking tired though! \nThey did have some cool acrobatics up above.. kinda Cirque Du Soleil-esque.. kinda cool.. WHY CAN'T ANY OF THESE GOD FORSAKEN CLUBS PLAY DECENT MUSIC?? Even consistent Top 40 would have been ok, but NOOOOOOOO... what is UP WITH THIS Rock N' Roll/Trance mixing shit?? Jebus.. It's unbearable..\nOh, they had lockers. That was cool, cuz we had like 5 jackets.. haha..\nThe dudes were pretty much all barf too. Except one, but he liked my girl.. too bad for him, cuz she had a man.. HAHA..\nOh well... I still managed to get my dance on and ROCKED it to Holla Back Girl.. HAHAHA.."
1,"We stopped by here for lunch this afternoon. The place was packed.\n\nI thought we'd have a long wait, but we were shown to a booth in just a few minutes.\n\nThe hostess and our waitress were both very friendly. I appreciated them taking the extra effort to stay friendly when it was crazy busy like that. I deal with the public on a daily basis and know when it's super busy like that it can sometimes be a challenge to keep a smile on your face and a kind word on your lips.\n\nAll of our meals were excellent. If I'm ever in the neighborhood I'd definitely eat here again."
0,"Worst hotel in Vegas. Not because this property is older or not as nice as other Vegas hotels, but because management does not value the customers or it's hotel. Here's why it's terrible: \n\n1) Customer service. We booked the FabDeluxe room on hotels.com mainly because the Flamingo is known for its wonderful pools. My sister is under 21 and the website did not clarify that there is only one small wading pool for people under 21. When we went to talk to management about this misleading information, the manager Ryan Ramsey was rude and stared blankly at me the whole time. He said that he would get us a pass to swim at Caesar's Palace but never did and wouldn't return our phone calls. We ended up checking out of the hotel the next day because it was 108 degrees and we just wanted to swim in a nice pool. It's just so disappointing that the Flamingo doesn't care about satisfying their customers. \n\n2) Dirty. It's one thing if the hotel is old, it's another thing if it is dirty. There was tape on the ceiling of our hotel room. The shower had hair in it. The pillows smelled terrible. The carpet was disgusting. The elevators didn't work and had graffiti in them. Terrible. I've stayed in 1 and 2 star hotels in Vegas that were cleaner. \n\n3) Check-in. Took forever and we ended up having to wheel our luggage through the hotel to get to the lobby then back through another part of the hotel to get to the elevators. Terrible design. Why would you have guests wheeling luggage over multiple flights of stairs?\n\n4) Food. We had tickets for the buffet which was pretty good, except one of the chairs at our table had vomit-looking stains on it. Everything was broken and needed updating. Which is fine, but they clearly have no pride in their hotel. \n\n5) Noise. I heard the person above me sneeze all night long and the shower dripped water. \n\nUltimately, this hotel is going down hill. There is no pride in ownership of this place. Everyone that works there looks unhappy and are not very pleasant to talk to. The exception to this was Fran at the front desk. She was pleasant. It's apparent the Flamingo doesn't care about its guests. The hotel has made no effort to maintain itself or keep up with a changing Las Vegas. My thought is that they are going to close within the the next few years and the owners are trying to get a couple more bucks out of it in the meantime. I would recommend any other hotel in Vegas. I even stayed in the Palace Station once and it was 50x better than this place. Avoid the Flamingo! They treat you like scum!"
0,This was the slowest place I've ever seen! 25 minutes and 2 people in line. I finally gave up and asked for my money back. The staff has no motivation. Never again! I hope a general manager does something about this slow ass place!
0,"If you like going to clubs, you will love this place. If you value good service, a friendly attitude, really good food, and a good value, go somewhere else.\n\nThis is a classic case of poor management. Both times I went there, we found tables available, but were told to wait 15-20 minutes.\n\nThe first time, I had a plane to catch. By the time I was seated, and they finally came over to take our order, I had to leave.\n\nThe second time, I gave them a chance. Long wait, and by the time one of the \""hip\"" waitresses came over, the ice in my soft drink had melted. \n\nThe burgers were decent, but honestly, there is a Japanese Burger truck that goes to various locations. It's a lot better, a lot more fun, and better priced. \n\nAs I said before, the crowd that goes here seems really \""in\"" and \""trendy\"", and act like they are sitting at VIP Tables in a Club.  The waitresses act like they are cocktail waitresses at a club. The management thinks they are really cool.\n\nIf they had a product that justified this arrogant attitude, fine. My wife thought they had great Sweet Potato Fries. That's about it."
1,"Bad Daddy's is one of our favorite locations for lunch or dinner.  We've been several times since they opened in Ballantyne and we've never been disappointed.  The service is always great, attentive and very informative.  They have awesome daily special burgers and drinks.\n\nOn a Friday or Saturday the place is usually pretty packed, and tonight was no different, but our server, Ashley, was FANTASTIC!  She was so attentive and helpful and made suggestions that were genuine and didn't feel \""sales-y\"".  \n\nI usually do the build your own salad, but tonight I went with the Cantina burger (veggie) and it was awesome.  Hubs always gets the Western burger (buffalo) and he swears buy it.  Juicy, meaty and totally delicious.   My favorite appetizer is the fried pickles, but tonight we tried the homemade chips and pimento cheese and it was also awesome.  \n\nAs we were paying the bill our server (Ashley) asked if we'd ever been in for breakfast and we said we hadn't.  She offered us a to-go menu and told us we should certainly check it out.  (And I'm sure we will)!\n\nI highly recommend Bad Daddy's for a work lunch, a lunch w/friends or a night out with the family.  Great atmosphere, excellent food and fantastic service.  Proud to call this franchise local and excited to see where it goes!"
0,"Service was decent, even though it was busy for lunch both times.  Food came out quickly, once ordered.\n\nFor the quality level of the food the cost was a bit high.  I believe the lunch specials were around $10.  The Salsa was decent, but the cooked food was greasy.   They do offer the option of black beans instead of refried, which is nice.  There are large portions, but quality of ingredients isn't there, and food is somewhat bland, requiring that you season with the salsa to get some flavor."
0,"Decent food for the price. Not the best atmosphere. But overall, not a bad choice for a casual meal."
1,My 16 year old nephew & I went on one of the steamboat tours and really enjoyed ourselves. I would recommend this to everyone at least once. I was surprised at how big Canyon Lake really was.
0,"High school girls seating patrons badly, waiters bringing plates and bowls long after the food was served (?). Mundo survives for one reason...only restaurant near Smith's theater. If Smith's would so much as start serving hotdogs and nachos, Mundo would close down. Until then Las Vegas will not have a Broadway class theater. Patrons of the Arts demand culinary choices equivalent to the Playbill."
1,"Big box supply stores have there pros and cons. What sets them apart, in my opinion,  is the people that work at them. The folks at this HD are friendly and knowledgeable on where products are located.   \n\nI'm in and out of this store allot and for being a very busy HD they normally have what I need and plenty of checkout lines open."
1,This place may be out of the way for many Las Vegans but it's right in my neighborhood so it's a convenient 5min drive for me to get tapas as good as Firefly at a more reasonable price. \n\nI wish they didn't remove the pineapple and salmon skewers but the bacon wrapped dates are to die for. The paella is tasty and not too sauteed. Mojitos and sangria are pretty good as well.
1,My family and I were craving sushi for Fourth of July and we decided to give Inaka a try. I was hesitant because of mixed reviews but it was so convenient to our home in Mountains Edge we decided to give it a chance.  The sushi rolls were delicious especially the Inaka roll. We will definitely be coming back.
0,"I guess I shouldn't have high expectations for a chain, but I was quite disappointed in this place. Went for happy hour with some friends who apparently like coming here (not sure why though). \n\nAlthough I will say that the service was awesome, the \""good\"" ends there. \n\nThe food, meh. We had some apps including calamari (kinda tough), spinach dip (I've had better), and the avocado rolls (the best out of the 3). Not super impressed with any of it. \n\nThe drinks, they were made well, but at $4.75 for WELL on HAPPY HOUR - it really didn't make me very happy at all. \n\nNext time I will go somewhere else for happy hour where the food and drink prices really do make me happy."
1,"Great sushi and service coming in for dinner.  And fast!  We ordered four rolls and expected a little bit of a wait, but we weren't even done with our edamame before these tasty rolls showed up.\n\nOne of the better sushi places I've found in the Valley."
1,"Came here President's day weekend and it was packed. \n\nThanks to Kenny L. we were able to get in pretty quickly (20 minutes) and without cover charges ! Yay! (why is this amazing you ask? because we had 5 guys in our group of 9) Yes. It's practically a miracle in Vegas on a Saturday night of a 3 day weekend.\n\nThe inside of the club was pretty nice, lots of lights (surprise surprise!) and acrobats in the sky. Music was dance-able to and the drinks were not too watered down. Girls get 2 free drinks before midnight. Kinda small compared to places like XS though because they don't have an outdoor area. BUT they don't have too many stairs (just 2 flights at the most I think) and that is the BEST part in my opinion lol. \n\nThe worst part is the wait for the bathroom, which pretty much goes true for every single busy club everywhere. \n\nOther than that, would I be choose Light again next time? Sure, why not!"
1,"I wish there were more stars to give! \n\nDr Steve is by far the best chiropractor I've been to. I'm a travel nurse on an assignment in Chandler and I hadn't been to a chiropractor in years but decided it was time to get my body back into shape. I found Dr Steve on yelp and I am so happy I did. To start, Carmen and Anasia are super helpful. Anasia knows what she is doing and both of them greet you with a smile always. Dr Steve is great as well, he is very intelligent but warm and friendly, he also remembered my name everytime I came in. Just like some of the other Yelp poster's said, he spends quite a bit of time with you and is very invested in your care; he certainly is very busy but I never felt rushed by any of the staff. He has young and old coming to him and I think that's a compliment to his treatment style. I appreciated his passion for results and working as a \""team\"" with me; He even offered to do some research on kinesio tape that I asked him about so we might be able to incorporate it into my treatment.\n\n I felt like he appreciated my input as to how I was feeling and he always answered any questions I had. He's very much into a holistic type of care. He has the up to date technology but also has the natural/holistic too. He put me on a program of several times a week and within the first few visits I was already in a better mood and sleeping soundly. He also has insight into diet and making your whole body better not just doing the physical manipulation.  Everybody that I met there was happy and felt great, so that obviously shows something about Dr Steve's skills as a chiropractor.\n\nI recently went on vacation then found out I was moving. I was so busy I didn't have time to call and let them know; but then they called me concerned about how I was doing because I hadn't been in lately. Now how often do you get that from a healthcare professional?? :)\n\nIf it wasn't for my job moving me around I would continue to come here. It was worth every penny and more!! I cannot say enough about Dr Steve and his clinic!"
0,"Nice facility. None of the rental agencies had much of a line except Dollar, which was HUGE and SLOW.  Would give more stars to the Center if they would shut down the scandalous raquet conducted by Dollar's lackeys both at the counter and in the parking lot. (See terrible reviews for Dollar.)"
1,Staff and Doctors were very nice and helpful.  I enjoyed the experience with choosing my frames.  I also enjoyed the frames they carried.  I am a guy that likes more of a sporty look and I loved that fact that they carried some nice Oakley frames.  I will definitely continue to be a patient of their's.
1,"Burgers, Tacos, Wings, & Beer.. everything you'd expect from a diners, drive-ins, & dives professional!\n\nThe Quad is really starting to shape into an attractive Vegas casino.. as long as you don't see their hotel rooms. haha\nThe addition of Guy Fieri's restaurant, along with Hash House, really steps up the food game in this area of the strip..\n\nFood: Going through the menu, there weren't a lot of fancy-shmancy ingredients or toppings.. just your classic all-American foods assembled into fantastic combinations.\nI decided to go with the Mac+Cheese Bacon Burger.. the ultimate burger throw-up! The patty: very thin but wide, coming out of the burger covering the entire bottom bun.. while the bacon and mac&cheese slightly oozed out on top of the patty. This is the true definition of a \""beautiful mess\"". Very tasty burger, loved the 5-cheese mac&cheese and the simple \""backyard BBQ\"" grilled type of burger. \nThe fries that came with the burger came in 3 types: ridged, curly, and wedges.. awesome!\nWe also ordered the Triple-T fries which was like truffle overload with gouda. We didn't get to try any of the specialty cocktails.. there were many interesting concoctions that we'll definitely try next time.\n\nAmbiance: I'd describe it as an Ed Hardy-themed restaurant.. even the napkins had skulls. haha. A lively restaurant with high, exciting energy. If you're there for lunch, definitely sit outside.. you get the view of the walkway between Harrah's and The Quad, and the front of Caesars. I'm not sure how it is at night but probably crazy loud with Harrahs' Carnival court right next door.\n\nService: Staff was great.. there were two consistent servers continually checking on us. It was a bit of a wait for our food to come out but I give them a little leeway since the restaurant's still brand new.\n\nTips: Don't pass up this place if you're torn on what to eat on the strip. Grab a burger, a few drinks, and enjoy!"
1,"this place is so wonderful! warm bread always, good food, service is amazing. I always have to come here first when I get to Vegas. Wish they had one in the Bay Area. I se people compare it to Cheescake Factory but this is way better but yet somewhat similar. Located in The Venetian Hotel."
0,"I went there for the breakfast buffet... it was alright.  I was able to get a comp pass for playing at the poker tables for a couple hours - so I you really can't go wrong if its free.  The only tasteful things that I remember eating were the prime rib, scrambled eggs, sausage, and fruit - only because everything else I thought was just okay."
0,"I feel it is my civic duty to warn you away from Diablo's barbecue house on St Denis. I've eaten there twice now, and both experiences can be described with the exact same phrase: a clusterfuck of sheer ineptitude.\n\nI really wanted to like this no-frills smokehouse, but it would seem that the majority of the aforementioned smoke is, unfortunately, coming out of the kitchen staff's ineptitude.\n\nThe first time I went was at lunch on a Friday. The place was empty, but it still took us over an hour to get our food, which was mediocre at best.\n\nThe second time was this evening... Diablo's is currently winning Montreal Burger week, so we thought we'd check it out. I have to say that, after tonight, I have no idea how this victory came about, because they managed to totally mess up our order... twice.\n\nHaving queued for half an hour to get a table, we then waited for half an hour for a waitress to take our order, followed by another half hour wait for our drinks to arrive. Half an hour after that, we actually got our food. We had ordered their Burger Week special, The Cheesus, which was described to us as a deliciously seasoned beef burger, cooked, then battered and flash fried, served with smoked ketchup, chicken fried steak sauce, three slices of bacon and, instead of a bun, fried Haloumi cheese. Wow! That sounds pretty good, non? Except when our burgers arrived (after two hours of waiting) there was only one piece of Haloumi \""bun\"" so we couldn't pick them up. We sent the order back, and we got brand new Cheesuses, quick smart. We started to tuck in and realized that there was neither any batter, nor bacon, and the burgers were dry and relied on an ocean of sauce to deliver any flavour. Seriously? This was supposed to be a prize-winning burger experience, not two hours of waiting followed by a double cock-up and bitter disappointment.\nNot to mention the fries were cold with order 1, and overcooked on order 2.\n\nThe manager did comp our drinks,and did his best to apologize but the damage was done - after two and a half hours of waiting for what can only be described as a flavourless gimmick, and having to send it back, it was the least he can do. \n\nAvoid. And make the trek to Blackstrap BBQ, whose food and ambience are miles better than this."
0,I don't think it was worth the money. I left still hungry and ate my poor tasting BBQ chicken sandwich in about 60 sec. before leaving. 50 cent draft comes in a tiny cup (prob about 1/3 of a can of beer).
1,"I absolutely love this place. The service is professional, attentive, and friendly. The food is always prepared exceptionally. The drinks are strong but not overpowering the taste of the flavors. If you go, PLEASE GET THE MUSSELS-- I'm from Seattle and these are some of the best I have had (as well as the oysters). Can be a little spendy-- but hey you have to pay some money sometimes for good food. \n\nSimply I do not know why this place is getting some bad reviews. You HAVE to go ."
1,"Most of the reviews on Yelp didn't rave too much about their Chinese food. However, I was dying to eat some good sushi and decided to try this place out.  Plus it was just downstairs from my room. \n\nI walked in by myself (I was traveling alone) and asked to sit in front of the sushi chefs.  Sitting at the sushi bar made my experience here an awesome one!  Jason the sushi chef convinced me to try Uni (sea urchin) for the first time!  I'm from Hawaii, and have never tried it before. I was always skeptic by the way it looked.  I ordered Unagi, Toro and Uni. I've had awesome sushi before and let's just say that this place was real close to it.  If you want sushi in the Pyramid... this is the place to go.\n\nThe servers were really catering too. Decor was beautiful. Sushi was fresh. Somewhat on the pricey side.....but everything is pricey in Vegas right? :)  It was well worth every penny."
1,"Been going here for a few years.  Always great service and delicious, fresh food.  Like another reviewer said, you know it's a good sushi place when it's Japanese-owned.\nThe negative reviewers probably went on a (rare) bad day or are just big complainers in general."
0,"I was torn about leaving a negative review, as in the past I've had incredibly positive experiences with six different piercings at Sadu.  However, after thinking back on today's events I feel compelled to issue a stern warning.  Since Autumn left last fall, it seems as though the staff has been different each time I went in for work.  This in itself is not an issue, why I write is to offer you warning that your experience will likely be ruined by the inhospitable staff who excel in condescension while offering a ham-handed piercing technique.  After having both nipples pierced, a labret, an industrial, nose-ring, tongue, and ears spaced, and a multitude of other piercings, I am aware of what to expect when I decide to do further body modification.  \n\nThe staff that was working was, simply put, rude.  They were discussing disdainfully the questions that earlier clients had tendered and when they did take a break from verbally assailing these customers to help me they were short and discourteous.  Since I was there for a tragus and not to make friends I tried to dismiss this effrontery.  While the mood temporarily lightened once I went back for the piercing, the young lady with dreadlocks couldn't help but talk about herself for the entire time coming off as narcissistic and  somewhat arrogant.  Again, I soldiered on as I was terribly excited about the piercing despite the staff.  If the verbal treatment of the staff wasn't sufficient to turn me off to Sadu permanently the piercer's brutish handling lacked any semblance of finesse.   So I  would give her skills  five stars -- five stars that had each collapsed into a black hole and merged to form the largest black hole in the universe.  \n\nIf you cannot afford a professional dominatrix to mistreat you I would thoroughly recommend Sadu, if on the other hand you are looking for a positive lasting experience I would go elsewhere.\n\np.s.   to be completely fair they have great jewelry, but nothing you can't find online for the same price.  Good luck."
1,"Gorgeous facilities.  I have started getting my pedicures here a few months ago.  With the 30% locals discount it is not much more than the cheap-o places and is an all-over better experience.  The last time I went I got an 80 minute massage also.  The massage was excellent and the therapist really focused on my shoulders like I asked her to.  The only downside is that they booked my pedicure right after the massage so I did not really get to use the hot tub, sauna, etc. because I didn't want to ruin my pedicure.  I will ask for my appointments to be spread out next time.  TIP:  bring flask of vodka to spike cranberry juice with."
1,"Dr. Kim is a kind and talented healer.  He has helped me with chronic lower back pain in the past and most recently he helped me get relief for blocked inner tubes which resulted from a sinus infection.  I had been seeking help from my family physician for several weeks with no results, but Dr. Kim helped me find relief after only two sessions.  I leave his office feeling calm, energized and with a sense of well-being.  I have recommended him to all my friends and family.\nThank you, Dr. Kim!"
1,"I have a new found love for Indian food and when I found myself in Madison I had to check this place out. It was most excellently delicious! The staff was very nice and the price for 3 people including 4 drinks and an appetizer was about $75. If you ever find yourself on the East side of Madison, you should really check this place out."
0,"On my way home from work, I always walk by this place and I always see people walking into here.  So I decided to give it a shot and see what's up.  I'm not a health freak or a food guru nor am I picky about food but this place is just plain bad.  The $5/meal is pretty decent until they charge you an extra $2 for lo mein instead of rice.  But the biggest thing that bothers me is the huge puddle of oil that the food sits in.  Again, I'm not a health freak but eatting this food just made me feel guilty.  With every bite, I think about getting a heart attack at 27.  There's as much oil as there sauce and you see the thick oil floating above. don't expect a fantastic dining area either.  it's dark and feels icky.  \n\nI've had my fair share of cheap chinese food, and this is probably the worst I've tried."
0,"Thank goodness this lunch buffett was free for me, because the service and food was terrible. Small glass of soda and I only got 1 refill when my glass set empty for quite some time. It was not busy in my servers area, so no excuses.\nFood was not very good and was surprised that they had peel and eat shrimp for the prices they charged, and not shrimp already peeled. Crab legs for lunch but no tools to crack them. Not very many stations with different food being offered as other buffets. Asian gentleman at the dessert station was not friendly and does not need to be in a customer service role"
0,"Meh. Drinks took awhile, food was pretty spare. Spinach artichoke dip was lacking any flavor. Move onto something better."
0,"Below average, overpriced, unwelcoming.\n\nI have been meaning to try this place since it opened. My boyfriend is from North Carolina and loves BBQ so I've been trying to find him a place in Pittsburgh he might enjoy. We got takeout - brisket sandwich, 1/4 fried chicken, meaty Mac, and coleslaw. We found everything to be underwhelming. The brisket was average- it was tender but I've had better.  The fried chicken was salty.  The meaty Mac would have been better without the blue cheese.  I ate it by picking out meat chunks and the crispy cheese on top. The coleslaw was good, and by far our favorite part of the meal. That should say enough. \n\nPrice was $35 for all of the above. \n\nAs far as service, the waitress seemed uninterested in us. There were only three other guests in the downstairs of the restaurant."
1,"This office is the best in Vegas. It has the most knowledgeable Dr's I have found in the valley. They are always cheerful and upbeat. They really care and want you to achieve your goal and be as healthy as you can be. The office staff are great! They are always friendly and ready to help. I have never had to wait, ever. They never up-sell anything. I have no clue what that negative Nancy is talking about that gave a bad review about this office and Dr. I recommend you read all the reviews and give this office a try and leave your honest review afterwards. \nThank you Creative Health Solutions!"
0,"Get to the Chase:\n\nPros:\n1) HUGE\n2) Decent decor and luxurious ambience (fountains, gold, chandeliers, big arse mirrors, masquerades)\n3) LOTS of food choices\n4) Casino is downstairs\n5) VERY courteous staff (you can call the concierge to call you pick up and drop off cab service, which was a nightmare had I done it by myself during EDC 2012) They also get you great rates\n\nCons:\n1) IMPOSSIBLE to navigate...it's so large you can't find anything until you spend at least 2 days wandering around inside. Neither is the layout of the place intuitive\n2) I expected more...most of the decorations, accommodations and service could be found at any other hotel \n3) Rooms aren't as grand as I had hoped...Seemed like a Hilton\n4) Seemed TACKY overall (Everything bigger, mall-feel, and tons of subpar restaurants)"
1,The place has changed since I last went here. Great improvement.Awesome staff!! The beef teriyaki was great and their orange chicken was heavenly.
1,"I went here for dinner with my boyfriend and two friends. We all really enjoyed it a lot. My friend ate his Mac and cheese burger so quickly that I almost forgot they even brought it out. I had a burger and it was seriously awesome. The donkey sauce is delicious and I only wish I could have finished that burger because it was so damn good. \n\nThe drinks were good but a little weak for my liking. The flavors in them are great and very pronounced but it was hard to tell if they were weak or just that the flavors overpowered the alcohol. \n\nI really like the decor as well as the sugar skull napkins and nice cutlery. I would definitely hit this spot again on my next Vegas trip and will look into trying one of Guy Fieri's other spots, too."
1,"Probably 4.5 stars, not the best breakfast spot I have ever had In this world but but hands down the best spot in vegas so it gets 5.  This place is also the same as Egg Works and I have eaten at both spots and they are both excelent. \n\nThere menu is awesome with all the regular stuff plus with crepes, omelets, scrabbles, skillets, bennys, and hawaiian breakfasts.  They also have a cincy chili section that I like, I have never had cincy chili for real but I know what it's all about (over spaghetti) and this chili is real good.  You can also get toast or a banana nut muffin with your meal.   \n\nThey do everything well and I have never been disappointed with anything but my favorites are the cincy chili omelet, enchilada omelet, and anything with their excellent country gravy all over it.  They have a chicken fries steak skillet that is potatoes topped with chopped up fried steak, topped with gravy, topped with eggs however u want, it is AWESOME.  They also won some awards for their cincy chili burger but I have never had it.   \n\nMy good friend and fellow yelper used to think cracked egg was the best place in town and refused to eat here for some stupid reason.  Well we ate here and he was mad at himself for missing out on this place for all these years, don't make the same mistake."
1,"I went to Caffe Davio for brunch and loved it. The place as a nice, small atmosphere. Classic diner feel with hip menu, staff. Seemed like the Fritata was the go to and we all loved it. Good mix of veggie and meaty plates. Would definitely come again."
1,"Being of Irish decent I really was excited to go here. We were in Madison for work and decided to stop in and try it out. We ended up eating there two times out of the four nights we were there. It's very nice inside and out, very relaxed too."
0,"***Fake reviewers/employees have left 3 5-Star Reviews (Mike, Robin, and Marjon), they left similar comments for LIV Avenida, LIV North Scottsdale and LIV Northgate, notice that the comments are from 8 months ago before the property was opened... Nice try! Be aware of this and the deception!!!***"
0,Food is ok. Not bad not great. I had the vegetable fajitas. Beans were soupy. Veggies were drowning in oil. Service was terrible. Slow and  inattentive. Waitress brougt out the wrong meal for my partner. Before we could get a word out she was gone. We didn't see the server again until we were done with our meal. She agreed it was her mistake and took 10% of our bill. The dish served was $13. The dish ordered was $10. She took off $2.33. So in the end we paid more to have a dish we didn't want. I noticed a problem with the table next to us with the bill. Seems to be a real problem with this server.
1,"Had lunch here today, taco and salad combo.   Fresh and full of flavor.  ordered special tuna taco, which was overdone, but management was responsive and courteous.  Excellent wait staff.  Table side Guacamole was ample serving, especially compared to Cantina 1511.   Don Pedro's still does it better, adding radish or jicama for crunch, cilantro, and lemon juice. Margarita was well blended and tequila options were impressive.   Wait staff was impressive!   How Chuys stays in business so close to this place is impossible to understand,"
1,"This location just opened in the past year.  I've had Smashburger before, when I lived in Vegas.  I finally got around to eating at this location.  I decided to order the Arizona Big Smashburger, $6.99 and Fries, $1.99.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smashburger-scottsdale?select=5lRFB7Gm-1U8tkOVjwU25A#5lRFB7Gm-1U8tkOVjwU25A\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smashburger-scottsdale?select=IRp7RymmFmSQng5DDymnGQ#IRp7RymmFmSQng5DDymnGQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smashburger-scottsdale?select=0uFd1V0_r9BfvSJXA96fkA#0uFd1V0_r9BfvSJXA96fkA\n\nThe Arizona Big Smashburger is pretty good...comes with Guacamole and fresh cut Jalapenos.  It has a nice kick to it....and tastes different than most Burgers you find out there.  The Guacamole is fresh and rich....adds a creamy smooth texture and compliments the sharpness of the Jalapeno.\n\nThe Fries are average at best.\n\nThis place gets very busy.  To avoid the crowds, try coming between meal periods.  Also, the parking lot can get nuts here because it's way too small for this shopping center.....I avoid it on the weekends.\n\nReturn Factor - 88%"
1,"Yum. Quiche. Yum.\n\nThat was pretty much my conversation with myself the other day during my lunch at Terrace Cafe. And if you're wondering, yes, it was a one-way conversation. I know you're jealous of my communication skillz.\n\nAnywho, Terrace Cafe, a cute little cafe burrowed in the Piedmont Town Center. Truthfully, when I was seated upstairs and took in their menu for a few minutes, I wasn't wowed by their lunch selections. However, my friendly waitress told me about their lunch specials, including a \""healthy\"" slab of quiche baked with feta, house roasted turkey, tomatoes, spinach and onions. This $10 special was served with a substantial side of greens and a generous fresh fruit cup. \n\nUm, YUM. I love quiche in general, but this particular slab (not exaggerating here) was creamy, well made and finished with a tasty crust. It was quite a nice portion for a ten spot, especially for lunch. The turkey was ridiculously good and I was really impressed with the quality of the quiche. \n\nI'd really like to come back and give their breakfast/brunch a shot as the red velvet waffles were taunting me."
1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!\nI had been craving sushi for a while, so I figured Vegas would be the place to get my fix!  We decided on Social House and both the bf and me were very happy with our pick!\n\nMade a reservation for 6pm (Saturday night), as we had a show to get to by 7:30.  Perfect timing - we were in and out pretty quickly, because we glanced at the menu while waiting at the bar for our table.  The decor is very sexy - the lounge/seating area is parted by a curtain so you forget you're actually in a shopping center.  Instead, whisked away into a dreamland of great food... haha :) \n\nWe shared an appetizer of Shichimi Confit Butter Potatoes, yummm! Then enjoyed 3 of their specialty rolls - Hamachi (with jalapeno/cilantro green sauce and garlic chips), Sun Dried Tomato (vegetarian roll), and a Battera roll with shrimp, spicy tuna and avocado.  (I learned that a Battera roll is layered into a box shape instead of the traditional circular rolls - different and fun!)  Did I just die and go to specialty roll heaven?  Yes, yes I did.  \n\nAbsolutely delicious and wouldn't change a thing about this place.  Of course the prices were up there, but c'mon, you're in Vegas.  Money ain't a thang."
0,"This is based off just one visit when I ordered the BBQ chicken. I haven't had that much eastern NC BBQ but this chicken tasted over cooked and it was overly soggy, like boiled chicken. \n\nThe atmosphere is very inviting, plaid/checkered table covers, paper plates & plastic utensils, friendly staff.\n\nI hope to return soon and update my review ( :"
1,"Black jeans, grey shirt, black tie and black Chucks. Sounds like something out of every hip GQ man's closet, my closet. As cool as I dress, sorry to disappoint, that is your waiter's wardrobe my friend. \n\nSuper sexy and super loud. Decor is modern and cool as heck with their M16 lamps. Yep, you heard me, M16s! I couldn't read the chalk, but rumor is someone wrote the Art of War up there. I guess the M16's make sense now!\n\nFood is A-okay, a lil' pricey though. My only gripe is about the bartender (see ART of Yelp), as I have not forgotten."
0,"Hands down WORST pizza I have ever had. I ordered a New York style thin crust pizza with pepperoni.  Mannn... this \""pizza\"" came out with more grease than an auto shop! The dough was thick and soggy in the middle and the cheese tasted like rubber. To top it off the waitress/bartender said \""Wow! Doesn't that look good?\""  HAHAHA SERIOUSLY?! Maybe she's never had a pizza before, but this was pure nastiness.  My bf and I just looked at each other and laughed. Sorry Nikki Lee's... nice people working there and you may make good drinks, but PLEASE refrain from calling that ball of grease on my table a \""pizza\""."
0,"Our server was great! He was on the ball and friendly, and he did not judge us when we didn't order drinks!\n\nThe shrimp & clam soup was very good. The small deserts were pretty good - definitely a great size. I wish though that they offered other options besides the small individual servings.\n\nOur entrees were bland. In order to stay under the 475 calorie rule, they have skimped on many spices/additions that make meals so tasty! Also, the filet was very large - I would have rather had a smaller cut with more taste!\n\nWe will not be going back on our own, however, if someone we are meeting would like to go there, then we will not complain."

1,"Nice service. Spacious rooms. Kind of on the outskirt of the strip, so it's a bit calmer. Typical hotel. Great prices. Only stayed here for a night, so there's not much to say or complain about. Even though I stayed here over 5 years ago they are still sending me mail."
1,"Visted BurGR twice this week.  I couldn't resist going back the next day.  Waiter Alex with the glasses recommended the Chanterelle BurGR with goat cheese.  YUMMY.  Honestly the best burgr I have ever had.  The Parmesan fries & sweet potatoe fries were excellent choices also.  The next day I had the Brittania (?) BurGR - also great.  The coffee shake was amazing, but better with a little less pudding the second day.  I would highly recommend it.  I love GR!"
1,"I have been here twice and it was excellent both times.  Great atmosphere.  Attentive service, but not overly so.  Good wine and drink list.  I had the scallops as an entr\u00e9e both times.  Delicious!  Tried a variety of the appetizers.  All excellent!  Definitely a top choice in Charlotte."
0,"If you're looking for authentic mexican - this is NOT the place for you.  If you are looking for a Tex Mex BBQ joint masking as a Fine Mexican restuarant this IS the place for you.  We tried the shredded beef tacos and shredded pork burro.  The tacos were good - not as good as Los Dos Molinos or Guedo's though.  The burro had so much BBQ sauce I could only eat about 1/3 before I gave up.  The rice was delicious and the refried beans were ok - a little too much BBQ sauce again.  The chips and salsa were good.  Drinks were a little expensive - $4.25 for Dos Equis.  Service was almost too effecient.  It seemed they wanted us out of there quickly - never asked if we wanted another drink and kept coming back to clear plates.  Very nice service staff, simple atmosphere, nice patio,  prices a little too high.  Not authentic enough for me to return."
1,"My friends took me to this restaurant while I was visiting them in Nevada. Being from Southern California I am a bit of a foodie, but I'm not a food snob, my philosophy is  as long as it tastes amazing I'm usually a happy camper. \n\n My friends said that they were taking me to their \""regal beagle\"". I laughed and said ok this should be interesting. When we approached the restaurant it's in a strip mall, like any causal dining location. When I entered the place it was open, casual , clean and quaint. they had a cute kids corner, which was nice as we had my friend's daughter with us.   \n\nWe were warmly greeted and everyone was so nice from the hostess, the waitress and even the chefs themselves.  The head Chef made it a point to talk to every table in that restaurant.   \n\nThe food was spectacular and delicious.  The clam chowder is creamy and  the chef adds a hint of sherry to give it that extra richness and add body to the flavor.  My friend order the salmon with scampi.  Now I do not eat salmon except at sushi, because it seems as though everyone does not properly cook it and its mushy.  I tried his salmon and I am convinced that next time that I visit this is what I plan to order.  I had the Beef Kabob and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  My other friend ordered the  salad was giant and very fresh.\n\n I would recommend this place to everyone.  If your willing to drive away from the stip, and experience some great food at a very reasonable price, you have to check this place out!!!"
0,"food not hot, no flavor. people were nice."
0,"This is for the Echo Canyon trail.\n\nThis is probably one of my least favorite valley hikes. It looks cool from the road, and people talk about it like it's something so amazing, but It's way too crowded. A lot of the people who hike here seem to be competing with everyone, and are quite rude. No response to hello, and at least one occasion I have heard people talk trash about fellow hikers who they have passed.\n\nParking is severely limited. I like my mountains mountainy. On this trail, you go up about a million stair steps before getting to anything good. That is, if the parade of d-bags doesn't turn you off enough to leave. \n\nIt did kick my ass the couple times I've hiked it though, so that's good. The best time to go is early in the morning, when it's still dark out. Bring head lamps."
0,"Don't ever come here!! The food is amazing, but it's not worth the terrible service. I have come here with friends about 8 times, hoping each time the service will be better, but no luck. I once waited an hour and 23 minutes for my food. It has become a game for us, how long will it take for a draft beer to come to our table? 32 minutes!! I ordered a steak one night, and was still working on it when the waitress picked it up to take it away. I told her I was not done, and she held the plate for me to eat it out of her hand! I finished my steak with her holding it for me, and she stormed off as if I was an inconvenience for her. Another time we told them we had a group of about 12 people coming, and I was told we are not allowed to have more than 6 people. I looked in the dining room and there was noone in there. I asked if we could push some tables together for our large group and they said no. It's such a shame because their food is amazing and their signature cocktails are delicious. Unfortunately, I will not be going back again."
1,"very tasty food and generous portion size. Efficient and pleasant staff. My spouse\nenjoyed an excellent beer. This was our second visit and we went for \""restaurant week\""\nIt was a very pleasant dinner and I highly recommend this restaurant"
1,Usual layout. Staff was friendly.
1,No frills store but a great place to find a wide variety of toys and treats for your dog at really discounted prices. I wish they carried a larger selection of premium dog foods (what they have is fairly limited) but if you're looking for toys and dog snacks then this is the place to go.
0,"Ive been going to this mall since high school. I used to work here, in fact.\n\nMan has it gone down hill. It seems more akin to what AZ Mills used to be like when it 1st opened, than the \""cool\"" mall that everyone wanted to go to. They still have a Body Language, a Just Sports, and a Fast Fix here....and thats just about the only reason I go here anymore. Sometimes to Sears as well. All the good places in the food court have closed, along w/ most of the autonomous units for mid-mall snacking have closed, or become some lesser version of what they were. \n\nThis place is kind of an overall disappointment."
1,"Did the quick lunch thing and loved it. Bibimbap was pretty close to best in town. Atmosphere very relaxed and can get crowded and BUSY around lunch time, but well worth the wait. Oh yeah, under 15$ all in and a great deal for the meal. Enjoy..."
0,Always out of chicken. Staff in a hurry and throws your food around. They act like you are bothering them.
1,this place is the best the big meaty beef ribs to dim sum was the best my family loved it the prices are cheap and good or you can take some to go. this is our stop for dinner not too far from the strip. and the staff is helpful and quiet .and the seating is booth and chairs and tables.
0,"I have been filling my prescriptions at this location since last September. Really only because I moved to this side of town.the pharmacy is so busy that even with all the staff they have the pharmacy staff and pharmacists can't keep up and provide the customer service I think they would like to. The wait is always horrible. If you fill your prescription online or call it in, it is never done by the pick up time you request. I'm sure if they build another CVS close to this location it would help lighten this stores load."
0,"The atmosphere is very nice and quite comfortable. That's the good part of our visit to Toros. I found the food lacking any seasoning or taste. Has the chief heard of salt or pepper. Portions are very small, we ordered the braised rib we got one piece which was about 3 inches by 3 inches over mashed potatoes cost $8. I understand small plates but most tapas restaurants plates are at least large enough for 2 people to share. At best the food is bland  and not worth the prices they charge. I certainly hope they rework the food. I don't mind paying more for really good food, but I do mind being overcharged for poor food. I don't normally compare one restaurant to another since each should be able to stand on their own but honestly FireFly is hands down so much better."
0,Took these people 5 hours to put 2 rear brake pads on my car. Could've shown my child how to do it faster. Only good part was family feud was on the TV the whole time. Never again
1,"This place is hit or miss! When it hits, it's the 4th best BBQ in Phoenix, but honestly that's saying quite a bit. 1 - Bryan's 2 - Bobby Q 3- Famous Dave's 4 - Shane's Last - Dickies, Joes Real BBQ, and McD's McRib."
1,"Good for a small stop and satisfy sushi craving. Try the monkey collections as they have a good blend of flavors. The good thing is their happy hour, I been there twice now, only at this time."
1,I really love thus pizza best of all! The meat lovers is my favorite for a regular day. When we are in the mood for some spicy... The southwestern chicken pizza is insane good! The boneless chicken wings are awesome. Me being very picky with chicken I think these are hands down better than buffalo wild wings for sure. If your in the mood for pizza thus is the place to eat!!!
1,"Prompt and efficient service. I left a message the night before and they returned my call first thing in the morning. Professional and friendly I was a referral from a friend, and I will refer others."
1,"Mon restaurant d\u00e9jeuner favori dans le coin! Les oeufs b\u00e9n\u00e9dictines sont savoureux. Par contre, l'endroit est plut\u00f4t petit et le menu plut\u00f4t limit\u00e9."
0,"Things I know about Five Guys:\n\n1. They displaced In & Out on Zagats;\n2. According to my husband, one order of fries can feed three people;\n3. According to a good friend (who shall remain anonymous) \""Yeah, it's good, but I can eat at In & Out for half the price.\""\n\nI agree with all three. \n\nI went to the food court for lunch after a fine time at Nordstrom with the express desire to have a chicken caesar at Ranch One Chicken, but they were gone (I don't get to this mall very often). So, after looking around I decided to try Five Guys to see what all the hype was about. When I left, I felt robbed.\n\nYeah, the food was fine. Not brilliant by burger standards, but fine. I threw away about half the fries because, generous though the serving was, I was by myself and didn't need to feed three people. They also had an incredibly cool soda machine with loads of flavors but it was on the seltzery side. And throughout the afternoon I couldn't shake my frustration over the amount of money I'd spent.\n\nIf I want to spend that kind of money, I'll go to Fez."
0,"So bad , using bad chicken which is overdate and tasty like shit. Smell so bad with gongbao chicken.  I promise I will never ever back."
0,"Hostess is way too snotty. Menu is way too big. Servers are way too rushed (they really wanna' turn & burn your table). And food is way too pricey for what you get. Will go back if someone else reeeeeaaally wants to go, but otherwise - will feel belittled and rushed for less money somewhere else."
1,If you haven't visited yet... you are missing out! The best place in the Henderson/Anthem area to get your juices! Top quality products and very knowledgeable staff. Come get your vape on!!
1,"Great cupcakes!!!\n\nMy buddy, Darren and I are Cupcake fans and have visited many cupcake shops in the valley.  Kreative Kupcakes is definitely one of the best!!!!  They have over 24 flavors available and they are always fresh and taste amazing!   Leah is very friendly and is very passionate about her cupcakes!!!  There is plenty of room to sit and enjoy your tasty treat.  It is even served on a plate, which no one else does that.  Also one of the most inexpensive cupcake shop out there!  She also has other items like cheesecake with is to die for!!!!\n\nVery nice experience!\n\nI would highly recommend Kreative Kupcakes!!"
1,32 SHEA is a fun little coffee shop. Great atmosphere and fun staff. This was the first place I ever had Nutella in my coffee. So Yummy! Check it out!
1,"This bar really has two distinct personalities. There is the original bar which has a few taps, but mostly bottles & cans. It is more of a traditional dive bar and has the major label beers (plus some of the forgotten brews that are more nostalgic now such as Hamm's & PBR). I was impressed that I checked in and received a Yelp coupon for 50% off of my first drink. I had a tall Red Stripe, a Hamm's, and a PBR for a grand total of $6. \n\nNext door, or through the door in inside the bar, is a second version of the bar. This has a whole different feel. It is more of a craft beer, newer bar. Unlike the chalk board menu next door, this section of the bar has electronic menus with a good assortment of micro-brews. Each of the ones I had on this side were $6 each. \n\nA huge highlight for me was the menu. I ordered a Sonoran hot dog for $3.95. Being engaged to a lady from Sonora I have had several from various places. The Sonoran hot dog here was probably the best I have ever had. And it was cheap! \n\nI like this place because it does have two different personalities and depending on your mood, one of them will be right for you. I like the newer side with a good selection of draughts and bottles. Not to mention the hot dog!"
0,"I was very excited to stay at the Sanctuary, but left VERY disappointed. The Spa Suites are poorly furnished and everything decorated in green. The bedroom has two large unattractive lamps that look like they came from Ikea with yellow lighting. The shower is open air so we felt cold after exiting the shower. There is NO tub in the room. The reservationist said there was- but what she failed to say is it is on the deck ouside. We had breakfast the next day in the dining room and it took 20 minutes to get our eggs with only three other tables with guests We were also doubled billed. I asked that one of our suites be split between my husband's card and mine. We rent two suites for two nights I would not stay here again.."
1,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I pulled into the strip mall parking lot.  I saw the name on the storefront, but was a little thrown with large signs advertising sandwiches, salads and soup.  I stepped into the establishment to find a casual set-up of a few tables and chairs.  \n\nI was looking forward to the Scandanavian choices that fellow Yelpers had raved about.  I first picked up one menu that offered the mundane offerings of sandwiches and soups that you can get anywhere else.  But then I found their second menu containing all the goodies I had been looking for.  I decided to go with the baked cod, beet salad, potato salad, spinach salad and rosti (large hashbrown).\n\nMy lunch came out completely filling the plate, including an extra plate for the rosti (which I took home).  The fish was delicately cooked to perfection accompanied by the colorful salads.  I attempted to finish my plate, but wanted to savor every bite.  Delightful, with leftovers!\n\nI overheard the owner say they were moving locations soon, so call before you go so you don't miss out."
0,"Every since this new director has taken over, this place has turn from decent to extremly terrible. I recently took my daughter out. Every day I took her to daycare there was a new teacher. All the teacher that had been employess for numberous years either quit or walked out. The director has a very impatient uncaring attitude. Not someone I would have taking care of children or supervising people that did. All the teachers look extremely stressed and unhappy and who does that affect? The children. My daughter had a bathroom incident and was wet when I picked her up. No one bothered to change her. She was crying in a corner when I came in. In a months time I received 3 calls telling me my child was injured. Never resolved. You get charged fees without prior knowledge of why! If you want a piece of mind when you drop your child off definately dont take them here!!!!!!!!!! I dont know how the other childrens choice centers are. You cant judge all of them for one bad apple, meaning the current director at palace station child care. Dont think you can complain and get results either because the director is also friends with the regional director connie. Severeal witnesess have heard these two laugh about parents complaints after pretending to address them. What a joke!!!!! Who hired this lady!  After nearly half the staff quits or walks out wouldnt it seem like someone would try and investigate why? guess not cause she is still there. I have talked to other parents  who had children attending there, they was taken out to, reason.....all the same. New director!!!!!!! I know this place has lost money and children."
1,"good\uff0c u can Order in the morning , pick up at night ! The most important thing is the price is good !"
1,"Boba (aka Bubble Tea (aka Tapioca)) is fantastic here.\n\nBack in California, we have a boba chain called Tea Station and Ten Ren's.  Theirs is the best I've ever tasted and Rose Tea Cafe is comparable.  \n\nTheir Green Milk Tea (or jasmine milk tea in other places) was the perfect hint of tea.  The consistency was not too thin or thick.  Their actual tapioca balls... I don't recall whether they were exceptional but they weren't bad.  \n\nThe food is pretty good and comes in healthy portions.\n\nNow, the BAD...  the wait is absolutely ridiculous.  If you come around dinnertime- 6p or 7p, you really have to wait an hour for two people.  It's also a very narrow room so the waitresses are constantly tripping around people waiting by the door.\n\nI just advise that you come around 8 or 9p or a lot earlier in the day."
0,"As far as location, it doesn't get better than Paris, however that's about the only thing Paris has going for it.\nThe hotel is pretty from a far and seems fancy but it's nothing special when you actually spend time in the casino and restaurants.\nMy real reason for giving this hotel only 1 star is because of the staff. By far the worst, unhelpful, rude, miserable staff I've ever encountered (and I'm from NYC)...\nThe reception/front desk are not welcoming at all. They don't want to answer your questions and they just blow you off. The waiters and clerks all look like they're in pain working there and they never crack one smile.\nThe only good thing, like I stated is the location. But for the same view and location, I would recommend staying at Planet Hollywood."
0,This place is dirty and has a very distinct oder that smells like feet. The food when fresh must taste good but I would not know as everything I had tasted as if it was out all day. On top of that it is expensive... so that's nice. Lol
1,"= = = = = =  WEEKDAY BREAKFAST BUFFET!  = = = = = =\n\nI stopped in here for the first time this morning to give the breakfast buffet a try.  I found it to be a friendly, clean & comfortable coffee shop type restaurant (ala Denny's), featuring a daily breakfast buffet from 6 AM.  \n\nThere were about 35 different morning munchies out including various kinds of cold cereal, fruits (mostly canned), & scrambled eggs that you can fancy up with sliced, sauteed mushrooms, onion slices, cheese sauce, salsa, & more.  There was hot cereal too, Potatoes Au Gratin, bacon, pork sausage, pancakes, french toast, & more.  In fact, my favorite items were the biscuits & gravy, the Potatoes O'Brien, & the Corned Beef Hash.\n\nNow this is no Verona Chophouse, but it's also $6, not $20!  I thought it was very good for the money."
0,"I went there for lunch using the buffet of buffets pass.  The wait to enter was long, so I was hoping that the food will be worth the wait.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  People seem to be raving about the crepes, but I found them to not be that great.  I had better.  The service (drinks) was slow.  The overall quality of the food is mediocre at best.  The only good thing was the \""saumon fume\"".   As for the quality and selection of their \""French\"" food, they were not anything special.  The buffet at the Wynn has better French selection."
0,"No. No. No. And No. \n\nNot what I expected. Not thrilling, Not exciting, and NOT worth the price. (Whatever that may be because my tickets were compd)\n\nI must admit, the costumes were pretty dope! The theatre was awesome and clearly they have put in a ton of mulah into all that equipment used on stage but holy cow, this was a painfully boring show! \n\nThere were a couple scenes that had me but for the majority of the show I struggled staying awake. This was a very long play...with great sound effects and beautiful background projection scenes. However, the performances were boring and mediocre. That battle scene that was taken out due to the tragic accident appeared to have been the highlight of this show. This was replaced with cartoon montage...looked cool but must have been awesome seeing the real thing. \n\nI would never pay full price to see this, but if they offer discounted tickets, for sure worth snagging a couple."
0,"Sonoma is totally forgettable. There was nothing wrong with the place, except for maybe the overly effected service (the waiter who responds to \""thank you\"" with \""thank you\"" instead of \""your welcome\""). If someone who loved this restaurant wanted to take me back I'd go, but I won't go there by choice again."
0,"Ok before you read any further you must know that I am not an Alice Cooper fan. So that taints my view of the restaurant. \n\nThat being said the food was below average. The club sandwich was dry and lacked flavor. The restaurant was also really large and seemed cluttered (probably due to all the memorabilia), and surprisingly full for lunch today (Thursday). So I may be the only one with this opinion."
1,"Juan's Flaming Fajitas is a surprising great dining experience that is only 8 miles from my apartment. Don't know how I missed it and or never heard about it till last night.\n\nFirst pyromaniacs will love this place! The name \""Flaming Fajitas\""  is well deserved and quite frankly and understatement. When they bring your Fajitas out the server ignites the dish and the flames shoot 3 to 4 feet into the air! \n\nThe food was top notch fresh and flavorful. The only negative experience of the entire night was in relationship to their cheese dish I ordered to go along with my chips. It had to be cut with a knife and fork and couldn't be spooned up by a nacho chip. It had great flavor but I won't order it again as it was to much effort for chips and dip.\n\nThe wait staff was great, drinks were never more than half empty, the complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip was similarly filled whenever they appeared low. We had one main waiter but he was getting help from everyone else on the staff and he was helping out the other waiters and their tables. It would appear they are a highly functional unit that wasn't worried about sharing their tables tips. Simply stated it was a true pleasure to dine here.\n\nYou could read that and guess it was a slow night but no, there was only one maybe two empty tables in the entire restaurant. \n\nIf you live near or far you must come experience this dining experience its something you will not regret!"
0,"Being next door to corporate you would have higher expectations. \n\nThe breakfast bar is lame. Back home (fayette county) there seems to be a lot more variety such as corn fritters, apple cinnamon \""thingies\"", and little potato cakes to name a few. The salad bar is just as bad, the side dishes they offer are usually ruined with meat which makes no sense to me because the tiny ham cubes and bacon bits are already on the bar so if anyone wanted to add them into their linguini salad or whatever, they could.\n\nThe late night patrons are a bit unsavory, speaking of which, my ex roommate used to work here and I could tell you some stories but I don't want to freak you out."
1,"Some amazing shit. Takeout chinese food except it comes out in 5 minutes max, sometimes 30 seconds. I know all Chinese takeout food is unhealthy so I'm not concerned about the health implications OE may or may not have, I just enjoy the food. It tastes delicious and the portions are huge, what more could you ask for?"
1,"Didn't know what to order here so left it up to the waitress to determine my tastebud's fate. She asked us simple questions and ordered items based off of that keeping in mind a budget we provided to her. Overall, I would give her an 8 out of 10 for her effort.\n\nIt's been weeks since I've been so sometimes, that really helps me remember what was memorable if I mention it in my review. The uni was super fresh here! There was also a mushroom dish that came with a poached egg on top, that was also to die for. I also really enjoyed the sea bass yakitori, this dissolved in your mouth like cotton candy! The sushi rolls that came out wasn't anything special, but knowing that, I'll probably stick to some of their more inventive dishes. The dessert was some kind of banana flavored one- can't remember how to describe it, but it was a winner in my book.\n\nOverall- it isn't too bad of a spot to check out at least once if you want to try something new. The likelihood of me returning is not that high but based on that one experience alone (along with the service), it was a solid 4 stars!"
0,"Ate breakfast here before my flight. I really expected more.  The service was terrible.  The egg white sandwich on a pretzel roll sounded great, but it was very poor.   There was absolutely no care in the assembly of the sandwich and the \""hash browns\"" were just a deep fried triangle potato patty.  \n\nUnfortunately it's the airport, and when you give a long term exclusive contract to one operator, there is no concern for quality."
0,"Cheap food doesn't make up for quality - especially in this instance. The one saving grace is the customer service. \n\nPretty sure chicken comes pre-cubed/ pre packaged; food is otherwise bland and tasteless. Salsa virtually has no flavor - how is that even possible?\n\nI wouldn't recommend this place, although I can see it appearing on TV with Gordon Ramsay."
1,"Hands down this is the best Japanese restaurant in Northwest Las Vegas. They not only have a huge sushi bar, but they also serve my favorite Japanese dishes. Great atmosphere, friendly staff and clean. The food is really fresh and really good. However, ever since the Olive's Garden opened next door, there are now twice as many customers as before, which translate to waiting a bit before getting a table during peak hours."
1,"Being a vegetarian isn't always the easiest lifestyle to live.  People tease you, and give you odd looks when its brought up in conversation.  And god forbid a meal at mom and dad's goes by without someone making mention of your weird eating habits.  \nIts a good thing that Green came along to help strengthen our resolve. and more importantly, to help convince non-vegetarians that vegans and vegetarians aren't a bunch of weirdos who eat soy-paste and lentils all day.  \nWith a wide array of options on their menu, Green has enough variety to please pretty much everyone, vegan or not.  After eating here at least twice a week for the last few months I've come close to sampling the entire menu, and there really isn't a bad thing that I can say about it.  The mock chicken and the phoney beef  used in Green's sammy's are alarmingly accurate in both flavor and texture.  The curry bowls are some of the best I've had, and the orecciette pasta with chicken  parmesan is worth killing for - which is saying a lot in vegan circles.\nBottom line:  if you're in the neighborhood, you'd be a fool not to stop in and sample some of the items on the menu.  If you don't find something at green that you absolutely love, you may want to see a doctor, because there is a good chance that you are dead and haven't realized it yet.\nFinally, if the slew of rave reviews here on yelp hasn't convinced you yet, you can check out Green's menu right here:\n\nhttp://www.greenvegetarian.com/menu.jpg"
0,I had this place on my list but I didnt make in time because it is now closed.\n\nThe reviews here are varied and so are the ones elsewhere. Suppossedly thiey had deep fried hamburgers like Dyers in Memphis.\n\nSad to see it go but there must have been a reason
0,"I used to love Shucks, and it was my go-to neighborhood bar. Back in the day, they had fantastic 2lb crab buckets for under $30. When people would ask me my favorite thing about Las Vegas, those affordable crab buckets would be part of my reply- mostly because you can order them 24 hrs a day. Crab at 3am? Why not?\n\nThose  days are long gone now. The menu has changed, the late night specials have changed, the bar staff has changed. They used to offer a great late night menu after midnight (pics posted) but no more, now it's just breakfast. There's two bartenders who work there late night, one is a darling, the other who is newer is so rude.\n\nThe crab is now $9 for 1/2 a pound, which is  just kind of silly. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's only so-so. The tuna is previously frozen, which is what you would expect from a place like this and sometimes it's okay, sometimes it's inedible. The oysters seem to be popular but they're gulf oysters which really isn't my thing.\n\nI used to love this place and would come at least a couple of times a week, but no longer. I'll still drop in once in a while if the bartender I like is working. And it's still a great place to get seafood late at night, but for your bar needs? You can do better."
0,"I wish I could say that my complaints are isolated to this single store. They are not.\n\nThe food is cheaply done for a not so cheep price. One dish tends to taste like five others that they have. Like its the same sauce,  just with different meats and sometimes vegetables. \nIt feels like the place belongs in the food court of a mall. Not near a Goodwell. I suppose its location can tell you something about the quality of food one is going to get.\n\nThe employee always look over work and seem to not enjoy being there. It makes it feel like I have slave labor preparing my food. Which is a little disconcerting. \n\nThe bathrooms are not to bad, but at timea are filthy. At least the food and dining area look clean most if the time.\n\nI can't recommend this place as I avoid eating here myself."
0,"Holy overrated Batman!  I've eaten here twice...once several years ago and once just about a month ago...and nothing has changed.  You still have to wait, even if you can get a reservation, the ambiance is horrible, and the selection is limited.  I'm a picky person about my pizza, and don't get me wrong, I enjoy all of the food at Biancos.....however is the best pizza I've ever had?  No....is it better than what you find in New York?  No....is it worth the 4 hour wait?  God no.  Do yourself a favor....save a couple hours of your life and go down the street to Cibo's....the pizza is just as good, salads and desserts are better, atmosphere is better and the longest I've ever waited there was an hour."
0,"As others have said, this place should not purport to be a \""Medical\"" weight loss clinic. It truly is a \""get what you pay for - here are some pills that will help - you figure it out - and don't die in the meantime.\""  \n\nThe staff is friendly and tries to be helpful.  It isn't their fault that their employer has not designed a system that will provide truly supervised medical weight loss. But if you want quick and easy access to B12 shots and appetite suppressants, this place will serve you well. I wanted to lose 6 pounds and I did it in three weeks.  \n\nIf you have serious weight loss needs or truly want someone to show you the way, this is not the place for you."
1,The selection is so overwhelming in a good way. I had eggs benedict. The eggs were perfectly cooked so many placed kill the eggs. I was a happy camper. Plus going on a Tuesday you get double stamps on their free meal card.
1,Good mixes and great yogurt.  Probably our favorite yogurt place.
1,"This is a Michelin rated (1-star) restaurant and comes with the bells and whistles you'd expect. My wife had the blue cheese crusted filet, which was tender and tasty. I had the 18-oz bone-in ribeye. It was the best ribeye I've had in a long time. It was not as thick and lean as Ruth's Chris and not as thin and fatty as Smith & Wollensky or Donovan's. Most amazingly, it was almost as tender as my wife's filet. This is not a steak house per say, but this steak rocked."
0,"If you know what you're getting into it's probably ok.  The salsa and chips is not like other Mexican restaurants in any way.  I was not a huge fan and they charge if you want extra chips.  Tacos are mostly authentic style with cilantro and onions not American with lettuce, tomato etc.\n\nIt's a small place and as others have said the service is sufficient but not overly impressive.  The prices are certainly reasonable, but I will check out some other Mexican restaurants to see if I can do better."
1,"I loved the fried catfish - not greasy but flaky and tasty!  I'd never had grits before so I have no idea how good they are to the GP, only that I THOUGHT THEY WERE DELICIOUS!  What a nice surprise!  The greens were tasty with a slow burn that sneaks up.  The mac and cheese was VERY cheesy.  Good flavor yet I just couldn't eat much.  Really rich!  Now to the chicken.  It was OK.  I think I expected a different flavor or preparation so I was a little disapointed, but I ate it because it was good anyway...just not - YUM, like the catfish (personal preference)  Enjoy!"
1,"Stopped by Discount Tire to get a nail taken out of my rear tire and filled. As soon as I walked in a gentlemen came out from behind the counter and welcomed me into the store. He assessed my tire and entered all of my info into the computer and said it would be about 30minutes. He was extremely friendly. I waited outside for about 25min and another gentleman pulled my car up front and said everything had been completed and they checked the pressure on my other tires as well. When I asked how much he smiled and said \""Free, we hope that you come back and buy tires from Discount\"". I absolutely will! I bought my last set from Walmart and they were a nightmare. What an exceptional experience."
0,"My husband was looking forward to eating here because he's seen Hubert Keller on PBS.  Great atmosphere, service, etc., but disappointing food.  The meal started great with grilled octopus which was stellar but it was downhill from there.  The angus sliders were good but the truffle oil mac n cheese bordered on tasteless.  The meatballs were meh as was the tarte flambee.  Since only one out of 5 items were anything special we didn't even bother with dessert.  Next time we'll try one of other restaurants in the casino."
0,"I'm disappointed, we dine here for a lot of occasion. We ordered a rather\nLarge bone in ribeye.$54.00 This steak was seared at such a high temp\nThat it was burnt on the outside and very rare on inside. I  couldn't  tell\nYou how it was seasoned I could only taste BURNT! We did not eat it.\nAnd did not want another steak. I chose to take it home for our dogs.\nWhen I got it home and looked at it I was pissed. To see it in the light\nThis steak was so burnt, I would of asked for our money back!\nI plan on calling and letting them know. I plan on going back for drinks\nAnd side dishes. We do like this place a lot. But this was the worst experience ever."
0,"I am a burger fanatic. I travel all over the world looking for a great burger. Now that always depends on price/value for me to rate the place. Heart Attack is a fun concept. The bottomless fries are a nice touch. The nurses are a nice distraction, but let me know digress. I went there for the burger. \n\nFor value, nope.\nFor taste, nope.\nFor hype, yep. \nFor concept, yep.\nFor execution, nope.\nFor price/value, nope.\n\nFor me the burger did not compare to Five Guys or In N Out.\nIf you are going to hype a great burger then deliver a great burger.\nIf the prices were lower then my expectation would have been lowered as well.\n\nInstead, the prices are  high. The smell of grease is over whelming.\nThe biggest disappointment was they they sold nothing to show others I survived.\n\nSo great concept. \nWorth one visit to take some photos in the wheel chair with the nurses. \n\nOther wise go to the In N Out and order an animal protein style with fries well done. \nIf you can't find an In N Out then go to Five Guys. Either way you get a better burger at a better price."
1,"The food is great! no doubt!  The resturant is pretty cool too.  My kids actually enjoy the place, and eat the food and they always get to pick their favorite candy when they are done from all the old fashion candies.  Every once and awhile their line gets backed up pretty far, but i guess most resturants have that problem on a Saturdays.  The problem could be fixed with a little rearranging of a few things but it isn't that big of a deal.  We will go back many times in the future."
0,"Crowded, mashups, girls all wearing the same clothes, horrible booze (like poison-you horrible), $12 drinks, $450 bottles. Not my scene but the club was pretty/well appointed. Many floors. Might be someone else's idea of a fun night, but it definitely wasn't mine."
1,Open super late.   Great pizza.  Interesting crowds.   Always fun
1,Great Place. Real causual and relaxed. All of their food is great. Honestly one of the best itallian joints in Arizona!!\n\nAlso some great seafood/italian dishes that are hard to find anywhere else!!
0,"Went here to celebrate my girlfriends 21st due to all the good reviews about this place and between ordering a appetizer of sushi to start off with and walking out the place it was nothing but a complete waste of time and money. The service was horrible unlike the reviews. The sushi took 40 min to arrive the entree another 30 and was cold when it did. The manager just made excuses of how it was busy at the time, that's doesn't explain why my foods cold does it? In the end I paid the $93 dollar sushi bill seeing how I didn't even bother touching the ice cube they called salmon and rice and we headed to cookout for a hamburger tray and a milkshake all under $10. If I could give no stars I would."
0,"Worst experience ever ordered a Ham and Cheese Hoagie and got a philly Steak. Took it back and in broken English the cook says No that's what you ordered and walked away. Will NEVER go there again. New Cooks, place sucks now. Spent 30.00 and they screwed up order and said that's what I ordered turned there back to me and walked away. I WAS the one who returned the incorrect order through the window, since the cook and cashiers attitude sucked and they just turned there back and said that what you ordered. Not my fault you don't understand English. Gonna post everywhere. Don't eat here unless you want to be treated like shit when they screw up your order."
0,"I love Smith's... just not this location.\n\nReason 1: I purchased spoiled meat from here.  Gross.\n\nReason 2: I slipped and fell in a mystery puddle inside the store while carrying my 2 year old.  Embarassing and annoying... I waited 15 minutes, spoke to 2 different employees and nobody did anything. No \""cleanup near the front entrance\"" blaring over the intercom... nothing.  Employee 1 just kept on doing what he was doing (restocking) only on the other side of the display (ummm... I can still see you, dude.  You're 2 feet taller than the display) and Employee 2 did the same... only, employee 2 is a \""greeter\"".\n\nReason 3: Same \""greeter\"" different shopping trip told me he didn't feel like looking in the back for me for an advertised product that they had run out of on the shelves because \""its Wednesday, we just got a shipment, it'd be impossible to find anything\""... oddly enough this was the same answer from the lady he brushed me off on.  Only, lady added a \""honey, you just don't get it!\"" as well as a \""check back tomorrow... or maybe the day after\""\n\nSweetheart, I DO get it.  You're busy AND lazy AND understaffed. I am a working mother and do not have the luxury of driving back and forth to the grocery store day after day with the hopes of finding an advertised product in stock.\n\nReason 4: This is in an older shopping plaza.  The parking and general traffic is horrendous.\n\nBottom Line:\nGo to Smith's just not this location.  Try the one on Rainbow just past Robindale... That one is pretty new and the employees practically bend over backwards to make sure you leave happy."
0,Very disappointed. The last time my boyfriend and I were here we had the Evo salad and the bolognese and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. Tonight's dinner was different however. Not only was the kale overcooked on the salad but the homemade pasta was stiff and lacking in flavor. I have been raving about this place and the Evo salad all week but tonight was definitely a let down. We were served our entrees before we even finished our salad and ordered a bottle of wine which we intended to have with our dinner but it too came out before we had even finished our before dinner cocktails. Not sure we will be back.
0,"We booked a package to see the Grand Canyon South Rim. The price offered a 15 hour narrated tour with lunch. \n\n Here are the package details: \n-Includes complimentary wake-up service & pick from most major hotels on the strip and downtown area!     Enjoy Danish, Juice, Coffee & Tea\n- Depart from our tour center after check-in located just minutes off the Las Vegas Strip    \n- Professional driver / guides will narrate throughout the tour\n- Photo stop of the Hoover Dam taken from the amazing O'Callaghan-Tillman Bridge. \n-  See the extinct volcano \""Fortification Hill\""\n- Exclusive stop at National Geographic Visitors center with optional Imax Grand Canyon Discovery & Adventure movie\n- Visit the widest and deepest point at Grand Canyon's South rim (over 8400 ft deep and 21 miles across)\n- Includes meal voucher for the Grand Canyon National Geographic Visitors Center\n- Ride aboard a luxury double decker motor coach equipped with video monitors, restrooms & air conditioning\n- Free Show Tickets With All Tours!\n\nSounds good, right? \n\nWe are picked up at the hotel around 6am and shuttled to another building about 10 minutes away. The driver locks the passengers into the bus and proceeds to stand in the inside of the building, drinking coffee. Some of the passengers need to use the restroom and become claustrophobic after seeing about 5 or 6 other buses emptied before our bus. After 30 minutes and one passenger making 2 phonecalls to their customer service office, we are finally let off that transport bus. \n\nNext we are herded into a large hallway and split into South and West Rim tour packages. The customer service representative for the tour company apologizes for the lack of information given to us about the tour procedures. He explains that it is their busiest time of the year and we should bare with them. He also has to apologize for the heating vents set at about 80 degrees and the broken tvs which are supposed to explain the tour to us. We quickly find out that the IMAX is not free, but we are welcome to purchase it when we pay a one time fee at the next desk. \n\nAt that desk we are given stickers to wear on our chest. Our bus driver insists we cannot get on the bus unless we first put the sticker on our chest and let him draw on them with a pen.  I asked if he could just sign it in my hand and then I'd put it on in front of him, but he refused. I wonder if this way every passenger or just the women?\n\nThe buses left about an hour after schedule. Because of this, the driver informed us we were supposed to visit the hoover dam but would be skipping it to save time for the grand canyon.\n\nThe narration turned out to be the driver periodically pointing out 2 or 3 places he felt were interesting. For the rest of the 5 hour drive each way we were forced to watch a 30 minute movie about the canyon, and a box office failure, Zookeeper, and Some Las Vegas ventriloquist.  So much for an informed narration?\n\nThe lunch turned out to be a voucher for pizza hut at the national geographic center. If you purchased the IMAX you would have an hour to eat and watch it, otherwise you ate and waited for the movie to finish. We also spent 1 hour on each drive at Mcdonalds so the bus driver could get Lunch and dinner. \n\nOnce we finally got to the Canyon we only had an hour at two viewing points. It was not enough time to get the full experience. We felt rushed to get back to the bus on time. We even missed the visitor center at our first of two viewing points. A group from our tour bus couldnt get back in time and we left without them. Luckily they found their way to the bus for the 5 hour drive back. \n\nAt about 9 oclock during the drive back, the bus driver decided we had enough time for the Hoover Dam. Unfortunately my camera doesnt deal with pitch black night scenes. We were given 5 minutes to look at it from the bridge above. \n\nOverall I was quite disappointed with this trip. If anyone asked me, I'd say pay extra and go for the helicopter tour. 3 hours out of your day and a lot less hassle."
1,"Best casual sushi in Vegas. All you can eat is a great deal - make sure to leave a little room for the green tea mochi, which was the best I've ever had.\n\nSuggestions:\n\nStarters - Dynamite, Jalape\u00f1o poppers, bacon scallop skewers\n\nNigiri - smoked salmon, yellowtail, albacore, snapper, everything else \n\nRolls - Sex Bomb, Jose, 911"
1,"Nightclub review:  Love the music, love the multiple rooms, and love the people that go there to have a good time.  Staff is friendly and helpful and there to make sure you have a good time.  \n\nThe place is visual overload and Grand Central Station for over-stimulation (feel free to use that in your marketing collateral).  \n\nNice work, Marquee, you'll have us back very soon."
0,"The food is one small notch above horrible. As for night life, you should at least enter once a year when you can get your free birthday shot after you kiss a moose head mounted on the wall. (What can I say, I loves the kitsch and free alcohol.)  Otherwise, the crowd here is pretty mixed with an emphasis on \""dudes\"" and ladies with too much make up on. Their one redeeming quality is their drink specials as both stock market night and flip night are basically the only legal gambling you can participate in the downtown area. (Make sure you did actually have enough cash to foot your drink bill if you lose your coin toss on flip night.  The bartenders tend to get pissy if you cannot cover your bill.)  FYI: The bathrooms after 10 p.m. are notably disgusting."
1,This is such a great little neighborhood spot! I've been here several times since we moved to Mesa and service is always great. Food is great! I haven't had a dish that I didn't like and I've had a variety from their menu. If they forget something or make an error they most definitely make up for it before you leave. That's really all you can ask for!
0,"Does Buzzberry not use espresso shots in their iced lattes anymore? I ordered an iced latte, and they didn't use any espresso shots, but a cold premixed coffee base. It tastes horrible!"
1,"was a little apprehensive about coming here because I didn't want to go somewhere wild for dinner but we got there early enough, it wasn't bad at all. \n\nFood was AMAZING, best hot dogs I've ever had, they were mini too and you could chose from numerous toppings. \n\nThe staff was very helpful and friendly as well. \n\nWe'll definitely be coming back!"
1,"I'm not sure why anyone would bother eating in this place, when they clearly have the most awesome bar and bartender in the universe.  The 90+ martini menu is unbelievable, and everybody is really friendly.  The only downside is that it's so far out of downtown, but really, it prevents it from being overrun by DBs and...well, more DBs.\n\nMartini Bob is fantastic, the drinks are super-strong, and the atmosphere is a thousand times awesome. I haven't eaten here, and I don't plan on it; I just want to drink at the bar and watch the parade."
0,"Had pork/shrimp shu mai, crawling ant noodles, wonton soup, water, soda for $60. Shu mai had cute gold flakes on them but very greasy and falvorless. Noodles very good and clearly hand made which we appreciated but everything lacked flavor. \n\nI concede that maybe it was sooooo authentic that we didn't know what we were eating but 1.) I'm asian 2.) I've been to lots of dim sum places 3.) my mom made wonton soup for us growing up. \n\nService was good and attentive, though, which should have brought this to two stars until I got the bill. Just no way to justify the food quality for that price."
0,"Went in for my first and ONLY time (won't bother again) for a french manicure with gel coating = $35\nIssues - mediocre manicure, and uninterested nail techs, and the TV was not on for entertainment/distraction... \nThe worst part to me was that they use UV machines to assist with drying the polish - for over FORTY minutes during the painting process! This bothered my eyes and my skin, as the machines become very hot and uncomfortable. When I tried to communicate my discomfort 20 minutes in, my concerns were brushed off."
0,"We have lived at the Verona for two years and for a little more than a year of that it has been pleasant. We live in a downstairs apartment and the upstairs neighbors are extremely loud. They both work out of the apartment, one during the day and one at night. So for 24 hours a day we have to put up with a child running throughout the apartment, jumping off of furniture, kicking who know what ( and this goes on for 1, 2, and even 3 hours at a time), furniture being drug across the floors, stomping, hammering, banging, etc. we have complained to know avail. We were told to contact Metro, they laughed and said they were the wrong ones to contact. Call security which we have numerous times, still they can't hear a thing. Now we are being told that we may be too picky about quiet and without third party confirmation they won't do anything. Well if you like noises from your neighbors waking you up all night and management that turns a blind eye to it because they are \""so nice\"" move hear. Don't be fooled by the pretty exterior."
1,"So let me start by saying that when I lived in Seattle I ate thai food all the time. So I wanted to try some of the top rated thai food in phoenix.I went here for lunch today with some friends, and it was pretty good. The place was busy, but we were seated right away. The waitress promptly brought out little cups of soup (which was really yummy). A couple of my friends ordered the Phad see ew, another got the red curry, and I got the spicy noodles. Everyone liked their food, my only problem was that I ordered my spicy noodles 'hot.' They were not spicy at all. Like not even a little bit. So... maybe they were confused. The noodles were still good, I liked them, but they had absolutely no heat. Oh well, I guess I would go back, I'm curious to see what the food would taste like if it were spicy. I tried my friend's curry, which was a medium, and it was good. Also, all the lunch specials were reasonably priced at 6.95."
0,"Tastes bad, food all seems processed, and my food was ordered and ready within 30 seconds - literally. At least hold onto my food for a few minutes to make me believe the food is fresh. Wouldn't recommend, this is my first time here and I won't ever be back."
0,"I ordered the Baja Burger. I said Baja Burger. When the food came, it looked like chicken. I said, \""I ordered a burger.\"" The waitress replied, \""It's a chicken burger.\"" Being the reasonable person I am, I assumed I hadn't been paying attention (which has been known to happen) and wondered to myself why they'd put a 'chicken burger' in the burger section. I mean, I read the description - it said nothing about being chicken. Whatever, it looked good so I chalked it up to me not paying attention and let it go. The 'chicken burger' was delicious. So good. I was very pleased.\n\nThe service was pretty slow, especially after we got our food. The hostess cleared our plates and we waited patiently - for who knows how long - for our waitress to come back by. She finally dropped the check, at which point we waited a while longer - long enough for me to take a leisurely trip to the restroom - before she finally came back by to retrieve the check and run my card.\n\nOn the way to the restroom, I passed the kitchen where I saw the waitress either doing her sidework or checking out others' sidework. Either way, I had my answer as to why the service slowed to a crawl.\n\nOh, and on that check was printed, \""Baja Chicken Sandwich.\"" I checked the menu on my phone to make sure I wasn't losing my mind. I wasn't.\n\nI said burger."
1,"Met a friend for brunch and about died over how good it was. All you need to know is the following:\n\n1. You can get a pitcher of Pimm's Cup. A pitcher.\n2. Best Eggs Benedict since the old El Chorro on Lincoln. No offense to the new El Chorro, I just stopped going after you stomped all over your history with the remodel.\n3. Griddled Church Potatoes\n\nI am in LOVE with Windsor. Probably going to eat there so much it gets weird."
0,Quality of the food was poor.  Lots of choices but just didn't think the food was worth the price.\n\nThink a stand-alone place is a better choice.  You'll get better quallity food & eat less.
0,"This place sucks.  It's small, and their advertisements all over TV are BS.  They don't have any regular keno machines.  Payouts on the machine games are crap.  Only thing they have going for them is the location.  I was super excited to be able to hit a casino 30 minutes from Glendale instead of having to go out to Casino Arizona or Fort McDowell.  \n\nWon't make that mistake again."
0,Coffee Uhhh. OK.  Location great for people watching. Not helping by limiting internet to 2 hours. Staff in Sq. Hill fair to good. But to serve coffee and greet people. It's not that hard.  They don't clean up much. Until the end of the night. Pastries pretty spendy. Try not to ask too many questions you may be bothering them to talk to a customer.
0,"Breakfast Gone Wrong\nFirst,no problem with my food or my server.  About 3/4 of the way through my meal, the manager John \""Gino\"" Giannini dropped 2 plates of food behind me splattering bits of food on my arm, clothes,etc. Cut to the GONE WRONG....Gino comes up and hands me his business card and tells me how hi is fanatical about his clothes and if any of my clothes need dry cleaning to contact him.  Great EXCEPT they then hand me the ENTIRE BILL.  In no way did I expect they would pick up the bill $26, but I did think they would take my breakfast off the bill.  Super angry that he can tell me about how fanatical about he is about his clothes while allowing me to walk out with water spots (where I tried to get the food off) all over my shirt and shorts.  The people watching were amazed that it was the manager who did it and then did nothing but hand me his card.  I won't be back as long as John Gino  Giannini is the manager."
0,"Crappy Cleaners. I was very disappointed with the way my clothes came back. The shirt with pleats looked like they put it in the dryer, had to take it to a different place to get it done right ."
0,"Called to place a carry out order and they said they couldn't take our order because they had \""a full house\"" and promptly hung up before we could ask anything else.\n\nHorrible customer service! Definitely won't be back here and won't be recommending them either."
1,Good place because its easy to find a table here. I order rice and curry dishes which are good. My girlfriend orders thai dishes and likes them. She is thai and likes the place because it reminds her of her mom's cooking. The dishes are average priced and sometimes the lunch rush is crazy.
1,"I've eaten at Sala Thai at least a half dozen times. Each time I very happy with the food. I recommend it to friends and family.\n\nA bad sign: \nThey have stopped accepting credit cards. We were told to go to the ATM at the corner gas station. This is a shame as this will most surely hurt their sales. Also, it makes me wonder if they are going out of business. \n\nI will continue to eat there as long as they are around."
1,"Best coffee of any Vietnamese restaurant.  So so so inexpensive!!!  Best sandwiches, best pho, best everything.  It's the quintessential hole in the wall.  Everything is a comforting about the food.  My ideal meal here is an order of spring rolls, barbecue pork sandwich, and hot coffee.  And when we go to pay I always pick up one of those chewy green coconut desserts.  My husband orders pho and I always drink the left over soup.  For about 10 bucks, you feast."
0,If I could give them no stars I would. Absolutely the WORST customer service ever. Jennifer finds herself leaving messages then doesn't allow you to speak about what it was she said. There are always added hidden fees from changing cars to even address changes. I was a long time client if theirs but not after today. If rather pay a little more than be treated as if they don't care about their clients. Certainly will be telling people never to use State Farm and if they still choose to I would make sure they used any other agent but this office. WORST EVER!!
0,So I've been here several times \n\nThey've given me unnecessary medications/antibiotics and never helped the root problem\n\nDue to the excessive medication they put me on I had to permanently stop breastfeeding my 7 month old baby simply because they pumped me full of medications for so long that my son refused to breastfeed after 2 months of not breastfeeding.\n\nThey only care about making money because I've gotten several bills in the mail for all of their services which they said were covered by my insurance. \n\nI've been in twice before 4 and they have refused to see me. They're sign says new patients arrive by 4 and established customers by 4:30\n\nThe front desk is always rude and unprofessional as well\n\nWill never be back and never referring friends or family anymore.
1,"I've ate here on numerous occasions for work events and tried the \nMayor Hafen's Macho Nacho which has worms, scorpions, and crickets in it.  Those nachos were something to experience!  When taking a bite out of the macho nacho I could feel the insects crushing and oozing in between my teeth.  I'm not sure if I gagged from the insects or from the layers of cheese mixed with it.  Try it if you're adventurous.  I got the t-shirt for eating it!\n\nWhile they do specialize in nachos, I've tried their other bar food such as the chicken wings which were of good size and flavor.  The quesadillas were delicious, but nothing special that I couldn't find somewhere else.\n\nWhen I went back for lunch last Thursday, I did try Mexi-chicken sandwich with their ranch seasoned fries on their lunch menu that was delicious.  The chicken was seasoned just right and juicy.  It was filling.\n\nOverall, I've been pleased with the service and enjoy trying new items on their menu."
0,$20 for a double Maker's Mark?  Me thinks not T.G.I. McPappadeaux.  I was not impressed by anything that was there and will not only steer clear but may avoid the I-17 all together.
0,"MGM....Grand...hmmm? Let's omit the adjective \""grand\"". \nIf you booked a promotional deal and did not receive it upon check-in, demand to speak to management either at the time or later on that evening to receive any promotional coupons promised. \nAll the food at the buffet tasted the same. yuck! \nOur view was of a wall and air conditioning units in the West Wing (4th floor). \nLazy river pool closes at 6pm. \nLimited amount of waitresses on the casino floors \n\nHappy times: Been here four other times and this was my first time writing a poor review. But perhaps it is because the economy is down. Let's stay classy Vegas. Again, not the worse place to stay, but come on, a wall for a view. Give me a break..."
1,"oh how i love the bellagio. i highly recommend staying in a baller room or suite. i think everything about this place is fabulous, the pool cafe, the fountains, the cheesy music channel in your room that plays the fountain tunes, and that chocolate business at jean-phillippe. \n\ni also won gambling, that was hot."
0,"the bartending staff is unhelpful and not friendly in the least bit. they refuse to offer the drink specials that were obviously listed in the fliers in the restroom, and they kicked my friend and I out when we objected. I refuse to spend money in this bar because of the awful service I have received in here multiple times."
1,Favorite place in the valley to get breakfast! \n\nLove the Eggs Benedict and Crab Stuffed Pastry!
0,"I was very disappointed and offended by our server on my visit to hash house. He not only seemed to know absolutely nothing about the menu, he served me a meal with garlic in it after I told him I was allergic!! He clearly had no regard for his job or for other people!! Unfortunately due to this experience I will not be going back"
1,I purchased a Gift certificate and took my son there for a Friday night dinner and play some pool. The staff greeted us as soon as we entered and was very nice. We were sat in the open pool bar area. The music was too loud but it is a bar. The food was great up until the Creme Brule was served. It was cold and the caramelized glaze was just burnt sugar. I gave them 4 stars because they are trying to make things better. Very nice staff and management. We will be back.
1,Great for breakfast meetings as the food is always good and the service is prompt. \n\nThis is my default for Tempe morning meetings.
0,"The entrance is deceiving! The rest of the building looks like crap!!! \n\nIf you're thinking about moving here: BEWARE. There's a lot of noise. They don't take care of the building, materials used in the units are cheap and it's like dogs gone wild throughout the \""garden areas\"" with poop and piss EVERYWHERE!\n\nIf you are in your early 20's or just out of college then this may be the perfect place for you! It's like an extended college dorm.\n\nHorrible place to live - especially for the money!"
0,"So absolutely disappointed in this place!\nHad being going for the past few years and at the advent and addition of the pub, the service, and ambiance has been completely lost.\n\nService has sucked the last few times, and getting a table despite calling ahead has not yielded results.\n\nAs of late, it seems they should hire a professional cleaner for their shelving units.\n\nCompletely argumentative owners and seriously burnt out staff!\n\nRude at times, and food is rushed.\nWe loved this place but will not be going back. You would think you would want to keep your regulars, but guess not"
1,"The Pink Spot is definitely my new spot for ice cream. I got an amazing brownie sundae there and it took me two days to eat it!  \n\nThey also offer frozen bananas, which makes me feel \nlike I'm at a Bluth Banana Stand (a la Arrested Development). \n\nAND! They deliver!"
1,"I've experienced Postino two different ways in the past two weeks: a late night visit for tea and sparkling wine and a few days later to grab pick up for my boss and myself. \n\nThe first visit was a nice intro, I like the location, tucked in on Campbell, and the interior design is cozy (fab chandelier!). The retail wine area at the entrance is awkward to me, because it's cramped and I frankly think you should all be buying wine at my shop so perhaps I'm a touch biased. Anyway, it is a great way for you to take home whatever you enjoyed with your dinner. Damn magnanimity. \n\nI wasn't in the mood for drunk biking that night so I skipped the adult beverages for a pot of tea. I get that this is a wine cafe so really no one going here is going to review a cup of tea, except for me. Tea selection was sad. Tea has the same cult following that wine does, so three options seemed half-hearted. And my pot of hot water was only half filled, which, for $2.50 is lame.  Okay I'm done bashing PW. \n\nThe second time I drove in for a take out order of the bruschetta board. My order was ready, the place was packed and I was able to get in and out in less than 3 mins! We ordered the date and pistachio on ricotta, the fig and prosciutto, the mozz/tomato/basil and the smoked salmon pesto. Great value to order ratio, each slice was huge and pre-chopped into littler bites. The smoked salmon was definitely my favorite, with the runner up being the pistachio/date combo. The MTB was a little dry for me and I don't eat prosciutto so that was for my boss.\n\nI love that they have neighborhood night deals and that you can friend them on facebook and get a special word of the day to get $5 glasses of wine no matter what time of night!"
1,"Only 229 reviews, so I'll add another one!  I found this on Yelp, and it was only 4 miles from my hotel downtown, so I had to try it.  Best tacos I've ever had!  I ordered a chicken flour taco, a beef corn taco, and a chicken lettuce taco, and was served complimentary chips, salsa, and guac, along with bottled costco water, and the check was $5.25!  I ordered different variations of Tacos all 4 times I went, so I can't comment on the rest of the menu, but both friends I brought with me during my later visits loved it as much as I did!\n\nIf you are in Vegas, don't skip this place!!"
0,We ordered this about a year ago shortly after they first opened. Overall the pizza was decent but seemed almost like an at home frozen throw it in the oven style and what really killed it was using CANNED MUSHROOMS! We will never go again due to our favorite topping coming out of a can...
1,"Five stars if my second visit is as good as the first.  I had a few minutes to kill in the afternoon, so just went in to have a look around because I've heard good things.  Even though there wasn't much left in the pastry counter, what was there was amazing.  AMAZING!  The pastries were all so beautiful they almost didn't look real.  Some of the chocolate even was finished with this metallic substance that made them look just like copper.  The girl behind the counter was so nice and patiently answered all the stupid questions falling from my drool covered face.  So of course I had to try a mousse, and may I say AMAZING!  Best mousse I've had in years.  There were obviously no shortcuts in ingredients or preparation.  Can't wait to go back and try more!"
1,"Stuffed! Had Ramen Tonkutsu with the most perfectly hard boiled egg, fried rice, gyoza.  Place seems to have the right balance in most of their dishes. Love they they have kimchee on the menu. Even so everything seems to be hard core japanese, kimchee and Ramen is just a brilliant combo. noodles perfectly cooled and paired. They use different noodle thickness for different soups as I discovered tonight."
0,"I must say, i'm quaking a bit writing this review as I see that the owner is very contentious towards any negative reviews on her salon but I feel I must write of my experience here.  I have to say that the employees here are technically very unskilled, at least the ones that I experienced.\n\nThe positives: As reviewers below have stated, the hygiene of this place is impeccable, I watch for that as I am quite a germaphobe in these places and they scrub the tubs so thoroughly after every job and their tools are sterilized and super clean. The receptionist, technicians, and owner were extremely sweet and offered tea, coffee and were very personable. However, i prefer rude and skilled to sweet and unskilled as I come to salons to come out looking and feeling better, not to chit chat. \n\nMy brows: She was extremely gentle and even though i usually get a bit of a rash after getting waxed, somehow her technique and the products she used left my skin feeling silky smooth. It was a decent job but my eyebrows are very shaped so it's really just about cleaning up. She took a tad bit off my arch than I usually do and it took a few weeks for me to regain my shape again :/ B\n\nNails: I'm looking at pics of other people who had their nails done here and it all looks great. I'm wondering what went wrong with me and i'm guessing she had hired new people since then. Now here it goes. I asked for an American French and for an express mani pedi as I was in a bit of a hurry. They took their SWEET TIME with that. If your customer expresses that she/he has time limits then I believe it's quite important to try to meet that limit. Even then, I do appreciate when technicians take time because they are being thorough but that was not the reason. They would put their tools down at long intervals to chit chat to us and each other and while one was doing my feet, the other finished with my friend but just sat there while my hands were not being worked on. I couldn't believe it. I've never seen such a lack of time efficiency. All in all a 30 minute express mani pedi took well over two hours. AINT NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT. Are you kidding me?? Well over two hours for this?? You would think after that I would have some fabulous looking hands and feet but the half circles they shaped for my american were crooked and uneven, I would normally say something but I was extremely pressed for time so I just left. Later at home, the shape bothered me so much that I took them off and redid them myself. Boom. Much better job and I saved myself money and a ton of time. \n\nI would say that this salon does have great potential and I really love the relaxing environment of the place but they do need better skilled, more efficient technicians."
1,Great decor and experience at the bouchon each time I've been here .... \n\nGreat for brunch which is why most people go here but also great for dinner \n\nCroque madame is amazing for brunch \n\nFor dinner.... \n- sea bass was good except the sauce was slight on the salter side \n-the chicken was super tender and the sauce complimented well\n-the lamb was pretty good and amazing ! Texture was just perfect \n-foie Gras in a jar was good it was tasty and paired well with the slight salt .... but I actually really liked it with jam it off setted some of the saltiness\n\nAwesome service !\nAaron Pana manager and our server Danny surprised our bride to be with a a box of macaroons .... she really wanted them so the manager walked over to the bakery and got some macaroons it was amazing with our coffee
0,"Apparently the handlebar is like an institution in Tempe.  It's known for its beer and laid back atmosphere.  They had plenty of televisions for sports watching and bench seating for larger groups.  The patio was a great addition, for smoking or possibly hanging out when the weather is nice.  We stopped in because another bar was fully packed and we saw another group was going into Handlebar and commenting on the display in the window.  There was so type of indecent doll doing something to a handlebar.  Sounds like the perfect place to me.  \nMy husband and I were waiting to go to dinner later so we only ordered drinks.  Our waiter was pretty attentive at first but the more people that came in that he knew the less we saw of him.  I ordered a Moscow mule that had whiskey but wasn't strong so I could have kept with the pitcher of water on the table.  My husband ordered some drink with beer and vodka, I believe but as you can see, it was so forgettable I can't even remember what it was.  Pretty much we had a pit stop to warm up and figure out our next course of action.  Walgreens would have been a better option."
1,"Kabuto is certainly the new sushi sheriff in town.  As far as local sushi joints go, nothing can match their quality, preparation, care and detail.  The look on my face after my first bite of toro rivaled Arnold Schwarzenegger's face in \""Total Recall\"" when his eyes were popping out.  Would've been a classic profile picture!\n\nI did the omakase and everything was great.  I plan on just getting the nigiri courses and then just ordering additional nigiri since that's all I want the next time.  Maybe an order of toro with a side of chu-toro.  \n\nMake your reservation on Tuesday or Friday since they get their fish shipments from Tokyo on those days."
0,Kind of disappointed. The concept is great to make healthy meals intended for a person going to the gym. I felt like it was overly staffed with girls who just stood around and talked to each other. I ordered a lean ground turkey burrito. \n\nIt was cold. Felt like the meat was something I could have got frozen at Costco. Taste was bland. \n\nI was excited to go my first time. Just wasn't overly fond of the lack in taste of food and girls who were there pointlessly. They were prolly intended to be eye candy but didn't work out at all. \n\nDoesn't help the cooks were out of shape either.\n\nI don't real judge too much. It's rare I feel this strong. But feel like it's a great concept but have some improvements it could use.
1,"Constellation is perfect! The shop is bright and welcoming. Simple, but not plain.\nNo-frills coffee menu (all the necessities), pies and small snacks. Amy is so knowledgeable about her products, not to mention a pleasure to sit and chat with. Pick up a bag of Ceremony beans while you're at it. \n\nBy far my favorite coffee shop in Pittsburgh. 10/10, highly recommend."
0,"Wow, I can't believe this place getting 4 stars. BAM to POOF to me.\nFirst off the bread ... if you do not know now to make a simple bread ... how hard it is ... even my homemade bread taste better than that hard piece of rock they served. \nMaybe it was just a bad day for me. But it cannot be that bad right. nooo ... but sorry to say ... it is a yes for me.\nWaiter ... service ... zero! rude and didn't ask if we are done and took everything away ... but the food was bad anyways take it away as fast as you can.\nJumbo shrimp and petite fiilet mignon ... non fresh shrimp made for bad combo plus ... I ordered medium rare and it came out well done. hmm ... either the waiter doesn't know how to write his order or the head chef or whoever is cooking is just as bad as emeril lagasse himself. \nThen to coffee ... argh ... disgusting ... and we were like complaining and the waiter came by and asked ... we can brew a fresh one for you??? ... i was like WTF ... this was not a fresh brew to began with ... argh disgusting and chills all over my body ... so time to get out pronto!!!\n\nThe only good thing that came out of this is the wine we ordered ... they have an extensive selection and kudos for that ... \n\nBut I am never going back ... $55 for the entree ... I rather go to McD and I know what I am getting for $5.50.\n\nThank you Dad who said that my cooking with a costco steak is better than whatever they whipped up at demonic ... haa haa."
0,"This place gets 1 star for the food and 3 stars for the desserts.\n\nI would have thought that the creators of this buffet would take a lesson from places like Bellagio and Wynn, but they obviously were sleeping during class.  The crab legs were sooooo salty and gummy.  The fish dishes were overcooked.  The indian curries were bland.  I did like the prime rib, but don't forget to put the au jus!\n\nThe upside is that I think they spent all the time and effort on the dessert section.  The dessert offerings were plated individually and they were beautiful!  They also tasted good.  My favorites were the Nutella cake and the caramel flan.  Ice cream, cookies, biscotti, and brownies were also offered.\n\nOur server was very attentive and nice.  I cannot say the same for the people manning the different food areas.  No one could tell me what veggie was in the chicken curry (I figured out it was spinach).  \n\nWe went for lunch, and it was $20 per person.  I wouldn't come back here unless they revamped their offerings."
0,"I have purchased alot from Best Buy thru the years, but will not do so anymore.  I stood in line for the Geek Squad for 25 minutes.  They had 1 person working the area, and he was working hard.  No complaints with Mark.  After 25-30 mins another Geek squad memeber came out of the back to help me.  I explained what i needed and he went to the back for a few minutes.  He came out and left the area and told me Paul would be right out to help me.  O, so I wait for Paul for another 5-8 minutes and just finally left the store without being helped.  Approx 40 minutes in line to get my computer looked at it and received zero help!"
1,"I'm giving this place 4 stars for the taste of the food only (not the staff/operations etc.) because the food is really really really good.  And I only had the pizza so I can only imagine what the pasta tastes like, I'm looking forward to going back and finding out!  But a friend that I was with had their pasta and said it was one of the best meals she's had in really long time.  \n\nOk now a separate rating of 0-1 STAR for poor restaurant management.  This place is really popular so expect a wait.  We went on a Saturday night - we must have been masochists b/c we had to wait for an 1 1/2 hours.  But hey I get it and I'm not complaining about the actual wait time.  I will complain about the inability for the restaurant staffers to move/turn tables quicker.  There were so many (not just one or two) but several tables that were done eating but were not budging from their seats.  Dozens of people were waiting to be seated.  And I get the whole lets just sit a bit after our meal, but sitting for longer than 15 minutes when there's a huge wait for other patrons is totally unacceptable and rude.  I feel that it's the restaurants responsibility to politely approach a table that's done with their meal but just lounging around to encourage them to leave.  It's also in the best interest of the restaurant if they're in the business to make money.  Faster tables turned = more groups seated = more $$$$.\n\nJust a friendly, \""Is there anything else you'll need tonight and thanks for coming\"", would probably be sufficient to subtly suggest, \""Get the hell out of here\"".  But no, the staffers refused to do anything about it, and they were also getting annoyed about the groups that had been sitting for 45 minutes or longer after eating.  But I'm not sure why they refuse to do anything about it.  I feel like if they were to fix this issue, this restaurant would be one of the best in the city.  It's just poor operational managment!\n\nOnce we were seated our waitress was very attentive and friendly so I'm not criticizing the service, but the operations of the place."
1,"So this big guy- that looks like Elvis- sits in a chair and sings you some Elvis tunes.  What else could you want??\n\nLocated in Bill's Gambling Hall, look for the tiny stage near the bar. If you see a crowd where the average age is 60 then you've found the right place.  Performance days and times can be found on his website.\n\nJust a heads up - he is apparently crazy popular.  We got in 20 minutes before his 3 p.m. Friday show and we couldn't find a table to sit at.  I would definitely recommend getting in early to get a table because we wound up not being able to see anything sitting at the bar.\n\nReally nice guy with a great voice, plus he wears a shiny Elvis costume!"
0,"I don't expect much from diners, but GEEZ give me a break!  We went on a Saturday morning and yes it was busy but ALL 3 meals were COLD as ice and my husbands eggs weren't over easy, they were over raw.  I expect over easy eggs to be runny and maybe some white portions not perfect but they were clear!  I almost lost it while watching him try to eat around it.  My daughter's pancakes were cold, my french toast was cold and none of it could even melt the butter a little bit.  When they ask if everything's ok they are literally walking past and you just know if you asked to heat it up who knows when you might get it back and how it would be then.  It was a big disappointment because really, how hard is it to get warm french toast and pancakes at an IHOP?  So so sad..."
1,"We did not stay at this hotel but definitely spend a lot of time there.\nThe gambling was fun, the clubs (Coyote Ugly and Rok) were great. \nThe New York Pretzel shop was delicious and open late-so we could grab something there even late into the night.\nOver all the hotel was great and very pleasant. \nNext time we visit Vegas I will definitely stay at New York New York!!!"
0,"Menu was incorrect, they didn't have some of the items advertised on there in store menu anymore. Food was definitely sub par. My tortilla soup was edible but it didn't taste like tortilla soup. The chicken meat in my taco had no flavor. My husband said his Baka taco was good. And my sister in laws quesadilla tasted like a quesadilla. On an up note, the salsa bar salsas were pretty good."
0,"I've been to this location 4 times and will never go back. I've been to the east side location on Monona Dr twice, and absolutely LOVE it! Clearly different owners and standards of service. \n\n1) West side has a male employee who is completely rude. He doesn't make eye contact, he's annoyed when he gets customers (I have been there twice with my friend, twice alone), he's in a huge hurry. Once another employee came in and even they didn't speak to each other. He's just rude. \n\n2) Lots of ingredients are an extra charge. All you might hear is, \""that's a dollar fifty extra, that's fifty cents extra.\"" Not much friendliness happening over there. East side makes it totally pleasant! I'm not sure how, but part of it is just being super friendly and they seem so happy to see you!\n\n3) East side is so busy they have four people behind the counter. They welcome your arrival, smile, are engaged and always have customers. They wear cool uniforms, and everyone says, \""thank you!\"" As a group when they hear you leave a tip. \n\n4)West side uses teaspoons to serve extras, east side uses a spoon larger than a Tablespoon. So for example, I might get 6 cranberries on my Strawberry salad cause of the size of the spoon. East side? 15 cranberries. When I said something to the west side guy, he scoffed and said it would be an extra charge and east side isn't the same place. Pecans? West side a few crumbs, east side? At least 8 nice sized pecans. \n\nI've talked to three people so far who have the same to say about this guy and location. We all understand why the place is always empty. Who wants to be an unwelcome customer paying over 10 bucks for a salad? I would rather go to the Copps salad bar and get my own for less than $7 bucks. Thank goodness, I live on the west side but WORk on the east side, so if I want Salad Creations, I can go to Monona Drive and pay $10 for a salad, and I feel really good about being in there! So much positive energy!"
0,"This place was, eh, okay...but I probably won't go back.  The service was painfully slow and the food was simply average.  It wasn't bad, per se, but there are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas, that this one really isn't worth a second shot."
0,Horrible service! Was at pool with bad servers that took for ever to get food and drinks they were not very friendly but thebar tender was cool. Bad service at the tables. Just tried getting water and it took over an hour. Tried getting food at Black Fig and sat in line behind about 4 people for it to take 30 minutes to get to cash register then took about 40 minutes to get food. I had two orders of food and after I got it the hot wings were cold. Employees are slow and just stand around in most of the areas. Not a fan of this place and I won't be back.
0,"Went in for a manicure, paid 14 dollars and left with nails not painted. Basically all he did was file and trim cuticles.  I think the polished I picked was old and when it bubbled some lady there said it was my nails that made to polish bubble up! He took color off, tried again...same thing. I asked for clear and he didnt even get all the color polish off....I will never go back...the lady was so rude to me."
0,"Don't get alterations done once you purchase the suit! We purchased 12 suits for our bridal party and when my fianc\u00e9 went to pick his up from getting the pants hemmed, he found that they had simply folded almost 6 inches of fabric up underneath the pant leg which made them bulky and heavy. When he complained they agreed that it was not done properly and he waited while they fixed it, only to find that there were now large holes in the fabric that you could see from a distance. We had to get another pair of pants and definitely took them somewhere else for alterations. Also, when we picked up the suit it wasn't pressed at all, it simply looked like it had been lying in the corner on the floor. \n\nTerrible service, attitude and quality...I now see why they have to offer SO many sales for their stores."
1,"Dear Bluephies,\n\nIt's on again! Brunch that is.....\n\nI have an on again, off again relationship with this place, and I have come to the realization that I can only love you in the summer.... Ok, you ARE my summer fling! From your gorgeous mounds of fresh advocado, your perky little tomato chunks, and sensual mushrooms tenderyly mashed up in that advocado EggSTRAVAGANZA!  And then there's your beignets - plump little funnel cakes of heaven (I don't even have to wait for the fairs!). AND THEN you actually have a voluptuous portion of breakfast potatoes with a savory cajun spice (here spice reads - decently salted, not hot). \n\nBut, by far, the best reason you should come for Brunch is the BLOOD MARY's. They pride themselves (for good reason) as being a Vodkatorium. Which means they got great bloody's! Bloody Maria, Fat Boy, plain - they all have a nice consistancy (not too much alcohol to be runny, and not overdone with the mix to be too thick), outlandish garnish (a Scottish EGG!?, bacon, tater tots?!), and they do \""flights\"" of 3 bloody's! Impressive and yummy I take a point off of them (in relation to other bloody's in town) b/c they do use a premix (Zing -Zangs?). However, they compensate by adding good flavored vodkas (they have BACON vodka people!) \n\nBonus: they also have gluten free options, are pretty helpful with allergy \""stuff\"", and the dinners aren't bad either (my favorite is Trout with Pearl Cous cous - YUM, the chick salad croissant is just average, even though it sounds grand, and everyone likes the burgers.)"
1,"he's technically closed for the season, but after a phone call, he will let you peruse on appointment. \n\ni am absolutely flabbergasted by Shamus' skills. he literally grows tropicals...and they thrive!!! without much water, without a ton of humidity...who knew? i only assumed that none of his plants would live a month in AZ. i've eaten nearly everyone of the tropical fruits he grows....but only in places like laos, thailand, guyana, chile....basically anywhere but here! and i just still can't get over how he grows them with ease!\n\nhe does have a day job, so this is not like a nursery per se. it's his house and yard, so it's best to follow him on facebook for updates and times. he doesn't sell lantana or prickly pear or really anything desert related (or anything under 20 bucks, but you also pay for the expertise). what you will find are...pineapple, mango, passion fruit, guava, breadfruit, dragon fruit, lychee, banana, suriname cherry, and any other kind of tropicals. \n\nShamus gave me excellent planting, growing, and caretaking tips to ensure the mango tree i bought today would actually live. he also advised me on some of the other tropicals i have (pineapple, and plumeria) that don't really seem to do anything. i'm re-invigorated to start up the tropicals with better success this time. \n\ncash only and call him first...like i said, it's his home, not a retail nursery."
1,Omg wonderful service and food! The vegetarian paella is the best I have ever had! Great venue for vegetarians and non vegetarians. Loved the drink menu as well. THe service is really good and I love the bell and yelling of paella every time they cook a big batch of paella. So festive. The decor is nice also. From the outside it doesn't look like much but the inside once you sit down is cute and modern. definitely will go back!
0,"Went with Century Link after being frustrated with Cox,  and it's not much better at all.  Actually, its about 10x worse in terms of reliability.  Customer service always tries though, but it's pointless now.  Garbage equipment, and I've wanted to write this review for a week but my crappy internet service prevented me from doing so.   Will attempt Direct TV for cable, not sure what to do about internet."
1,My absolute favorite restaurant in the area.   Great menu that rotates on occasion.   The food is seriously great!
1,"So I decided to brave Lotus of Siam again, and admit that it's winning me over.\n\nThe crispy garlic prawns were a step down though; not very garlicky at all and I think the batter wasn't fully cooked.\n\nYou can totally eat the shells, but I'd still stay away from the tails, which have a tendency to poke you in your mouth. Ouch!\n\nThe nam prik ong was pretty fucking awesome. No wonder why it was featured on \""The Best Thing I Ever Ate.\"" The cool veggies (carrots, cauliflower, cucumber, string beans) offset the heat of in the spicy pork dip (my medium was plenty spicy).\n\nBut nothing is better than dipping pork rinds in pork. I mean, it's all the same animal, so it's meant to be.\n\nMy Thai friend Amy ordered an incredible crispy duck dish during our previous visit, and I was trying my damndest to remember the name. Oh well, next time.\n\nThe parking lot still sketches me out though. There were a few ambulances there when I went ... God knows what ... or who ... went down at the neighboring brothel and bathhouse."
0,"Whoever rated this more than 1 star must be related to this so called  mom & pop cafe.  Well if nothing else they are consistent with their most unfriendly owner (Gary) it takes everything he has to walk you to the table - never smiles or greets anyone and after he gets your money both times we were there \""never saying thank you in any way shape or form\"".\n\nThe breakfast is pretty good (hash browns pretty greasy) but who can mess up eggs or toast???  It brings old and cozy to a new level - you might just say OLD and grundgy !  \n\nPutting all this aside if your looking for mediocre food, atmosphere and a miserable\nowner to greet you I guess you came to the right place.  The food is not mom & pop\nprices more like resort rates, and the little unkept, unclean restrooms are much to be desired.\n\nI could go on and on about why I won't go back there, so don't say I didn't warn you\nbefore you try it !"

0,"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I've never been so frustrated in my life. I am no bridezilla. All I wanted was my bridesmaids dresses to match. One of the dresses we chose was from a different designer so we were concerned, but the ladies at the shop ASSURED me that they would match based off some swatches they showed us. I ordered 8 dresses in different styles. (Spending well over $1000 mind you) 7 came in beautifully. The one from the different designer did not match at all. Ok. No worries, We have time... I'll just pay the rush charges to order a different dress. I work in customer service. I know that when the customer is not happy there are SIMPLE solutions to rectify the situation. My simple solution would have been to order a new dress. The one that was a mistake can EASILY be sold off the rack. However, this store does not believe in customer service. They have a \""tough luck\"" policy that they FAILED to mention at the time of purchase. The \""manager\"" Shelley is completely condescending and has absolutely no compassion for a bride in distress. She wants us to pay $160 for a dress that we cant use AND THEN pay another $180 to rush order a new one that actually matches. At any point in time while I was ordering these dresses, if one of the employees made it a point that matching would have been an issue I would have simply made my bridesmaid choose the same designer. On the contrary we were promised there would be no issue. Well there is a huge issue. This company, its manager, and their policies. Do not expect ANY competence, care, or customer service from this business."

Took it back 5 days later because one of the buttons didn't work, and they refuse to take it back claiming i dropped and damaged it.

0,"I needed my radiator replaced ASAP and, as someone relatively new to Las Vegas, I relied on Yelp to choose an honest, competent mechanic. The owner of Liberty Tech may be friendly, but he and/or his team of mechanics are not reasonably priced or competent. \n\n(1) Competence: \nPrior to getting my radiator replaced, my transmission shifted perfectly. On my way home from Liberty Tech (directly after the radiator was replaced), however, my transmission was kicking roughly and shifting improperly. Not surprisingly, when I told the owner about the transmission issues stemming from the radiator replacement, he became defensive. He acted like the transmission issues were just a coincidence as it's not surprising for 7 year old cars to have transmission problems. He disagreed with me that it had something to do with the radiator replacement but said he'd take a look at it. \n\nI felt like I was just another girl getting hustled by a mechanic so I took my car to somewhere else for a disinterested opinion that I could trust. Sure enough, the disinterested mechanic said that transmission fluids drained during the process of replacing the radiator and should have been checked and replaced. He said that this is not uncommon, and was shocked that another shop failed to check and replace the transmission fluids (as this is a standard practice among competent mechanics). Low transmission fluids are extremely rough on transmissions and I'm lucky I promptly hired a competent mechanic to discover the problem before I drove more on low transmission fluids and damaged parts. \n\n(2) Price:\nThe full cost of changing the radiator was approximately $200 more than the average cost for my make/model/year. I accepted the price because it wasn't worth the hassle to transport my car to another shop and I assumed I was paying more for a higher quality shop. \n\nSUMMARY: \nPros: \n-nice. \n\nCons: \n-overpriced. \n-incompetent in replacing radiators. Responsible mechanics check, and where needed, replace transmission fluids after replacing radiators as transmission fluid is often lost in radiator replacements. \n-uncomfortable waiting room. The A/C felt like it was turned off or broken in the waiting area."

0,We had a group of 13 of us today for a birthday/football get together .. Let me tell you that this place SUCKS \nWe never even made it thru the door and this goon of a door man was looking at us \nGeez dude it's Sunday football and it's Scottsdale\nWe were dressed appropriately . Bottom line is\nThis place SUCKS way better places in Scottsdale\nThen this doucher don't waste your money here
0,we had a great server but we came with a whole soccer team and apparently the other server helping them can't do her job and the manager didn't seem too concerned with the poor service.
0,"Ate here on a Monday at lunch...the business was steady, not too busy. The decor is way outdated. The carpet is supposed to be red but is black because it's so old. The portion sizes are good but all of the food lacked seasoning.  I order the country version of eggs Benedict, which consists of a biscuit, sausage, poached egg and gravy with a side of country potatoes. I was so disappointed that the white gravy looked and tasted like it came from an instant mix...definitely not a good quality sausage gravy...it had no flavor. The country potatoes where crispy but again lacked any seasoning. Bottoms line...will never go back"
0,I was having a problem with my shoulder and someone suggested going to Arrowhead. He performed an ultrasound and told me I had a torn rotator cuff and a torn bicep tendon. They sent me to an ultrasound meanwhile it has been 6 weeks and they have not taken any action not even to call me about my MRI. I had to go to another position get another MRI and he diagnosed me with something completely different my suggestion is find a different place to go I could not even schedule an appointment before two weeks the doctor is two weeks out that's not very good when your shoulder hurts
0,Even though I haven't seen any rave reviews about this place my boyfriend and I decided to stop by for drinks on Monday night. Opened the door and the place was empty except for a couple sitting on the other end of the restaurant just lounging. We stood around for a bit and there was no hostess even though there was a hostess stand. We didn't know what to do so we eventually walked to the back which is where the bar was located. Someone eventually came out from the back and in a snotty manner said they closed at 6 so we left. We were here before 6 but there was no one to help us and their bright neon OPEN sign was on. Annoying. We drove by later and the sign was still on. Not coming back here.
0,"I was there the second night of business.  Servers everywhere yet piss poor service.  I was one of maybe five customers.  I ordered the steak, forty minutes later it arrived, cold,  I sent it back, only to receive my same steak and veggies microwaved to the point of no return.  Like all of you, I'm a local so I gave it a second chance.  One server and still very slow cold food.  Initially I ordered the stew and was told none was made that day.  Horrible, horrible, horrible place pretending  to be a restaurant.  Don't waste your time or money.  Who ever wrote the first, glowing review on Yelp must be the owner or sensory deprived."
1,Outstanding place to eat.  Very affordable and far better than Subway.  Quiet and relaxed atmosphere.
1,"I don't think of hibachi places as big draws, especially for the foodie crowd. So, I was surprised to walk into Ohjah on a Friday night and see the place packed. It's also a sushi joint, but that side of the restaurant had a few open tables. The hibachi side was filled. That's impressive considering they had six cooking stations.\n\nThe basic hibachi dinner ($8.95) consists of standard fare -- vegetables, salad, soup, and fried or steamed rice or noodles. I added shrimp ($5.75) and a 5 oz. filet ($7.55) to the mix. The shrimp was pretty good and the filet was cooked medium rare, as ordered, and was tender, as expected.\n\nThe best way to judge any hibachi place, though, is the entertainment factor. Our chef -- an older guy -- was ok. He was friendly enough, but all the tricks he did were the same standard ones you see at any hibachi place -- tossing the egg shell in the hat, the onion volcano, etc. He also tossed shrimp to some of the guests (again, a standard hibachi trick) but only to the guys, which disappointed some of the women at the table.\n\nIf you like hibachi places, you'll like this. If you don't, you probably won't be a fan. While it's similar to many others I've been to, I'd recommend this place for a fun night out whether or not it's with a date or a family."
0,This club could have some potential but it's always empty. I've been here 4x since grand opening a few weeks ago and it's slower and slower every time.  Staff is polite once inside. It literally takes 20-25 minutes in heavy weekend traffic to get from Bellagio to the SLS. They might as well be on their own island.
0,"I came here with my daughter on May 7th 2014 and then again on May 21st 2014. On the 21st, I was waiting for my daughter to be finished with her nail drying and as I was waiting, I noticed their inspection review posted on the wall. I began reading it and every technician was red flagged. Every single one. The inspector had so much to write about he/she wrote all the faults and flags in between preprinted words, around the outsides of the page, and on the back. For each tech under the comment field, he/she had to write so small about all their short-comings that it was very difficult to read. From what I gathered, it was mostly how each tech wasnt cleaning their tools properly, unsanitary, bacteria found.  The date for the inspection was May 8th 2014. The one line that stuck with me was \""not a single bottle of disinfectant/tsa or liners throughout the entire salon nor at any nail stations\"". When I was finished reading, I turned around and found that management the receptionist and a few other techs were watching me. I asked when their next inspection will be, and they said \""no need, we passed\"". I said, \""according to this, clearly not\"". I got a shrug of the shoulder and a back to my face. When I paid, I didnt offer a tip, and the receptionist asked me if I was going too, I informed her that I shouldnt be paying for anything,  but because I didnt come in here to get something for free nor an infection or worse HEP C, I certainly wont be giving a tip. Needless to say, I wont be going back. IMHO."
0,Overall experience is VERY bad.  Use at your own risk!
0,Never again
0,"Okay, I love Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-In's and Dives but this restaurant was quite disappointing.  This was definitely a dive and I don't care about that but an italian restaurant that uses canned mushrooms???????????  Thank God I didn't get the vegie \""boli\"" and my sister in law did because I couldn't have handled any canned vegies.  Our original \""boli\"" was okay; it didn't have a lot of meat but a lot of bread.  Not at all like E. Coast \""boli's\"".  My niece (2 y.o.) got \""fried\"" mac-n-cheese that was just Kraft Mac-N-Cheese fried.  Would I go back??  I don't think so!.  Sorry Guy."
0,"I used to like this place. I guess they are under new management and now they suck. Food has changed, and so has the customer service. The chubby young fellow that served us messed up by ordering the wrong thing then says that he'll give us the bowl for free. Then when I was rang up I asked of him to split the bill and he responded with a yes. Then when I went to sign the bill he ran the whole thing on my card. I brushed it off then realized that he charged us for the bowl he said he would give for free. This sneaky kid! The nerves of this kid. Unbelievable! Had I not held my breath and my friend for stepping in to get the issue solved I probably would have caused a scene. I doubt I will ever return. New owners changed everything..beyond irritated at this restaurant because of that very server"
1,"Just like Sonic I miss this place so much. I have not found a place that can come even close in Boston to the unreal Mexican food \""Betos\"" had 24/7. Nothing beat hitting up Betos after a night of drinking or even hitting it up at 7am for a breakfast burrito. You cannot beat their prices, the breakfast burritos are less than 2 bucks and their bigger and as heavy as a brick. Betos will you and Sonic please move franchises to Boston."
1,I went on a vacation to Arizona from Chicago and was told king gyros had great food. The food wasn't great it was beyond fantastic i don't know where to start. I kept on ordering out when I was there for 2 weeks and this is the only restaurant I would ever fly out for it I became a millionaire. Great family owned business and fantastic food.
0,"I use to go here once or twice a month, not bad. At first it was promising. My dad recommended them for me because he liked them. As I continued to go it just felt as of I was wasting their time. I would come in, wait and a barber would get done with a hair cut, clean up and go to the back for awhile(A good 5-10 minutes). Than come back & with this FML attitude, say they were ready.  Just made me feel like I ruined their day. But everyone has bad days, so I gave them a chance and continued to go. Even recommended them to my grandfather. He tells me the next week that they butchered him. But I just figured he was a grouchy old man. About a week later my father tells me he went to get a hair cut.  He said he was waiting with 2 other men. There was 2 barbers working at the time. They got done with 2 haircuts and went to the back. My father told me he waited with the other customers for 45 minutes, just him and the 2 others waiting, before he and the 2 other men decided to leave.  After hearing that, I was done. That's just horrible customer service. That being the last straw, I will not go back."
1,Excellent fish and chips. Yummy. You are not to have hard liquor at the bar due to a weird liquor license. The gaming machines are alright. It has an old feel to it because of all the wood. I like this place because of the fish and chips not much more. Other than that ...its just the same old pub.
1,The Carne Asada tacos are awesome ! I plan to be back to check out more menu items. I love the fact the Hobe meats counter is located inside the restaurant . I will need to pick up some to go items the next time I have time to cook .
1,"Wowee!  I finally got to eat here after hearing all about the red velvet pancakes.  I waited until a day that I had a good, long workout in before venturing over and imbibing what I assumed would be massive amounts of carbs.  Today was that day:  I ran 10 long miles (triathlon training) beforehand and then met a friend at 8:30am for the sugar-fest.  There was a short wait for our table since this is a cozy, little joint, but we were seated in 5 minutes instead of the 15 that was initially mentioned.  Service was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal.  Afraid that the red velvet pancakes would be just too sweet for a whole breakfast, I ordered the corned beef hash, eggs over medium, and hash browns with the pancakes on the side.  Yes, this girl can eat!  The nice surprise is that the pancakes were not as sweet as expected.  Yes, they come topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips, but the cream cheese syrup is on the side and one can control how much sweetness with that stuff.  I LOVED them!  My friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were also delish.  I want to go back tomorrow and try some of the other tempting items on the menu--it may be a blessing or a curse that Babycakes is right down the street from my house!"
1,These guys are honest and very nice. Had them do my total engine in my Saleen and they did it right. Honest and I refer everyone to them to everyone.
0,This is chain restaurant quality. Not very good Mexican food at all. And is very expensive for what you get.
0,"I'm not exactly a food connoisseur. If I eat out, it's usually fast food. I don't expect too much from low priced eateries.\n\nThat said, I'm sorry to say that this is seriously the worst buffet I have ever eaten at. The food was seriously bad. The sushi(not that I expect too much from a Chinese buffet when it comes to sushi, again) was dry, warm, and just bland. \n\nThe Chinese dishes were unremarkable, except for the \""honey chicken,\"" which I swear to Ba'al had sauce that was nothing but tomato soup and corn starch. That was remarkable, but not in a good way. Selection was limited, it was also the smallest buffet I'd ever seen. I had serious concerns as to the sanitation, though happily I didn't get sick afterwards.\n\nAtmosphere was dark and depressing. It was exactly as you'd picture a deserted, run down restaurant in a run down strip mall would be like. I got depressed just being there, and embarrassed for having chosen this spot for my wife and I to spend our rare child free time out.\n\nI wish no ill will on the owners, but I don't think I'll ever return. It's just terrible. Hopefully they can turn it around, and by that I mean completely turn it around into like an entirely different restaurant."
1,"Searching desperately for a Mexican restaurant that stayed open a little later than 9pm on the night of my friend's dad's birthday, we settled on Bonito Michoacan.\n\nWhat we received was extremely friendly service, a lot of delicious food, and they had like a 4 piece band sing happy birthday and gave our man of the hour a free shot of tequila.\n\nI don't really see anything I could have criticized from our experience. We were seated promptly, treated well, and the food was surprisingly very delicious. Additionally, we stayed there for a good 40 minutes after their closing time and never felt rushed at all.\n\nI had the steak cilantro, whilst the others around the table had an assortment of chimichanga, a crazy gigantic burrito, and chicken helena or something along those lines. Everything was cooked really well with rich strong flavors.\n\nWe also got the hand-made table side guacamole and it was extremely tasty and fresh.\n\nAll in all it was a very pleasant experience."
0,"Eh, in place of Debbie Gate's All-not so good grill.  New owner has painted the place, cleaned it up some, it is better but not a great interior due to how it was designed and age.  Some of the lights hanging as if on a construction sight.  Lights behind the counter are just to glaring when hanging out.  Really need to fix or cover.  \nThe staff/waitress's are the same as the prior restaurant.  Nice and friendly and do an OK job.  Menu has many types of burgers, sandwiches, salad, chicken waffles and breakfast items.  Every Thursday the menu includes Ribs.  Ribs were pretty standard ribs that are about as good as any in the area, had a little sauce that was sweet with a little spicy flavor.  Had a side salad of linguine with cheese, pepperoni, olives and a dressing.  Salad was OK, a little to cold at first."
0,"How is this the best fish and chips in town? It was like a government meal with dehydrated peas. My coke was flat. And an old man sat right next to me and lit up a cigarette....that didn't help any. The bartender was sweet, that's about it."
0,"We had a family emergency in phoenix. I have always used Holiday Inn for my travel lodging since I travel for business so much. I am one of their preferred platinum members and over the course of the past year I have accumulated a lot of reward points. I figured that I would use my reward for one night free while staying in phoenix this time to off set some additional expenses we might have. \nI arrived late that night to check in, I am told that the only suite left is on the second floor so I take this. I was told that my room was around the back ( second bldg closest the the  free way. I pull around into the parking which was packed, parked rather far from the door and began my search for my room ( no maps avail or offered) I look at the building and it is shaped like the letter U. Hmmm. Second bldg closest the the free way would mean in the middle. After searching for a bit I concluded that I was given the wrong directions. It was in fact the last bldg (next to the hwy ) and the room was on the interior wall of that bldg. Ok so now I am a bit annoyed. I go back out for the rest of my luggage and receive a phone call while getting my things out of the car. The phone call was from a family member reporting on the emergency we were having. While I am on the phone two security people decide it wise to approach my vehicle and insist that I roll down the window and tell them if I am a hotel guest and if so which room am I in. ( I guess the lugage in the back wasn't a clue enough nor the fact that I was upset with a phone to my ear. After concluding the call I take the rest of my luggage in. I might add that the entrence to my room involved an exterior entrance gate ( with broken handle) going down an external hall, waiting for the smallest elevator on earth to come down and finally arriving at my room. \n\nThe interior of the room was \""OLD\"" but clean. The doors were in ill repair and in need of replacement. The interior is not up to date which the standard Holiday Inn's that I have stayed at the past year. The only exception to this the bed which Is very comfortable. Drapes, furniture and room decor need updating to new Holiday Inn specs.\n\nThe second day of our stay we returned to be locked out of our room. On check in I had used a reward for one night and paid for the second. OOPS someone forgot to tell me that I would have to \""re check in\""??? This was really handy with my husband arriving the next day waiting in front of the external gate, hands full of luggage trying to get in. We had to repack the car with his luggage and return to check in. WHen I asked \"" why wasn't I told this\"" the young man that checked me in the night before proceeded to argue that he had. I advised him this was not the case or I would have done this before I had left that morning. He still insisted he was right and I was wrong. Annoyed i proceeded to Re Check in. The lady which heard the entire conversation then proceeded to ask me again for ID and credit card even though the young man said he checked me in the night before, even though he told her that he knew who I was and what room I was in, even though I had two room keys and confirmed the room that they belonged to and even though my credit card was on file. \n\nSecond morning, my husband gets up wondering where the paper is. As premier members we are supposed to receive a paper in the AM. He goes to the front desk to inquire. AT 7 AM in the morning on a Sunday he was told that they didn't have any and that he could run down to circle K to get one. \n\nTHE WORST HOLIDAY INN EXPERIENCE EVER. THANK YOU FOR MAKING OUR FAMILY EMERGENCY THAT MUCH MORE STRESSFUL."
0,"Pizza was so so. Charging 75 cents for drink refills after spending $25 is a bit ridiculous.  Surely there are better pizza places in Scottsdale, unfortunately, we missed them.  Save yourself on this one - keep looking for better."
1,"Despite is ridiculous name, it is a great club.\nReally good mash up music-Ciara meets Grandmaster Flash meets Madonna's Hung Up meets Britney meets Rick Springfield's \""Jesse's Girl\"" then Eurythmics in 5 minutes or less, well done DJ Vice, well done.\nDecent drinks.\nThis place gives hetero clubs a good name though my sister & I agreed there wasn't a good looking guy in the place. So give another star if your hooking up depends on alcohol and good lighting."
0,"HACKS! Be careful if you have a food allergy and you eat here!!!! I had one of their Grandma Blacks cookies which was loaded with walnuts, which I am allergic to. After eating the cookie I went into anaphylactic shock and was hospitalized for three days. There was NO mention anywhere in this restaurant on Baseline road of walnuts being used in any of their products. Not on the menus, not on the website, not on the damn wrapper for the cookie.\nWhen I approached the owner Terry Black about getting partial compensation for the thousands of dollars of hospital bills, I was met with little sympathy. Not even an apology. I can understand the owner not wanting to fork out the dough, and I even understand that there is no hard law in AZ that states you have to list allergens on your food products. But in this age of information, business ethics and customer service is everything and unfortunately this establishment LACKS just that. Years later and they still don't have any sort of allergy warnings on their menus or website. The day after my incident, the counter girl put a hand written note on the cookie jar that said 'may contain nuts'. That note was on for a day, tops! I am no longer a customer. These guys are poor excuses for restauranteurs. Stay away! Your life may depend on it if you have a food allergy."
1,The food is excellent and the delivery service is outstanding.  They handle everything with a smile. We've eaten our way through the menu and haven't found anything that wasn't good.
0,"We are from out of town and our friends raved about the pizza here...we were quite disappointed. For starters, we understand waiting a while to get seated on a busy night, bur several of the female waitresses seemed to have friends who they sat ahead of us an many other guests who had been waiting a long time. Our order was taken quickly, but the food took forever to arrive! And the food was just ok, nothing exciting. Also, my wife ordered a water along with her margarita, and never got it until we flagged down our waitress to remind her. The waitress didn't follow up with us after delivering the food. We also finished off with the ice cream cookie and that was super mushy."
1,"Very nice ambience, especially in the fall. \nLarge, mature trees line long fields with a pretty view of the south mountains. A quaint \""farm\"" setting with small gardens and little shops in shabby chic buildings. \n\nYou park across the street in a dirt/rock lot. Once you wander across the street, there is a cute little shack type set up, you walk in, grab your fresh made, plastic packed items. They have fresh and hearty salads with your choice of gourmet dressings, choices of sandwiches on artisan breads, delicious muffins and cake slices, all made right there. There are really cute miniature pies that look great, as well as fresh made lemonades that are really good. \n\nYou get your sandwiches (fresh made) in a little picnic basket, after you pay. Grab a seat in the fenced in garden and enjoy the views and the weather (if it's not too hot out). Many people bring their pups and enjoy a walk around the farm.\n\nI love this place, I love that everything is fresh and it always tastes great!\n\nPrices are very reasonable for the quality of food you are getting."
1,"I finally got hungry around 1pm and just like the first-to-review person, I also missed the lunch rash. Because who wants that?\n\nI was happy to discover that they are serving Hiyashi Chuka. It's every bit as good as the OG Monta location on Spring Mountain. The service was quick. Sitting at the counter, I was able to see the guy making my dish right in front of me. He apologized for the wait, but it really wasn't much of one.\n\nMy only possible gripe is that I could have sworn the dish said $7.25 on the menu; I was charged $7.95. Not worth complaining about, so I just paid cash and left.\n\nI'll be back, especially since this is a good lunch distance for me. Just no rash, please."
0,"This isn't the worse place I've been. In fact the pedicure was really pretty good, but the manicure chipped the very next day! They aslo gave me a kind of hard time about paying with card, even though i tipped in cash. I only went here for a wedding and i don't think I'll be going back."
0,"I called for time on getting 2 new tires replaced and to see if they were busy. \n\nI was asking if it could be done in 30 min i was short on time. they even put me on \"" schedule\"" to make sure I was on the road on time. \n\nWhen I got there the guy who was helping me was not only not helping me but took a 5min call while i wait and didn't even apologize about the time. \n\nHe said it would be about 1 hour. An hour later he said about another 30min. \n\nThe service is REALLY BAD and if you have a schedule to keep don't come here."
0,"They screwed up. Had seen the show before the accident happened, but now I came to see it again and they totally ruined it. They've changed almost the entire show with very little acrobatics and nearly no battles. \n\nNot to mention the final \""epic\"" battle which is now a poor quality video projection. They should have removed the show instead of making it awful. \n\nShame on you Cirque, seen many others amazing productions and this one just doesn't deserve anymore to be under the Cirque brand."
0,I was here last weekend and I was very disappointed. The staff wasn't very friendly. And someone finally greeted me after I already looked around the whole store. \nI went in to look at their betta selection and I couldn't believe my eyes! All the bettas were in dirty water and there was even a dead one! I attached some pictures of how filthy their water was. It looked like they hadn't cleaned their cups in weeks. I was so upset I had to get outta there. \n\nDONT SELL BETTAS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO PROPERLY TAKE CARE IF THEM.

1,"Best Italian in Madison.  Ignore the hater reviews.  Get a reservation if it's a weekend.  Best advice is dine at the bar.  Pizzas  are excellent, calamari and Caesar salad solid.  Top 1% martinis.  Always ask about the specials."
1,"Does it help to be an alcoholic to work here? Just a rhetorical question. I'm sure it helps if you're a customer. I mean all those choices - I feel like a kid in a candy store. But it wasn't always this way with Total Wine. I remember when they first started popping up all over the place and I got a gift card for Christmas and I wanted to spend it all in one store but their beer selection was completely lacking. Wanted some Belgian beer - Ename and the guy trying to help me out gave me this DUH look and told me they didn't have it and he'd never even heard of it. To be fair, I asked someone at Bevmo the same thing and he HAD heard of it and they were available in their California stores but because of some Arizona regulations they couldn't stock it here locally. So I've been a discount card carrying member of Bevmo since then and one day I walked into this Total Wine and realized they had everything I could ever want right here in this store. No need to wait till the next time I went to California to get certain things. Sometime during the past 6 or 7 years Total Wine did a total turnaround and actually surpassed BevMo! as THE place to go for your alcohol needs.\n\nSo I'm not into Dave Letterman or MSN style top ten lists but here are my top 3 reasons to go to this Total Wine instead of the BevMo! on Ray and 54th Street:\n\n1) Selection is much better. Also, if you go online on Total Wine's site, they'll even tell you which aisle and which side of the aisle the item is located on. BevMo's site just tells you how many they have available in that store.\n\n2) Total Wine has it's own parking lot all by itself. BevMo! shares a parking lot with a bunch of other businesses and is pretty close to the Sandbar - I had a few close calls with some folks that I'm sure made the most of happy hour before leaving the parking lot. \n\n3) BevMo! closes at 9PM every day except Sunday - when they close at 7PM. Total Wine closes at 10PM every day except Sunday - when they close at 9PM. So you simply have no choice but to go to Total Wine if you waited too long to stock up."
0,"Annie's has many of the makings of a high end restaurant such as the prices and ambiance, besides that, it is sorely lacking. My girlfriend and I were seated immediately with the restaurant fairly busy. We were both surprised at how nice the interior was; dimly lit with old photos of the owners in their 1950s prime. It was very nice and felt welcoming.\n\nThen the problems started. It took at least 12-15 minutes for our waiter to come by (granted, someone came by to say he'd be by \""soon\"" and that they were very busy), but when he did, he walked up, said hello and introduced himself, then he went to go check to see if we were his table, then came back and said he'd be back in a minute and went five feet away to a table that had been seated after us and took their drink orders. It was absolutely ridiculous. Almost laughable. We didn't order drinks solely for that reason.\n\nWhen he finally did come by, we just wanted to order and eat since we were starving. Following that, it was another 15 minutes of waiting before we got bread (we had to ask). I ordered the chicken parmigiano and my girlfriend ordered the potato gnocci. The gnocci was great and being as famished as I was, I was so excited to eat my meal, only to be completely let down. The first bite of the chicken I spit out. I don't do that, but I had to. It was this chewy, rubbery texture that I thought was fat. It turned out the entire chicken was pretty much the same consistency. We deduced that it was a really cheap cut of chicken. At least it wasn't under cooked (which I thought it was at first). Regardless, it was almost inedible. Oh and $7 to split the check? Not that we needed to, but good god that's ridiculous. \n\nI just moved to town and I really wanted to like Annie's, but I saw little charm or reason to ever visit again despite the decor, which, unfortunately, you cannot eat.\n\nOne star is harsh, but I think in our case, it is completely warranted. If anyone had eaten the chicken I did or waited the length we did for literally anything that a restaurant should do as soon as you sit down, you would think the same."
0,"I hate to rain on the parade here, but my experience with Carlsson Family Eye Center left me with a pretty bad taste in my mouth. On the strength of the Yelp reviews, my partner and I made consecutive appointments for our annual exams. Neither of us has serious eye issues, but we find that our prescriptions now change on pretty much a yearly basis. Dr. Carlsson seems nice enough, but there were a couple of red flags right off the bat.\n\nThe first had to do with my contact lenses. Carlsson charges a $115 \""contact lens fitting fee.\"" I've been wearing contacts for about five years now and have never been charged such a fee. Being new to the area, we thought maybe this was standard procedure in Arizona. Nope. Turns out that when the Carlsson clinic submitted the expense to our insurance (I'm a public employee, so we have EXCELLENT benefits), they rejected it as a \""qualified expense.\"" In other words, it's not a fee that insurance companies typically pay.\n\nSince we were already in for $115, we decided to try and make the best of the situation. Dr. Carlsson recommended bifocals for my wife--strange, since she really only needs glasses to read at night-- and we priced replacing lenses for her current frames. This is where we started to get mad. Carlsson Eye Center wanted to charge us in excess of $500--just to replace lenses! This seemed exorbitant to  us, so we called our old optometrist in another state. By comparison, they charge $50 per lens for bifocals. Needless to say, we opted not to purchase from Carlsson. \n\nWhat's more, my wife has MS, but has never had an issue with her vision. That being said, we routinely disclose her illness so that it can go into her records. Dr. Carlsson asked to dilate her eyes to perform a more throrough exam. Not a problem, but he wanted to bill as a \""medical\"" expense. This would have run us another $300 or so out of pocket, since Carlsson is not a participating provider on our medical. Of course, the real problem here is that we've NEVER paid a \""medical\"" fee to have our eyes dilated. Again, I thought this was a routine service on most eye exams.\n\nThat leaves the matter of my contacts. Despite the fact that I'm an experienced contact lens wearer, I had to see Dr. Carlsson four times. He gave me four different sets of contacts, none of which worked for me. The problems ranges from poor depth perception, to discomfort, to imjust plain couldn't see. On one set, i couldn't even identify dreeway signs. Prerty vad considering my current lenses get me pretty close to 20/20, but aren't great for closeup work. I finally asked my old doctor for my prescription from last year, as at least I can see reasonably well with my old contacts. At that point dr. Carlsson wrote me a script for my old contacts--although he told me that they were only 2 week wear lenses. Subsequent investigation revealed that they are indeed monthly wear lenses. Grrrrrr!\n\nThe kicker, though was when I went to purchase my contacts. Having never paid more than about $60 for a six month supply, I was absolutely shocked when the office quoted me $160 for a six-month supply. A quick call to my old doctor proved it--they'd send me the same prescription for $88 , including shipping. The next day, I went into Costco and found it for $55. Now, I don't expect that a small operation would be able to match Costco prices, but more than triple the price is a little outrageous. \n\nTo his credit, Dr. Carlsson did give me an extra set of lenses for my trouble. He does seem knowledgeable and caring. But just be prepared to pay quite a lot for his services. To me, it's not worth triple the price for the same services and products."
0,"Our night started off at another location, but after the mood wasn't set quite right by the staff, we had started to look for another place to come and dance. I had pulled up The 1OAK website on my phone to get information, meaning what time they  open, music, and what not. I could not find a 'dress code' section on the website.\n\nWe drove to the Mirage, and was instantly turned away by the doorman. Not because I was dressed poorly, but because I was in \""flats\"".\n\nMy designer, not cheap \""flats\""..........\n\nI would understand if I was in a pair of dirty flip flops, but I wasn't.\n\n I had told him that I recently had a procedure done, and he said that it didn't matter. WOW. Is your place ADA approved??????????\n\n It was the \""dress code\"", (that I can NOT find ANY where, might I add. I'm looking on my laptop right now.) Their dress code is not posted outside of the club, on their website, NO WHERE. He said that I would be a \""liability\"" because I wasn't in heels and that the club has had \""glass break.\""\n\nWhat? What does one even have to do with the other? I'd much rather step on broken glass in flats than high heels....or is that just me?\n\nI am absolutely disgusted that because I can not physically wear high heels that I, as a customer was turned away. That I was a \""liability\"" because I was in flats, when I'm sure you know that some of these girls are a liability in themselves, because they can barely walk in those damn things! \n\nIt's funny that the one thing I did find on their  website, was Rob Kardashian in a simple black tee, and a baseball cap, but I am not allowed to wear flats? \n\n..............Pretty interesting dress code.\n\nI just wonder that if I would have brought a cane, or if my friend had pushed me in a wheel chair if I would've been turned away too, since I wasn't in heels. The doorman didn't even offer me a manager, or some one to speak to.\n\n I am surely disappointed, this, was truly a \""1 Of A Kind\"" experience. I truly felt discriminated against, I never plan to return to 1OAK, and I plan on letting a lot of people know about it.\n\nI have contacted 1 OAK, and they said that they do plan on ***adding a dress code section to their website.... Something, in my opinion, should be posted anywhere and everywhere in the first place. \n\n^^^^^^^^^*EDITED**  5/21/13*^^^^^^^^^^^^\nHere's the quote from their website,\n1 oak las vegas . com\n\n\""Our Dress Code can be described as \""upscale chic.\"" Hats, t-shirts, chains, excessive jewelry, athletic wear, shorts, baggy attire, sunglasses, sandals/flats, and tennis shoes are not permitted. Entry is always at the doorman's discretion.\""\n\nJust keep in mind Rob Kardashian...... Black tee... baseball cap. This business isn't run correctly. It is very biased, and you would probably enjoy your time somewhere else... Take it from a local.\n\nBest of luck."
1,"I have never eaten at a Quizno's before, so I cannot compare to that, but I give this restaurant a 5 out of 5 for a fast food style place because:\n\nStaff was freindly and wanted to make sure I had an ideal experience.\n\nThe facility was clean.\n\nThe food was quite Yummy in the Tummy, and priced appropriatley.  \n\nThe service was fast."
1,"Cant beat it for a $5 lunch.  Great pizza, very fast service, clean establishment."
1,I had a friend pick up some #1 combo sandwiches and it was crispy delicious and just enough sauce. Bread was fresh and really crisp.  They called in the order and sandwiches were good to go. I think it is yummier than some of the lees in la.
0,"LOL. You are probably wondering why would you stay here? My friends and I stayed here because we got comp'd since we go to Vegas often. We chose this over Flamingo/Bally's/Paris (sister hotels) because our friends were staying here as well. And boy, we heard all the horrible stories...and I must say, most of them were true. \n\nIt was pretty gross, I think this place is the cheapest on the strip, but quality is also the cheapest on the strip. I never had high expectations, but it was pretty disgusting. The room was small and outdated, stains on the ceiling. The balcony floor was dirtier than the streets of Vegas. The windows were thin as hell and there was this one car alarm that kept going off. The hotel was confusing to roam around. The parking structure is old as well, and to enter it was old. There were 4 elevators that went up and down, and you literally have to wait 10 minutes to get on, there were a LINE of people for the elevators. Rooms were stuffy, old AC system...Hallway floor were old and dirty, everything was reallly outdated. \n\nGood drink service though. Not many tables. Some of the dealers were very rude. It was overall everything I expected though...dirty, disgusting, and yuk. \n\nOn the brighter side, I heard they are going to put $30 million to rennovate this place! Hopefully it'll be better!"
1,"Frequent this place so much that they  should make a plate in honored of my name !\n\ntry the pasta shrimp. Its awesome. Hummus. Greek salad. Greek friends. The burger is amazing. The water is amazing too !( I joke about their plain, same, filtered.water... It is refreshing though)"
1,"I have to say, these fish tacos are mighty good.  \n\nI was reading an article in Charlotte's edition of Creative Loafing and the writer mentioned ordering two specific tacos which found to be delightful. Having live most of my life near the coast, I have a rule about eating seafood so far inland. Yet, I've heard nothing but good things about this restaurant and I was literally a block away..so how could I resist?\n\nI ordered a BBQ Mahi taco, which I'm told was featured on 'Diner's, Drive In and Dives.'  The fish wasn't as fresh as it would be at a beachfront taco stand and the sauce was a tad sweet for me, but that was nothing a little hot sauce couldn't fix. \n\nI also ordered a Tavaroo Tuna taco, which had a hint of wasabi and was fantastic. \n\nIt was early Saturday night and the dining room was filling up quickly, so I say at the bar and could observe everything coming out of the kitchen..and it all looked delectable.  \n\nNice margarita menu and beer selection too."
0,"This is the worst place ever! The first room I checked into was infested with bugs, then they moved me to a room that obviously had not been cleaned since the prior guest left. I called to complain and they told me to use the extra blanket in the closet, since the comforter on the bed was dirty and stained. Then a few days after I checked out my credit card was charged a $300 cleaning fee, for nothing!!"
1,"Why why why don't I play laser tag more often? It is SO much fun! And I think the prices here are quite reasonable. I compare many things to the price of a pint in MTL which I'd say is around $7-8...One game (~20mins) of laser tag was less than 10$, so like an expensive pint of beer, but for your additional toonie you get:\n-To stalk your friends in the dark (or strangers, whatevs)\n-To pretend you are in an action film!\n-To trash talk!! And to come up with a super cool handle\n-To run around, up and down, or just chill in a corner and shoot laser beams at an angle into a mirror to shoot unsuspecting victims.\nWhat's not to love?! If you have a group and on a timeline, make a reservation! We showed up on a saturday at 5pm and had to wait til 6:15 to play (but luckily those pints I was referring to earlier were just around the corner to hold us off). We were 9 \""adults\"" (questionable) and fun was had all around. Enjoy!"
0,"Eh, ok so this hotel is one of the few in Scottsdale which accept pets so I thought I'd give this hotel a try.  Great location.  Very central.  Assuming it would be a rather easy stay as I am traveling on business and will be out of the room from 8-5 (I own the company, so I bring my dog into my office during the day as well).  \n\nI have to say...it may be because I have a \""dog room\"" but the room is no bueno.  There are scuffs all over & just plain dirty walls.  The \""touch up paint\"" clearly didn't match and makes it look even more cheap.  The Carpet is a dark green color yet you can clearly see stains all over it.  II mean every 6 inches.  I'm grossed out walking on bare feet....haven't taken my flip-flops off other then in bed.  The office chair upholstery is pretty nasty as well.  Having a refrigerator in AZ is a must...IF it actually worked.  My very weak fridge forced me to hit a gas station, buy a cheap cooler and a bag of ice just to keep my water cold.  Slightly below room temp is all your getting out of their current appliance.  \n\nWood furnishings are nice, linens as well.  But the cleanliness is seriously, seriously lacking."
1,Great beer selection! The lobster rolls are amazing. Service is just ok. Hung out here with my husband and watched some sports on our mini get away! Had a good beer flight but kinda pricey. Then again it's Vegas and everything is expensive. Good knowledgeable bartender (girl with short blonde hair and tattoos))! And then there was a crabby bartender who looked like a mean Russian dude! Good hang out to chill at the bar and watch sports! Nice outdoor area to people watch!
0,"We had been their costumer over 6 years now and we're finally moving on, their poor costumers service had exceed anything I ever come across. The last two month we paid the bill with cash in the store but they seem to have lost the records of any bill being paid and they are charging us fees over fees. I personally try to go in and show them the payment that was made but they give me a hard time. with 30 minutes of arguing and explaining they finally removed one fee, \n\nI got to say I am disappointed how much they have changed in costumers service. I really hope they will turn around and give more happy costumers their time and services that they want and deserve."
0,Purchased a voucher on Living Social and was hoping to have a good experience after reading reviews and doing some research on the internet. However it was far from that. I showed up for the appointment and was told it needed to be pushed back a little bit. I waited an hour and half at the salon. He just skipped out on the appointment. Failing to provide any communication via phone or text. Very unprofessional.
1,"This is a new restaurant in the neighborhood. We were hesitant at first. However, once  our salads arrived, the taste was great and the veggies on it were generous. My daughter had chicken on her salad, the chicken was an entire grilled breast, much more than expected!!!\nThe spicy Thai salad dressing was great. We will be going back. My only suggestion would be to have more veggie options for the build it yourself salad, like cucumbers, carrots, mushrooms, etc."
1,"Same wonderful food as the old school South Phoenix location I know and love, but the attempted recreation of the quirky atmosphere misses the mark.  We felt like the servers were a bit less attentive than at the original as well.  \n\nBottom line:  Order something off of the \""House Specialties\"" section of the menu or the Special board, specifically anything with Adovada ribs (I just tried a special of soft tacos yesterday....YUM).  If you order a run-of-the-mill taco or burrito, you're going to get a run-of-the-mill taco or burrito.\n\nLos Dos gets extra points for serving yummy beans too....I'm not a fan of refried beans because of the weird texture; these are left whole with some sauce and have tons of flavor.  And that green salsa?  I'd drink it with every meal if I could.  Awesome, awesome!"
1,My parents....both of which are 92.....moved to WMV two years ago. They could not be more pleased.
0,Omg horrible service here. Went in this morning to fill up. Knew I had 20 cents off from Vons rewards. The attendant gave me major attitude when I forgot to give him my Vons number and refused to void the sale so I could get my 20 cents. Never ever going here again I will call my insurance road service if I run out of gas rather than deal with the snooty jerks here.
1,"Nicole B. wrote, \""I really dont want to write this review because I dont want people to find out about my little diamond in the rough!\"" and that is EXACTLY how I feel!  I make about 2 to 3 trips per year to Vegas, and I always stay at the Carriage House (probably for about 5 years, now).  Seems like a lot of people are finding out about the secret though, because now there are times when I have trouble getting a room here.  It was never like that, a couple of years ago!\n\nI have nothing but good things to say about the Carriage House.  It is close enough to walk to the Strip (1 block), the rooms are clean and nice, and the service is great.  I once complimented the service to someone at the front desk, and later on that day, room service showed up to my room with a complimentary box of chocolates.  That was nice of you!\n\nThere is no casino attached, but Planet Hollywood is literally right across the street. Once I'm done partying all night, it's nice to come back to a really nice, quiet room. Carriage House is great!"
1,"I'm a fan of this spot. Maybe I am bias because it's my neighborhood spot. Aside from running into your occasional ball players and athletes, the energy at this location is a reward in itself after a workout. But it's always immaculate, the staff is always happy and friendly and the service quick. Fast food this way is what I call my idea of a happy meal!"
0,We found nothing we were looking for.  The staff was incredibly rude. I do not recommend visiting this store!
1,just fell into this place today and WOW what a gem  GREAT sandwiches  I had the super sicilian and it was fantastic!  great meats  great toasted bread  great cheese and great dressing  wish I had found this place sooner  I will be back to try their pizza which is only served at dinner.  friendly staff and great service   one of only a few great sandwich shops I have found in Phoenix    a MUST TRY!
0,"The food was gross and the service was rude and slow. It took us over an hour just to get out of there, and there were only 2 people in the entire restaurant. I don't want to waste time even going into detail over it cause I feel like enough time has already been wasted on this business."
0,"I try not to support Walmart & Whole Foods is closed when I do my shopping , so I come here.  But every single time I say \""never again\"" somehow I end up here. I can never get over how the parking lot is so completely  gross. Carts are always every where, its like an obstacle course just to get in. Then theres the garbage all over the ENTIRE front of the store. Come on , ten minutes tops to sweep up this mess & make it look a little cleaner.  Wtf? The produce area was recently made over but it still looks under construction. Self check out is ALWAYS a problem. Don't bother saying you have your own bag when the machine asks, it registers as I NEED HELP to cashiers and causes a scene. Last night, all 6 self check outs were broken , the guy in charge just let us all stand there without explaining to us the problem. I give up!"
0,"No Shamrock shake for me, just a McDouble and a Diet Coke to quiet the rumbles. Even though I was clear with my order to be eating in, it still arrived in a to go bag. (He also forgot the drink, but was reminded by a supervisor.) I took a table where I had a view of the counter and watched the same guy miss two other drinks.\n\nMy burger was a little on the messy side with ketchup and chopped onions outside the bun.\n\nFree wifi is a plus and the parking is good. But I would have to say that I've had better experiences at McDonalds. Give this one a miss."
1,"Best pizza downtown. Hands down. Finally a pizza joint that rises above the rest. Pop Up Pizza is as artful as Pop Up Art House in Henderson. Think a hybrid between Neapolitan style and New York style. Exceptional ingredients that are perfectly portioned with the crust. Oh the crust, light, yet firm, a with a nice crunch on the edge yet soft and pillowy inside. The crust in the center holds up to the toppings with ease. By the slice, by the pie, heck buy the slice or buy the pie. Four styles to choose from with an additional 4 on the way in the next few weeks...including a vegan variety. An entiere pie will run you about $22, by the slice-$3.50 Pop Up Pizza is located on the south end of The Plaza, just as you enter the front door from Main St. Run, do not walk to this place. Soon the lines will be out the door, up Fremont Street, then all the way down Las Vegas Blvd to the Secret Pizza Place at the Cosmo. Yeah, it's that good."
1,"Love this place! This new restaurant is set in a Spanish villa and has a fun and classy ambiance! There is a huge patio complete with small firepits and an outdoor bar.  There is plenty of parking available as well. \nThe menu is Tex-Mex. There are plenty of delicious vegetarian options. Everything is reasonably priced, and the food is delicious. Would DEFINITELY recommend the Calamari as a starter. This is probably one of the best versions of calamari I have ever had. The guacamole, salsa, and cheese are pretty good, not the best. The tacos are delicious!\nThey serve beer, wine, and cocktails. They have a very creative and interesting cocktail list. \nGreat ambiance, delicious food, great drinks, and reasonable pricing. I will definitely be back!!"
1,We went in late and we were still greeted with smiles and fantastic serves. Great pizza and salad. Thank you
0,"Went here before Roger Waters/Pink Floyd concert. There was a line and it was taking long. Not a big deal as it was busy before the concert. While watching what was going on, you could tell there was a problem. All the pizza's were sitting there but no one was serving them to the patient people in line. The nice lady in front of me complained and ask the guy if he was the owner, which he said yes. The guy could care less and had a major attitude. After a short interchange, he just refused service to her and told her to leave. This is by far the worst service and attitude I've ever seen from any company, anywhere. For the owner to do this, its in excusable. This is an opportunistic business and could care less about serving people. I wonder how they take care of the food we eat, yuck!\n\nPlease do not spend your money here and let's send this guy a message!"
1,"I had a very nice dinner here recently with a large group of people.  The waiter clearly knew his stuff, had a charming accent, and made excellent recommendations.  I wasn't very hungy, so he suggested the beet salad with goat cheese.  It was excellent, as was the bread they served with olive oil.  The cocktails and wine were reasonable and delicious, and the owner served us all complimentary guapa after dinner and came over to thank us for coming in.  We had a conversation on the patio afterwards, and he was clearly passionate about good food and scottsdale, and I'm thankful that he has moved into the neighborhood.  Will definitely return for dinner with the BF."
0,"This was the second time going here. I got a fabulous hair cut, although it was much shorter than I requested.\nMy second visit was for highlights and it was a bad experience. I had no knowledge of what the process was, and the man who was doing my hair barely explained what he was doing. At the end, the color was great, although much more than I wanted. \nThe issue wasn't until I went to pay. I was shocked at how much it cost, the stylist had never gone over any \""extra charges\"" with me. I was charged $50 more than I had planned on spending, for glaze (which I wasn't even aware of, the guy never mentioned this) and toner, which he did mentioned but said nothing about the price.\nI was too much in shell shock to really do anything and so I paid.\n\nI will be canceling my future haircut, mainly because I was not told about the extra charges and I felt I was taken advantage of. \n\nOther than this, my experiences were pretty well, aside from him straightening my mixed race hair without blow drying it first. My hair felt fried afterwards!"
1,"I am from New York where pizza is king.  Joe's pizza is the closest to NY style pizza west of the Mississippi.   Crust and cheese is excellent.   Staff us as long friendly,  attentive and fin.  They have TVs so you can watch football too.  Worth the drive off the strip."
0,"This place is dead to me.  \n\nI've been going here for years and used to be a regular for lunch.  The service went way town hill a couple of years ago so I stopped going as often but would occasionally go if I didn't have afternoon meetings.  Not anymore.  The service just isn't slow it's terrible.  I walked out after 20 minutes of no service today, the place was only half full and one of the waitresses was prioritizing bussing a table instead of taking care of guests.  \n\nToo bad, the food is actually decent."
1,"If you can get there early and avoid the lines - this place is AMAZING. Great selection, delicious food and good service."
0,"Well,  I really like my color, but I'm not sure if I like the color at my roots or the color on the ends. I won't be going back.\n\nFirst of all, when I go to a pricier hair salon I don't want my hair person to be doing other people's hair in between unless it's a quick guy's cut while my hair color is lifting.  \nI actually called a month before and left a message to set an appointment and they never called me back.  Bad business, should have been a sign.  \nThe girl I saw was really nice and a pleasure to chit chat with.  MIght be more fun over coffee instead of my head. \nI told her I hate, hate, hate red and when I got home the first thing my dad said is, \""It's red.\""  ARRRGGGHHHH\nI had a coupon, so I said yes to the blow dry.  The blow dry was 28 bucks and she did a half-ass job.  It was the worst style I ever had.  Had I known I could have used my coupon for product too I would have used it for that instead of wasting it on a crappy blow dry.  \nIt's not the worst color, and luckily some of the brassiness will tone down after a few washes, but I still won't be going back.  \nI'm so glad I didn't let her cut my hair.  I got my hair cut at Focal Point Salon near Desert Ridge and it was the best haircut EVER and I am a pain in the butt when it comes to haircuts.  I will be getting my color there next time and looking forward to it. \nI do not recommend this salon if you do a full color and expect it to be the same from root to end."
1,Wanted to give a shout out to Aaron. Great customer service and very friendly. He made our time at Freddy's very enjoyable.Thanks Aaron for the wonderful service.\n\nThe steak burger was awesome and really enjoyed the chocolate ice cream with brownie concrete .
1,"THEHotel is one of the best hotels in Vegas with access to all of Mandalay Bay's amenities as well.  This is one of the more hip and upscale places to stay.  The service and hospitality seemed to be pretty decent, and when it wasn't the management made up for it in other ways.\n\nEntrance can be a little hard to find.  Seems to share the self-parking structure with Mandalay Bay.  Location is also not very convenient for walking.  Be prepared to take the trams to Excalibur or grab a taxi .\n\nWe just got a standard suite, but it was pretty nice.  Recommend you ask for a room facing the Strip.  Bed was comfy.  Nightstand had a clock radio with iPod interface.  Bathroom was huge with a small flat screen TV on the wall.  Even had another 1/2 bathroom (perfect when you are sharing a room and can't wait for your roommate to get out).  Tub was huge and had a nifty waterfall spout.  Robes and slippers were available in the closets.  Only complaints would be the charge to use the internet.  You'd think a high-end place like this would avoid the nickel-and-dime stuff.  Also the TV didn't have any HD channels, but then again who is wasting their time in Vegas watching TV in their suite.  Not me!\n\nWe did one of those online promotions that included a few extras.  2 for 1 at the House of Blues.  $20 Sand dollars for use at the beach cafe.  $10 free play at the Beachside Casino.  These ended up being a bit of a pain in the ass trying to redeem.  We complained to the front desk and the manager threw in $50 credit for room service.  Sweet!  Having breakfast delivered after a late-night out was pretty darn nice considering the early 11AM checkout time.\n\nIf you love the sun and water, you have to check out Mandalay Bay's beach/pool area.  Body surf with the machine generated waves.  Rent an inner tube for $20 and float around the lazy river.  (Better yet, buy or bring your own inner tube and have them inflate it for you at the rental spots.  You can buy them at the CVS pharmacy on the Strip).  The only downside is the long hike through the MB casino to get to the pool area.\n\nMy friends and I had a great time at THEhotel and we can't wait to come back."
1,"Surf and Turf! Surf and Turf!\nThe lobster was buttery and yummy and came in the perfect proportion. The steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it and was perfect.\nI liked the fact that the menu had prix fixe options as well as a la carte. We ordered a few side dishes for the whole table, so it was nice to try bites of multiple sides. They were all good, but the sweet potato puree was delicious.\nA few people at the table got lobster bisque as the first course. They said it was great and filled with lobster, but too heavy to eat right before steak. \nThe service was attentive and very helpful.\nThe atmosphere could have been better. It was so big and didn't feel very intimate. It almost felt a little cafeteria like.There was a small group of us and the table shape wasn't condusive for coversation. \nThe bill was pretty big, but actually not as bad as I thought it would be with five people and wine."
1,"I live around the corner from Bien Nails and I am so glad, because the staff is warm and friendly. The only complaint I have is of the constant attempt to \""up-charge\"" ($5 for this or that). \n\nEvery service I have had has been done with care, professionalism and quality. I would recommend them to anyone but remember to turn down the extras you don't need or the bill will get up there!"
0,"This place is just an open pavilion with bars and random t-shirt stands.  Don't get the wrong idea, it's not meant to be an entertainment hub (though they do have kareoke) but if you're looking for cheap booze and some drunkie hottie singing off key, this is your spot."
1,"Really good macaroons. They are definitely on the sweet side but that's how I like it. Quite a decent variety (including one decorated like a bee for the kids). \n\nGreat price! 1.65 each, or 6 for 10. \nReasonably close to metro station\nTakes credit card\n\nWe went twice during our 3 days in Montreal"

If someone contacts me and explains what happened I'd be glad to remove my rating. But until then, I guess they are out of business."
1,"This place is awesome..Locals told us about this place a few years ago and we always make it a stopping point whenever we go to Vegas(like in 3 hours:-)..They even have video poker if you want to gamble..The buffet on Sat/Sun morning is awesome..If you like/love Mexican food, you definitely want to stop here...Very easy to find....Pete"
1,"The people who gave this below 4 stars must of accidentally walked into Mcdonalds.....\n\nAs a UNLV student this is just a 10 second walk from my classes, They food is hot and always fresh and the burgers are juicy with great sauce. I've been to some great burger places in NYC but still non have surpassed In-N-Out for me!"
0,"If this is paradise, I'll stick with the mediocre lifestyle I live from day to day.\n\nAwful, sums up my first impression of the place.  I was greeted by a revolving door that looked like the windows hadn't been cleaned since the last time Jimmy Buffet was in town.  We were seated at our booth, but before I could slide on in I asked if they would wipe the liquid off of the seat.  I went to the bathroom and washed my hands (the bathroom is another story) When I came back, the liquid was still on the seat of the booth.  The waitress just sluffed off the fact i was agitated by the lack of customer service.  Seriously.  How hard is it to wipe off the booth.\n\nThe food was decent.  Nothing great, but ok.  Portions are weak however.  You'll probably have to venture across the lot to McDonalds for a Big Mac afterward if you want to be full.  A Big Mac would probably be as flavorful as the burgers served here. \n\nWhat irked me about my trip here was the service.  First was the lack of caring when it came to the booth's cleanliness.  Second, I never got a refill on my soda.  For $2.49, I'm sure jimmy could afford another glass of soda.  It took our waitress nearly 10 minutes to collect come back with our bill.  It was like they took my debit card and walked to my bank instead of swiping it to collect payment.\n\nThey get two stars because I didn't have to choke down the food.  However I think I'd rather get in my old car, drive to McDonalds, and risk the chance I get explosive diarrhea before climbing into a sailboat and pointing it toward Cheeseburger In Paradise."
0,"We were just at coyote ugly and had an absolutely horrible experience. We went to the washroom and then the bouncer Martin Hampton would not let us back in. No one is an angel in vegas, but we were clearly not out of control. He claimed we  were and we are parents at almost 50 years of age with three boys. I don't know what they were up to, but they ruined our evening. When you are wrong, that is fine, but this situation baffles me. Don't you want business? and i write this note in the clearly inebriated state that they assessed me at? \n\nAVOID"

I couldn't even find the grilled onions and the cheese whiz, just the sadly bland meat.  The fries were good.\n\nThe setting is noisy and has the feel of a college campus eatery."
1,"Definitely the dive bar to go to in Vegas.  Bartenders are friendly, drinks are cheap, and the food next door is pretty great!\n\nLow pressure, wasn't loud.  Just make sure to order a water from the tap.  Otherwise you are paying $2 for 8oz of water!\n\nNot touristy at all, not worth leaving the strip for, but if you end up around it, for sure worth the stop.  If I moved to Vegas it would be my local dive."
0,This place serves extremely oily appetizers that are extremely salty. Not a fan. They have ipad menus for self ordering which is becoming a standard at all you can eat sushi places these days.
1,"Don't need to spit a gang of info. Hands down best theatre I've ever been. Super comfy, super clean, giant spacious seating with slick chairs that all recline. No space issues here, as each chair is a personal throne. Go enjoy so films. You won't regret it."
1,"We stumbled on the place while going to get coffee at McDonalds.  I alway like local places better than chains.  What a great surprise. \n\nFirst of all, it was spotless.  These folks know how to keep a clean place.  We were greeted as if we were old friends. \n\nThen we found out what this donut shop was all about.  They make your donut to order.  Wow.  \n\nSince we are \""old school\"" when it comes to donuts we kept it very plain.  Just cinnamon and sugar.  \n\nThey were the best coffee shop donuts ever.  Really.  Hot, fresh, and practically melted in your mouth.  I could have eaten more, but my wife only let me have two. \n\nThe staff was friendly and gave us some tips on where to go in the area. \n\nGreat coffee and great donuts.  Please bring your store to Mass.  We need some better donuts. We inflicted Dunkin Donuts on the world.  Our punishment is not having these guys near by."
1,"Correct address is office 109, 1100 Av Des Canadiens-de-Montreal.  It is located in an office tower in the East side of the old Windsor station.  Best access is through an entrance on the East side of the old Windsor station halfway down the Peel hill between Av Des Canadiens-de-Montreal and St Antoine, then take the elevator up to the 1st floor.  Metered parking is generally available right at this entrance on Peel.  Access is also available to the office tower through a door on the East side of the old station concourse.  I dropped my Omega watch and broke a strap-to-bezel securing pin.  Helvetia provided a new pin and fixed the strap in just a couple of minutes at low cost.  Very happy with their service."
1,"Eric and his staff are the best foot massage located on flamingo and buffalo. Same parking lot as Hikari sushi. Clean, peaceful, relaxation. Great one hour and a half foot and whole body massage for $35! Such an awesome deal! I cant wait to get back to Las Vegas this May to go every night while Im there!"
0,"I went with a Chinese friend who ordered in Chinese.  When one of the dishes arrived and she didn't like the look of it she then shouted a lot at the waiter (in Chinese).  After that the food was exceptional.  Easily the best Chinese food I've had in Central Illinois.  (I admit, that's a low standard.)\n\nHowever, I've never been able to recreate this experience.  And how I've tried!  I ended up asking my Chinese friend to write me a note in Chinese ordering these same dishes from the Chinese menu.  I show the crumpled and worn note to the waiter when I go by myself.  But the food is never as good.  I expect it was the shouting.  Now that my friend has moved away, I expect it will never be that good again.\n\nWithout my friend to help us, this is a mediocre place."
0,"Mmm there are many places that offer \""clean eating \"" with more flavor.  Their sauce is ... Just weak , no flavor :( so sad because I would love a healthy yummy option near here .   \n\n2 stars came only from good service , manager and servers were very pleasing just my tummy was not pleased .  \n\nAlso their \""side\"" veg option sucks , it's just one Huuuge order of same plain veg.   Needs mixing up option.  And people , huge loads of white rice is never the best \""clean\"" food lol"
0,"The fillet was excellent. My wife's salmon was overcooked, so we returned it.  The next salmon was cooked properly, although I make a better salmon on my grill than what we were served - it was average. Generally, when you send food back that was cooked improperly the restaurant will comp something, but that did not happen. The server also did not mention that to substitute asparagus for the potato is five dollars extra. Otherwise, the server was attentive and friendly. I mentioned to the manager on the way out our experience and instead of offering to make things right he said he wished he had been informed earlier. DC Steakhouse has prices that reflect upscale dining, but is not run to the standards of a fine dining establishment."
1,"I love the all-inclusive (Vietnamese, Thai, Lao) menu and the decor, and when the place isn't busy the service is fast and friendly. We live down the street so we've eaten here a handful of times since they've opened and we've learned two things: 1) just because they ask you how spicy you want your dish and you say 4 stars, it doesn't mean it will have any actual spice (they forget?), and 2) if it's busy we go somewhere else. The main problem seems to be consistency, both with the service and care with which the food is made. Other than that, I'm happy with their food and have yet to have a dish I didn't like. The pad thai is fantastic; the bun lovely and cool when it's hot outside; the pho deliciously hot when it's cool outside. Most dishes range in the $9-15 mark for dinner and $7-8 for lunch."

0,"I was referred here by a Lawyer I was using last year for some matters. Even though he had never used this firm himself he had said this per John Mertz came highly recommended. He had experience in the situation I was dealing with.\nWonderful! I made an appt. Gathered all my papers together and went in for an Appt.\nEverything seemed fine at first, I gave me all my information and he seemed as if he understood my type of job and how we were paid.\nHowever, he did not complete my taxes on that day. He said it would take a week.\nAlright then, worse things could happen.\nThe worst part was, Mr.Mertz did not do my taxes. A new hire assistant did them.\nHe called me a week in to it and wanted me to explain to him how I was paid. I said you have the W2 form there, I have been assured that Mr. Mertz knew how to do it all.\nWell, Alas Mr. Mertz is far too busy to complete my taxes for a mere $200.00.\nSo 2and a half weeks later when I went back to pick up my Taxes and pay the $200.00 I had told them on the phone they were not to file them until I got there and reviewed it.\nWell the girl working the desk kept pushing me to sign it. I reminded her that I had spoken to her not more than 30 min. prior with instructions not to file them.\nBottom line is , I paid the $200.00, it was done incorrectly and I would tell everyone never to go there again. Unless you want your taxes to be incorrect and have to pay far more than you should.\nTHEY ARE NOT WORTHY OF YOU TIME OR MONEY!"

1,"One word, confusing. \n\nI'm from the Bay Area California. I know a thing or two about malls and shopping. This mall is pretty awesome. It's huge and has all the stored I could eve hope for. However, whoever designed the floor plan really sucks. SO CONFUSING. It's like a maze and with sub levels. WTH.\n\nSome highlights of this mall:\n+ Tesla\n+ Yard House\n+ Madewell, Tory Burch, Pandora\n+ a movie theater!"
1,"Now that Ruth's chris has closed it looks like we found a new steak house !! Priced high but very tasty. I liked the decor, dark and rat packy.  Service was great, I had the bone in rib-eye , with broccoli & mashers. My date loved the huge lobster tail !  My steak was perfect, the big broccoli bushels were yummy and the mashers were great .They included a free chocolate layer cake that was incredible . Loved the location also ."
1,Without a doubt one of the better (and quieter) hotel options in Vegas. Room amenities - as described by previous reviewers - are unbelievable. 5 stars if Platinum introduces a shuttle service to the Strip !
1,"Yes! Somewhere with non-watered down ice coffee!\n\nIt's definitely a rare treat for me when I order an ice coffee that doesn't end up tasting like coffee-flavored water with ice. I do realize that if I wanted that, I shouldn't be ordering an iced coffee, but I do what I want. \n\nAnyways, with a good selection of coffee and teas, you will surely be caffeinated enough to crank through that 10 page paper due 5 hours ago. \n\nThere's a fair amount of seating, including a back section that I just recently discovered. The seats are pretty close to each other though, so prepare to get comfy with whomever you're with."
0,"Stay away from this place unless you are OK with a 1 - 2 star establishment. The rooms are musty. The air conditioners are below par for Phoenix and you will feel like it's too hot, even with the AC on full. Breakfast is lousy. I also had a hard time with their no pet policy. I did not realize that pets were not allowed. I was changed $100 dollars for a pet, but was not advised that I would be charged, so imagine my surprise a month later when I see an extra $100 charge on my credit card. Days Inn Inc. and their Sunburst rating system exaggerate the hotel's quality giving them four out of five Sunbursts. That's like four out of five stars. Orbitz, Yahoo and Trip Adviser average between 2 - 2.5 stars. There are better places to stay near the Airport."
0,"Drove past this place the other night and made a note to stop by and check it out. Well tonight's the night. \n\nI must say that it's a modest, nicely laid out location with a small but good selection. \n\nThat's about where the fun ends though. It hasn't been often that I've walked into a cigar shop (almost anywhere for that matter) where I haven't felt welcomed, but I have to say, this is one of those shops. I'm not sure if it's because of the great time I just had at Majerle's or if I was interrupting the game (which I came in to watch) but I simply \""wasn't feeling the love.\""\n\nI smoked an Arturo Fuente Hemmingway which was perfectly moist and relaxed with my iPad for most of my visit. The clerk (proprieter?) literally said three words to me the whole time \""cigar?,\"" \""$9.99\"" and \""Thanks.\""  No offers of joining the rest of the guys, where you from?, what do you like to smoke?, not even \""Do you want to smoke here? Need matches, etc\"" Although the guy after me at least got the last question. \n\nAll in all, a pretty disappointing visit. Selection was ok, but I can find that anywhere along with a bit of camaraderie. Therefore I'll take my business and friends elsewhere next time. If you decide to check it out, I hope you have a more enjoyable time."
0,"Gave my deposit to a tattoo artist named EZ and they day I showed up for my tattoo, he was a no call no show. He did have my phone number written down so calling or a text shouldn't have been that hard. After talking to several artists who had no idea where he was, one told me his father passed away and she will have him call me. He did call and we rescheduled for 3 weeks later. I show up and again he was a no call no show. Again his father had died. How many times can someone's father die??? So once again someone said he will call me and this time he never did-- and I never got my deposit back.  Supposedly he is part owner of the shop too. Very unprofessional place, poor customer service from the general staff and they steal your deposits."

0,"Just got back from taking my Friends' to enjoy a great place to eat and WOW is all I have to say. I speak highly of this place's food and atmosphere, until today. Now mind you, I can overlook one speed bump but I will make notice of it and today was that day. Our server, who goes by Server #10 was (to use his own choice of words) \""A DICK\"". Yes ladies and gentlemen, he chose to use that word when taking one of our orders and referring to himself (strike two in less than 5 minutes) while explaining an item not being offered as an option. So many ways he could have handled the situation, but he chose the more ignorant, abrasive and disrespectful manner. To make a long story short, I allowed my company to choose his tip and feel free to leave a note on the receipt informing him of his misconduct. I will still go there, but I will not be contributing to his income nor will I expect that anyone else who works there manage their customer interaction with unprofessional language (unless of course you know your customer like you know your Mother). And even then, if you speak to your Mother with that mouth you shouldn't be in public service where your interaction makes your living. If management chooses to take any action, please feel free to note the receipt reads #346070, where my friend clearly stated how she felt. If we, as professionals would speak to our Students' or Patients' with such language, we would have some sort of action taken upon us. Why would this be allowed in a restaurant setting is beyond me."
0,"Serrano's is to Mexican food as Friday's is to American food.\n\nThat is to say Beans and Rice are to French Fries as Corona is to Budweiser.\n\nWhat I mean is Chimichanga is to Cheeseburger as Salsa and Chips is to Bread and Butter.\n\nSo you have Quesadilla to Pizza as Margarita to Cosmopolitan.\n\nIn summary, Two stars is to restaurant ratings as Die Hard is to movies.  \n\nIt'll get the job done but it won't be memorable or soon repeated."
1,Breakfast was solid! My wife's Brooklyn Benedict was outstanding and Jacob's Slammer was plenty for breakfast. What we also loved was the fact that we could bring our dog to the restaurant. So while I probably won't be in a place to go back often I would recommend it if you are traveling through Las Vegas or there for a vacation.
1,"You know about their food truck? No? You're missing out and so was I. \n\nLet's just say that their Lomito Complete sandwich was orgasmic enough for me to scarf down the entire sandwich. Accompanied with a mint lemonade and Mexican corn, well, that was delicious. I'm waiting for the line to be out the door on this small shop."
0,"Very unhappy.  From the moment I walked in (and yes, I had an appt) I felt like a burden to them.  As I sat down and looked at the nail menu I pointed out what I would like and they said that it was wrong. The prices were higher.  Probably should get new menus!  The women were snippy with me and didn't understand what I wanted.  It actually hurt when she was doing my nails and they looked really thick and odd when done.  I also said that I wanted them real short and she said \""why Waste your money then\"".  Wow, ok.  I don't think that is your business if I want to spend money on short nails.  Won't go back! Also, way too expensive especially for the service I received."

0,"This apartment is TERRIBLE!!!! I have had nothing but issues since I moved in 2 weeks ago. Not only did the staff misinform us on information about the apartment prior to moving in, but they called me 3 days before moving in to tell me that I have to wait another day to move in because the office is closed. We had this move in date set for 3 months. Now this may not be an issue to many people, but it was a problem for me because I moved from Chicago. I needed to move in the day I was planning on because I had no where else to stay. That was just the beginning though... \n\n1.) We realized a few days after moving in that we were charged over $500 more on our rent than we were supposed to pay. They did inform us that we paid $420 over. However, after reviewing the statement the office gave us, which included everything we were charged and have paid, it made no sense. Basically, we saw that they charged us two times on things that should have only been charged one time and all of the math was wrong. The amount they owe us just kept adding up. \n\n\n2.) We have ZERO cell service in our apartment. It is a complete dead zone. My roommate and I are also not the only ones with this issue. We have talked to other residents who have complained about having no cell service. This may not be the staff's problem, which we understand, but it sucks that I have to lay against my bedroom window just to talk to my mother because that is literally the only place I can get MAYBE 2 bars on my phone.\n\n\n3.) The next issue, which we have ben dealing with for about a week now, is our cable. The day we moved in the staff in the office told us that we can get Cox or DirecTV. We decided on DirecTV. The morning the man came to install it, he told us that these things he needed to access on the roof were completely closed off and he could not access them until the maintenance people opened them. My roommate and I went straight to the office to ask if they could open the things on the roof. They told us it would be a half hour, so we had to send the DirecTV man away so we could make his other appointment. FOUR HOURS LATER, the maintenance people still had not fixed anything. I went and asked the office if it was finished yet and the lady helping me didn't even think to call the maintenance people to ask, she only thought to e-mail them. Pretty dumb considering a phone call would take much less time and she would get a response quicker through a phone. I went in the office again the next day to see if they finally finished the task, and they told me it was all worked out. \n\nSo the DirecTV man came back today. He told us that the maintenance people only opened one of the things on the roof and not all of them. When we went to ask the maintenance people to finish their original task, they were extremely rude to us. They also proceeded to tell us that WE need to go to all of the apartments above us and ask if we can get access to their utility closet on their balconies in order to drag a cord down to our apartment just so we can get cable. I find this completely ridiculous!! We shouldn't have this many issues just to get cable in our apartment. Also, the maintenance people should have done everything that needed to be done 5 days ago when we originally asked them to. They just did a half ass job and complained that they have \""too much to do.\"" BULL SHIT!\n\n\nI have only lived here for 2 weeks and I already hate it. I have never had more issues than I have had here in any other apartment I have lived in. The staff in the office have no idea how to help us with anything, and the manager is extremely rude. Not only was she a total bitch to my roommate, but she was even more awful to my roommate's mother. Completely disrespectful and not helpful one bit. The only good thing about this place are the amenities. The pool is pretty and they have a good gym. Besides that, I would NOT suggest living here."
0,"I'm not surprised this place is closing.  The staff was abrasive, the clothing was over priced, even on sale."
1,"Bouchon. Table for 3. Wednesday Night at 8:30.\n\nSat on the patio outside - pretty.  \n\nOrdered the Salade Maraichere au Chevre Chaud (mixed greens with red wine vinagrette, warm goat cheese and herbes de Provence) $11.  The salad was very good!  The only issue is that it was overly salted! I'm not sure if it's integrated in the vinagrette or if it's sprinkled on?  The goat cheese - DELICIOUS.  I skipped the mixed greens, and ate the goat cheese and bread together instead.\n\nEntree: Poulet Roti (roasted chicken with heirloom squash, rainbow chard, pomegranate seeds and sage infused chicken jus) $29.50.  The chicken is cooked to perfection!  It is so juicy and tender!  The squash is slightly sweet, and is absolutely wonderful, and tasted SO good with the chicken.  \n\nAlong with a glass of sauvignon blanc, the bill came out to be about $60.  It's quite worth it!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you head out to Vegas!"
0,"Not a fan...better options elsewhere and pricier than other self serve yogurt places.\n\nWeird flavors and the yogurt taste synthetic.  I noticed they use Stevia in some of the flavors and I can't stand that stuff.\n\nTake the extra drive to Yogurtland, you'll be happy you did.\n\n-Ryan"

1,"I mainly come here for the oxtail soup. Boytoy gets the Philippine breakfast. Had the Loco Moco in the past which is just soso. The oxtail soup is only served between 11 PM and 9 AM so there are always drunkards roaming around. Go earlier to beat the drunken clubbing crowd. On our most recent visit, some drunk lady was raving about how awesome her Otterbox phone case was and then chucked her phone at the glass display case in the front. The place briefly went silent as everybody looked in shock and wondered if that really just happened. That was too hilarious and I'm glad the phone didn't shatter the glass.\n\nI always get friendly service here.\n\nMinus one star because: THEY DO NOT HAVE SRIRACHA HERE!! I repeat.. NO SRIRACHA!! That is all."
0,"Mostly used this Goodwill location as a donation site.  My last donation experience wasn't a great one... I had packed up my clothes that either don't fit or I just don't wear anymore into a nice box.  There are some pressure strips that probably alert the staff as you drive up to the donation door so someone comes out and helps you unload your stuff.  The guy didn't really say too much... must have been a long day.  I usually don't ask for a receipt unless I donate electronics and such.\n\nI do remember taking our old family computer here back in the day.  It was pre-IBM386, but was still in working order and had a rad amber colored monitor.  The staff thanked us for the donation and then proceeded to chuck the computer and components into the large bin with all the other electronics... guaranteed that the computer had a 50% chance of not working anymore.  Oh well."
1,"This was the most beautiful ceremony, and if you get the photographer, they like to take a lot of pictures. But my only tip is to show up maybe a day before to sign all the paperwork and everything so that you won't be waiting around in your wedding dress while guest start to show up while they file the paperwork away. Other than that, everything went smooth. The drivers were awesome and knew all the side roads so we wouldn't be late. My husband and I had a great time and enjoyed everything."
0,"We were here 3 - yes I typed three - hours for a meal with two little kids.  Very long waits between the courses with no attention from server.  Of the three hours at least 60 full minutes was spent without any food in front of us.  But the best part, incorrect charges on the bill.  Wines prices upcharged on actual receipt to 1.5X the price listed on the menu.  I asked the manager on duty why there was a discrepancy and he went behind the bar, got some cash and gave it to me.  Now mind you, it was of course, no where near the amount I was overcharged but I guess it relieved his conscience.  He handed me the money and said \""It will take me too long to find out who your server was and look up the transaction, so here you go.\""  Unreal!  Food was average to below average and prices for what you get were a real rip off.  Original style broth that was recommended was so chock full of pepper you were downing water all night - if you could get a refill.  Save your money and time - go buy a fondue pot and do it at home.  You do all your own cooking here anyway so why not.  Will not return.  Hope this saves others a bad experience as well."
1,"As with all my reviews, my review of Teharu will compare the food relative to price. Who cares about service right? Go to China and tell me about service. Food is first and foremost. \n\nNigiri. $1\n- Salmon: average quality for being priced at $1, wait how can I say that since I've never had $1 salmon nigiri???? its $1 and throughout my 4 years of going here, not once has it had a fishy smell. No fishy smell = $1 well spent. \n\n-Tuna: similar to the salmon there is no fishy smell, and is $1, this equates to good spending. \n\n-Tamago: not a big fan, had it once, was good. I can't really judge because I dont ever eat tamago but as stated earlier its $1, thus, no mold = $1 well spent. \n\nNigiri $1.50 \n-White Tuna: generous cuts given the price. I must emphasize price, some yelpers may disagree here with the cuts but relative to price it is very generous. \n\n- Hamachi: Great and consistent generous cuts. \n\n- Saba: They never have it. \n\nNigiri in General. \n\n-Uni: Hardly anyone in phoenix eats this stuff which means its hard to find fresh, its a shame because I love this stuff but am too scared to order it here. \n\n-Amaebi: I would not get this, like the uni, many arizonians do not like this stuff. They are unable to turn this stuff over quickly because of this the amaebi like the uni have a significantly longer cycle time, long replenish rate = no bueno! \n\nConclusion\n- Good bang for buck! Being a supply chain alumni from ASU I am all about being cost effective, and this place is the knees bees of cost effective sushi dining. Get full off of sushi for under $10? This is unheard of and because of that I give this place four stars. Economically friendly sushi is hard to come by, and at prices as low as a dollar for nigiri, if it don't stank I'll have a drank! :D"
1,"Liked it lots. I had the mixed grill, that had marinated grilled chicken, grilled steak tips, and a ground meat strip with spices. The accompaniments were a yummy salad with some yogurt dressing, lovely creamy hummus, and a small dollop of creamy roast garlic. They had grilled the pita and used the inside of it to slightly \""soak \"" up the juices from the meats. It was just enough to moisten it, then it was sliced in about 8 pieces. It was fresh, light, perfectly herbed. Just the right thing at night time.\nNot really busy like other places"
1,"Cheap tools galore.  I have bought some power tools, hand tools, and even an air compressor from here.  Everything's hit or miss.  Some stuff works as well as the name brands and some stuff fall apart after a few uses. I would probably stay away from the more expensive machinery and any precision equipment(I wouldn't use their torque wrench to rebuild my tranny, but I would use it for tires)."
0,"Have you ever gone to a steak house and lost weight? If you haven't, try BLT, as you'll not take home a doggie bag...ha. Is it also bad that the best part of the evening was the background music? I love me some Dobie Gray :) \n\nWent to BLT for restaurant week today and was not impressed unfortunately. I'm from Chicago and love steakhouses, and have spent my fare share of $$$ on Charlotte's finest ones. BLT doesn't rank in the top 5...sorry. \n\nDetails: Ordered the beefsteak salad, hanger steak (med rare) and the tart dessert. Sides are included (all 3 of them). We had a party of 4, so I of course asked the size of the sides. The nice waitress said \""family style\"", which was acceptable though I asked her if Id get the same amount of sides if it were just two f us, and she said yes. I then asked (with a smile) how many sides we'd get if there were 6 of us, and she said 6. I pointed out the math didn't make sense, but said I could order additional sides off the menu if I'd like. I thought to myself that I'd just bring more people next time. \n\nFood was average. The sides were in a small dish. Trust me, small, and if you've been to any other steak house, you'd agree. Hanger steak was more rare than med rare, though I don't mind. Flavor was pretty good. Unfortunately the experience was sub par and I won't be returning. \n\nTIP: Hotel bar and restaurant bar have different liquor licenses, so make sure to finish your hotel bar drink before going into the restaurant."
0,"1.  The 15 minute wait to be seated was unnecessary.  There were 10 empty tables when we were seated, but yet there was a line waiting to be seated.\n2.  The 5 minute wait for our server to show up was way too long.\n3.  The service was forgettable.\n4.  The food was too expensive for the level of service we received.\n5.  Note to manager.  Hire some more servers.  Hire servers who know their income depends on their level of service they provide.\n6.  The food was ok, but over priced for what you get.  There are other BBQ restaurants charging half the price, and better service."
0,"Bleh, sorry Denny's but I'm not a fan. The food is awful. More times than not, so is the service. I only came here two times for breakfast because the other nearby restaurants had a wait and I was starving. But next time, I think I'd rather start gnawing on my own arm."

0,"Ok, so...   Vegas Local, just made it to Aria 2 days ago. (apr 3)  I wanted to really like this place being that its part of the next big thing in Vegas Resorts.  However, Aria left me a tad underwhelmed.  I struggled the entire time I was there trying to place what it was that just didnt do it for me....  was it the scent? (smelled like burned Vanilla something or other)  Was it the feeling of an oversized banking institution?  WHAT was it?   I still couldnt figure it out.. but it just feels very impersonal.   I dont know, maybe I am a snob and it bugged me that didnt have anyone opening doors at the porte-cochere.  Maybe Vdara, Mandarin and Veer are THE places to see at city center... It definitely was not Crystals or Aria.   : /"
0,"The food was good but OVERPRICED.  The setup was exactly like the old spot.  I thought the old location forced them into a cramped space but apparently,  they like it that way.  Service was good.  The $12 specialty margaritas DID NOT produce a buzz and I COULD NOT taste the tequila. Yes, I SAID IT, 12 DOLLARS!!  (Pint size with ice)  I guess if i order a $12 drink, I expect to taste some liquor in it and it should probably come in a giant margarita glass, like at Arriba's.  I think that the owners are cheap and trying to lure a snooty crowd that likes to show their friends how to properly waste some perfectly good money!!!  I had been to the old location several times.  Won't find me coming back to the new location though.  You've failed to retain an old customer.  Oh,  and the valet parking is just irritating. I walked out and there's my car, parked 20 feet away, and I gotta wait for the guy to get it for me?  All those blue cones are enough to piss ya off!!  What other place in Phoenix is like this?  I had a hard time finding my way out!!"
0,"I don't really get this place.\n\nHonestly, I don't find the beer menu that extensive. Compared to other beer-centric bars I have visited, the selection did not seem that great (and it was rather repetitive at that). But I am no beer expert so maybe true connoisseurs will say that the selections they do have are excellent... I wouldn't know.\n\nThe food is pretty tasty, particularly the many variations on mac & cheese, but not worth going out of your way for.\n\nFinally, the service is dismal. On two visits (one just for drinks, one for food), we have had a shockingly brusque waitress.\n\nNo thanks."
1,"Best chinese food in Mesa. My family has brought me here since I was an infant, and I am happy to say nothing has changed, not even the atmosphere! The food is awesome, I suggest the happy platter for 2 for an amazing appeteizer, and get a mai tai while you're at it. The service is perfect, never having to wait long for a refill, and also make sure you try the mustard. It will make the hairs in your nose stand up. I love the dark atmosphere, kind of like a dive bar of chinese restaurants, but never dirty. A great neighborhood chinese restaurant, and my favorite! Think of it as something you may see in the movie Big Trouble in Little China, but with customers."
1,We went here for breakfast at 4:00 AM.  The scrambled eggs & wheat toast were extremely tasty.  One of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  A definite must try if you are staying at the hotel.
1,"Awesome customizable breakfast burrito\nI was in the mood for a breakfast burrito and attempted to visit Baja Fresh 3 doors down, but alas this branch is not open for breakfast.\nLucky for us it was not!\nWe walked down the block looking for something to fill our bellies and this place called me in!\nThe ladies behind the counter are amazingly friendly, helpful, and wonderful at their craft!\nThe burrito options are wide open! Pick what you want in there, and they do it! I got carnitas, beans, cheese, and bacon and included the potatoes inside!\nSo super yummy! And the red spicy sauce was great! ask for 2!\n\nWish i lived closer so i could try more of the options for lunch!!"
0,"Taste of pizza excellent but it arrived lukewarm on the table and the dough was \""mushy\"", wet and not cooked enough. Nice place with helpful waiters but  we came to taste the pizzas that were described as great by the Arizona Republic food critic. Too bad but we will not go back"
1,"This is without a doubt one of the coolest places I've stepped foot into since I moved to Vegas. I've had Rocket Fizz bookmarked for a while and today found me over on West Sahara with 15 minutes to spare. Thanks to the Yelp app and GPS I realized I was only 2 minutes away so off I went. It turned out to be one of the best last minute decisions I've made in a long time. \n\nWhere to begin? Taffy! The North wall, at least 20 feet of it is lined with a long row of various flavors of taffy! I grabbed the big bag and smiling from ear to ear had a field day picking out various flavors. Then it was on to the cooler where I found sasparilla root beer, and all sorts of bottles of soda pop, some of them I haven't seen for years. And we're not talking the HFCS types, we're talking cane sugar sodas! The good stuff!\n\nI asked the owner if she carried two things. Abba Zabba bars, and Chase Cherry Mashes from the Chase Candy Company in St. Joseph, MO. She had both! This was very dangerous territory. I was the proverbial overgrown kid in a candy store with various payment options at my disposal. Must show restraint, must show restraint....I kept telling myself that. I exercised that restraint and kept the damage to $12....this time. But next time I make no promises. \n\nThis is a wonderful store with things you won't find anywhere else. Toss in service with a smile and I've got a new 5 Star, Best of Las Vegas favorite. Oh and the taffy? Awesome, AWESOME STUFF! You  really gotta check this place out if you haven't already!"
0,"Sorry, Black Chile... I just wasn't a fan!\n\nJared and I felt like trying something new one night last week, and after reading about how great Black Chile's burger was from our friends at EaterAZ, we thought we'd give this place a shot.\n\nThe restaurant itself is spacious, the hostess and service attentive and friendly, and the decor is tasteful.  But unfortunately the food was nothing special, and I won't be rushing back...\n\nWe started with chips and salsa.  I think they bring these to everyone.  These weren't bad.  For our meals, Jared went with the burger and I went for the fish tacos (per our waitress's recommendation) and a side of corn.  I liked the sticky rice and beans it came with but the rest of the meal was underwhelming.  Jared didn't love his either.\n\nSince my visit, I learned that this concept comes from restaurateurs Michael McDermott and Jason Merritt, who have been involved with the development of numerous restaurants including the famed Kona Grill. I thought it felt a little chainy!  That explains it ;)\n\nI'm pregnant so I didn't have a Corona or margarita, which may have made my meal taste better, but regardless, I've experienced much better Mexican food before... and with so many other Mexican concepts to choose from in the Valley, I probably won't be rushing back. Lo siento again, Black Chile!"
1,Asked around for a unique dessert in Montr\u00e8al and was told about the mille fuille at Chez Delmo. It was amazing along with their chocolate hazelnut torte! Had a bellini too. Our bartender was really great to talk to. Will go again when I'm back in Canada.
1,"This week we hosted our Annual Sales Meeting at the Hampton Inn on Highland. First off, the staff was amazing. They were the highlight of our stay. From the front desk staff to the event managers, they were always friendly and on top of all of our needs. The space they were able to provide us was great even though we made changes at the last minute to the head count they did everything possible to make our conference room comfortable. The continental breakfast was great - including waffles, bagels, breakfast meats, coffee, and healthy options too. This helped us to cut down on costs for providing breakfast for all our out of town guests. All in all, I would highly recommend the Hampton Inn for a work conference or a family stay. They have great amenities like a heated pool and the staff is incredible."
0,"**upset**\n\nI miss my Nordstrom at Tyson's and Houston Galleria.\n\nService - let us start off with the lack of customer service here in the shoes and jewelry department! How could you just give me a once look over and greet the person behind me? Well, thank you Charlotte's Nordstrom. I will stick with Neiman's."
0,"What the hell Tom Colicchio?!?!?!  My blindfolded cats can make a better sandwich!  I'd give it -5 stars but I can't. \n\nHubs and I were at the pool and wanted some food.  Since we've been long time fans of Tom on Top Chef we thought we'd give it a try.  We weren't surprised by the prices (it is on the strip, after all) and expected the sandwiches to be top notch.  We ordered the slow roasted pork and flank steak.  I should've known this was going to be a problem when I didn't see the cheddar in the steak sandwich.  It said \""aged cheddar\"" on the menu, why wasn't it on my sammie??   Ehhhh, I wasn't going to walk all the way back to the eatery from the pool.  I thought to myself, \""I can deal, I'm sure the rest will be yummy\"".  Boy was I wrong.  If you like some bread with a sliver of meat and a pound of salt, this is the place for you!   I'm pretty sure the high school kid at subway can assemble a nicer sandwich than this.  Not only were they thrown together, there was barely any stuff on the bread...  not to mention my forgotten cheese.   And it was sooo salty!  \n\nSorely disappointed, Tom.  How come all the other food you make on TV looks so good?  You've really cashed in on your fame.  I'd write him a note expressing my concern but I know it won't reach him and he's too busy raking in $$$ to care. \n\nLooking for a good sandwich on the strip?  Try Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood."
0,"The food is good but the service is awful. I placed an order online and waited three hours without my order being delivered. I call after and hour and a half and was told my order was on its way to me. I wait another hour and nothing so i called again and was told that they tried several times to contact me, my phone never rang. They also told me they tried to call me right after I place my order to let me know they could not deliver it, why didn't they tell me when I called? I will never order from here again. So very disappointed."
0,"This mall is sad. You will actually feel bad for this mall. Only a couple shops are open and they are either shoe stores, clothing or cell phones. The food court doesn't make any sense and not very inviting. Also there wasn't a mrs. Fields cuz I was craving cookies. Lol\n\nYour better off going to the flea market for better stuff and cheaper prices!"
0,"Review is for the frozen bar.\n\nOverpriced, even for Vegas. Not nearly as good as Fat Tuesday or Lime Ice."
1,"This place has been on my radar for the past couple of months, but I would never find myself in the position to get to this part of town from where I live.  I did finally get to try it this past weekend, man, have I been missing out!\n\nDon't judge a book by it's cover, this place is easily hidden away in a strip mall off of Park Rd. Extension.  It really lends itself to the whole vibe and feel of the place.  The servers are super relaxed, but you are well attended to... and it really feels like a cool neighborhood regular spot.\n\nWe tried the wing sampler... that lets you get 5 different flavors with 25 wings... we thought we would have some left over but within 30min... the plate was clean and I was super happy we decided to eat wings that evening.  On a hot kick.... so we tried the Hot Garlic, Honey Hot, Hot Teriyaki, Jerk, and Lemon Pepper flavors of wings and all of them were pretty awesome.  After trying the five I would definitely get them all again, especially the honey hot.. nice mix of sweet and fire.\n\nMy favorite part was looking a the women's restroom door and seeing a sticker that says, \""I [heart] Peckers\"".... sorry I just reverted to a ten year old....\n\nAll in all a great experience!  Definitely need to check out trivia night and the other flavors on the menu!"
0,"We were highly disappointed in this establishment, especially after pointing at it all week and thinking that it might be a cool spot to have dinner.  Sigh, more fools us.\n\nWe came in on St. Patrick's night and the place was quieter than every other restaurant on the Fremont Street Experience, which should have been our first warning.  We ordered a pitcher of White Peach margaritas and the \""average burger\"" nachos for me, Daddy's Supreme chicken taco for him.  Then we waited patiently, expecting the drinks to come out first.\n\nNo such luck - here comes the food.  I look over at my husband's plate and see this really sad-looking taco shell with a bunch of filling in it.  There was more plate than food, and I had a nasty feeling that the rest of the experience wasn't going to be much better than this.  My nachos, at least, had some substance.  But... they were just okay, not great.  The cheese sauce tasted like reheated Cheez Whiz, there was no bacon whatsoever to be found, and the onions were minced so finely that they just disintegrated the moment they touched my tongue.  I was bitterly disappointed.  \n\nTo make matters worse, the margaritas came when we were nearly done with our food.  Bad, bad timing.  We were pretty much ready to pack up and leave by that point.\n\nOnce the drinks came, the experience was slightly better - but, hey, I got drunk.  If it takes getting me drunk to improve things... (and my husband will tell you that he has never seen me tie one on like that, ever)\n\nFinal insult:  the bill was 53 dollars, making it the most expensive meal we had in Vegas over the course of a week.  It wasn't close to being worth that.  My husband honestly didn't want to leave a tip at all, but I convinced him otherwise.  \n\nIt never did get any busier while we were there.  I see why it didn't now.\n\nThe only reason why 2 stars - the food was edible and the drinks packed a punch.  But that's it. Servers were polite but in the end did nothing to improve our experience here.\n\nNot recommended."
0,"I LOVE sushi...and if I could eat this for every meal, I would! I usually go to the same places...but I decided to try some place new. Since I have heard great things about this place and I am in the area everyday, I decided to try Kabuki one day for lunch at the Tempe Marketpalce. I had been to their other location in Glendale before, and it was horrible service and their rolls fell apart with one touch. I give second chances though. So I ordered a couple different speciality roles that I have never had before at other sushi resturants. When my rolls came, I experienced the same thing I did at the other location...every roll I picked up fell apart! You can't eat sushi rolls when they fall apart as you try and put it in your mouth. Your plate is left with all the droppings and it really just takes the fun out of eating it. The service was ok, nothing special. They do have a rewards club called the Red Mask club where you earn points for every dollar you spent. I happened to go during a double point time so I earned more points for dining that day....but I highly doubt I will be back anytime soon to see the benefits of these points. I will stick with what I know until something else comes up!"
0,"I am sad to write this review... As I used to LOVE this place. However as of late, it's been hit and miss. More miss than hit. (Insert sad face here!) \n\nThe prices have gone up, serving size has gone down. I'm all about understanding the economy and what not... However this was the best part of eating here. \n\nI've learned that it's cheaper to order my food ala carte at lunch than as their \""special lunch combo\"". \n\nFor example; \n\nLunch menu - white rice, sweet sour chicken is $5 (roughly). However if you want the house fried rice (it's so yummy and filling!) it will cost you $4 more! What??!! That's right, almost the cost of the whole meal. So now it's $9 for the \""lunch special\"". (It used to be $1.75 up-charge.)\n\nThe second to last time I ate there after ordering my lunch (to go) with the upgrade and adding in fried won-tons it came to $14.79. Twice the price as a week before! No joke, it was!!!! First time ever I have never tipped them. Why? what they told me over the phone and then charged me were 2 different prices! The next time I went, I ordered ala carte and it was the same price but with WAY more food. \n\nBottom line - order containers at lunch if you want the rice upgrade. The food is good, which is the only reason I gave them 2 stars. \n\nMy stars explained:\n(1) location, ease of parking, lights, \n(2) how clean and organized they are, restrooms etc.. (they have never earned a star from me) \n(3) value. which I count as 2 stars 1 * for cash/debit/credit and 1 * for price of food vs quality of food, size of servings."
0,Called and asked for information about them and got hung up on twice. Sad because I waited about 10 minutes on hold only to get hung up on when I asked about the information on the website. All they wanted was my credit card number to charge me to become a member and I couldn't find out anything about them.
1,Best little tucked away spot in the hotel.
1,"I first experienced these delicious cupcakes last year during the Asian Food festival and was hooked from the first bite!  I've been to other premium cupcake places and enjoyed their offerings, but the alcohol fillings in SSC's cakes sets them apart.  Coming from a family of drinkers I wasn't expecting to feel much of a 'bite' from the fillings as they claimed but was pleasantly surprised to feel it on the first taste.  The cake quality is also as good or better than the other places, solid with minimal breakup and flavorful.  I'm a cream cheese lover so I adore their cream cheese base for the frosting, and they don't overdo it on the spreading; the other places tend to spread a bit too much frosting for my liking.  There are currently plenty of flavors to satisfy any craving and they keep adding more as they hook up with other brands of liqour; your favorite brand may show up someday.  Finally, the owners Lisa & Danielle are wonderful young women; very cordial, professional and committed to the sucess of the product, not to mention quite attractive, a plus in my book ;)\n\nAt $42 the price per dozen will be steep for some, but keep in mind that the ingredients are of premium gourmet quality and the cakes are made, baked and delivered fresh daily ensuring maximum taste and flavor.  You most certainly will be getting what you pay for.\n\nI strongly urge you readers to give these cakes a try; just don't get too drunk off them now, hear? (though that might be hard given they're so good)"
0,"This place is horrible when it comes to...well everything! \n\nLONG story:\nI had gotten started with the SW Dental in Chandler but I had moved to Laveen. I did not have insurance and I thought they would be more affordable for me to get my wisdom teeth out, plus already having a file with SW dental. The LAVEEN office was very unprofessional over the phone when telling me they \""dont transfer files from other offices\"" and that I would be a new patient. (1st red flag). I asked if I should call the Chandler office and see if they would transfer per my request and the response was \""yeah yeah! do that!\"" (again, unprofessional).\n\nChandler office gave me NO grief on the transfer question and said they would send it over. I call Laveen, they said they got it.\n\n A WEEK later I went in for my visit to schedule the actual wisdom removal, and upon my arrival they told me to fill out the New Patient forms because they have not received my file from Chandler (why did both parties tell me it was sent & received??)\n\nWhen being sent back for Xrays (that have already been taken by the Chandler office), the tech must have been right out of school. She was all over the place and didn't know much about working the Pano xray machine. Pushing different buttons to see which did what, she was a finger-push away from clicking the button without my xray jacket. She comes back around the corner saying \""oh my gosh I always forget this, here put this on\"". Uh 2nd red flag! (luckily i didnt have to pay for them since they were \""waiting\"" on my file from the other location)\n\nUpon probing all over my mouth and reviewing the xrays with nurse, I mentioned I have high dentist anxiety and would like to have my boyfriend present for the day i have my wisdoms removal. They seemed real unsure about how to handle my request.\n\nI go into the clinic for the dreaded surgery day and I asked if my boyfriend can come back with me just until I was out. The response was NO because there would be too many wires and the room is not big enough. I took a lot of deep breaths and went back alone with the same dumb xray nurse i had previously. \n\nI sit in the chair and i am constantly fidgeting nervously and fighting back what i call \""nervousness tears\"". (I'm a big baby when it comes to the dentist). The doc comes in and was not of much comfort, just wanted to get it done and over with. No small talk, just dentist talk. They messed up the 1st time with the injection and had to try a couple more times before actually getting it right. Now i'm REAL nervous and I let the tears fall. The nurse then goes \""why you crying we havent even started yet\"". UH HELLO HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN MY ANXIETY TO YOU GUYS!!!?????\n\nThen I was out. \n\n\nOh by the way, No i did not get a followup phone call from the doc or nurse seeing how my post-surgery was going. \n\nAnd not to mention the ridiculous pricing for it all even with \""their\"" insurance. It cost more than my boyfriends wisdom removal he had done at the Chandler office. \n\nVERY DISPLEASED and HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND! \n\nHow are they still in business!?"
0,"OK so I have been trying to stick to this whole New Years resolution thing which is not easy. But decided to give this place a shot since they offer a few healthy options. Big mistake!!! OK so first off the service was good, and the place was clean except for the area in front of the soda machine. It really needed to be wiped down big time.\n\nI guess my biggest gripe had to be with the food. It was nasty!! Flavorless beans, dry chicken that was closer to jerky and a tortilla that seemed to change colors at the bottom. Not sure why but did not remember paying for a color changing burrito. \n\nNow I understand that this is just a take out place that is very similar to say a taco bell or Del taco, but the food is bad at these places as well. I have to say while the food is bad the service and free refills of horchata did make me at least feel they deserved the one star I gave them, but wish I could have gotten a refund. Sorry but the only person crazy here is me for thinking this place was going to be good.\n\nNever again"
0,"Pains me to write a bad review for a place that i think can succeed but gets in its own way.  \n\nWe headed here after a trip to the science center. The science center was great fun but our experience here was not very good.  I first ordered the burger which is usually a safe bet.  My waitress comes back and tells me they are out of burgers.  This was 1pm on Monday after the new year mind you.  Then I say I will have the steak sliders, nope out of those too.  Finally settle on Fish and Chips which were ok.  The fish was fresh but was not seasoned at all.  Chips were bag frozen so not much to expect.  Apparently the kitchen was shut down later due to lack running out of food and the place was actually turning away business.  The service was ok but really had to make up for the lack of the kitchens ability.\n\nThis is a bar and should probably stay away from serving food at all.  Judging by the other reviews this is a usual occurrence sadly."
0,4 of 6 meals have been total screw ups however the servers and bartenders are nice and they are closest to home so I kept trying hoping it was bad luck ...
1,A friend suggested this place and I was actually very impressed. This place is a little outside the box. I really enjoyed the bean and cheese as well as the potato gorditas. The service was alright and they were not very patient with a new comer but it was fast and able to be taken to go. Ill return to las gorditas soon.
1,"I went here for lunch with a large group.  I thought the menu selections were unique and gourmet.  We ordered the Fried Asparagus and they were lightly battered and fried to perfection.  Delicious.  My friend is Gluten Free and they have a menu just for GF items....she had some type of pizza that looked and tasted delicious.  We didn't have any alcohol it was a work lunch, so I can't speak to that."
1,"Two great tastes that go great together. Chicken and waffles. Listen health nuts or Lolo-virgins, stop grimacing a the instagram photos posted and try this place for yourself. You like fried chicken, and you like waffles so put them both together and try not to freak out. Very friendly service. Love the mason jar glasses and bottomless purple Kool-aid. We miss living nearby but always visit when we are in town. Also try the mac n cheese. Even the basic scrambled eggs are fluffy and delicious. Betty Boop. Betty Boop. Betty Boop. Trey Trey. Yep, that's our order. See for yourself."
1,"My first visit to Yoga Sanctuary East Side location was an expectation of a better studio than the West side. I came for Shawn's 2nd series of Ashstanga practice on a Saturday. The class was amazing! \n\nBack to the studio, a friend mentioned east side studio is a lot better than west side.  It is located inside a 2 story building/shopping center. I had to take the elevators or stairs to the studio. As I waited in the lobby for the class to start, it felt that I was more in an office environment rather than in a studio so I was disappointed.  Once I walked into the room where the class is held, it was definitely better! 2 huge windows and you can see the vigorous and mountainous desert oasis. It actually was nicer and I did appreciate a wonderful view during my ashtanga practice."

0,"Very nice service here, but the food was NOT good. We had multiple items from the menu, and none of it was good. The decor is somewhat depressing.\n\nAll in all, it made us wish we were eating Chinese in San Fran."
1,"I dig how small this place is. I felt super comfortable sitting on the floor and digging through the bargain bins. Everything is priced well. They had a decent selection for being a small shop, and when I asked about a specific artist, they recommended I follow them on Facebook, where they would absolutely list any of his albums they got it. I'll certainly be back on a regular basis."
1,"OMG!  I love living downtown for so many reasons.  And I got to add Torched Goodness to my list tonight.  I first encountered this gourmet food truck at the Wednesday Public Market on Bastille Day.  They were hosting a French Dessert Smackdown.  I got to sample the lavender creme brulee, which was heavenly.  But tonight, thanks to social networking, I learned before I even left work that food trucks would be on my very street for First Friday tonight.  My friend and I rode our bikes the mere block to the corner lot, where we once again encountered Torched Goodness.\nA cursory inspection of the menu revealed the clear winner: maple creme brulee with the optional carmelized bacon topping.  We're talking organically raised bacon and local sourced dairy.  Torched before your very eyes!  It should probably be illegal.  It's that good.\nDude is a serious foodie and localist.  And a super-friendly guy.  He's Le Cordon Bleu trained and loves what he does so much that you just feel good sitting at his folding table.  I give Torched Goodness my whole-hearted 5 stars."
1,"Oh Mill. You are so fun but overcome with college students so it's sometimes hard to enjoy your splendor -- until now that it is. Welcome Canteen Modern Tequila Bar. You are welcomed with open arms to Mill! You are trendy, classy, decently priced and tasty! \n\nWhen I hear the words tequila and bar, I immediately feel a phantom hangover coming on and assume that if I visit, I should be prepared for a long headache filled morning after. But, don't let that fool you about the Canteen. Although the tequilas are top notch and flowing straight from the border, there's much more than lime and salt to this place. \n\nLet me first start with the decor. It doesn't quite fit in with the divey feel of Mill but that's a good thing. Similar to the class La Bocca brought to the street, the Canteen has a classy edge to the decor. It's very open. You could easily have a large party here and still have room for more. There are two patios; one off the front and one off the back. The bar is spacious and there's also a patio off the bar -- so actually there are three patios! I thoroughly enjoyed the back patio. The tables are high tops with cushioned seats and umbrellas. The tables are far enough apart from each other that you aren't sitting with a neighbor and sharing your salsa with them. I could easily see this being a fun restaurant at any time of day or night and it's going to be a perfect leisurely spot to stay for awhile. \n\nNow on to the food. Delish! First of all, go during happy hour. Between two of us, we had two margaritas, two taco plates, salsa and guacamole and it was only $10 a person. The items on happy hour have \""hh\"" next to them -- and there's a lot to choose from. I think I pay more at a local Mexican fast food restaurant! And though the food is competitively priced, you wouldn't know by the taste. The margaritas are freshly made with lime juice and not pre-made margarita mix. I could absolutely tell the difference and while I'm not normally a huge Margarita fan, I could see these being dangerous and turning the night into a 5 margarita time. The guacamole was freshly made and had a good kick to it. We had the Cascabel salsa which is what I suggest. It was a tasty salsa to accompany the guacamole. When I saw that an entree comes with three tacos, I was worried it would be too much, but they are actually street style tacos so three is just the right amount. I left satisfied but not too full. I got the chicken tacos and my friend got the shrimp and we split. I like the chicken tacos better than the shrimp but they were both excellent. Add some of your guacamole and salsa to them and they are supreme! \n\nI think that Julian Wright did an excellent job adding a little bit more flare to Mill and I see this restaurant being a huge success. I would absolutely make the drive to visit again and make a night of it here."
0,"This is for the front desk and customer service/accounting review:\n\nI had to call 3 times when i had a question about the credit card charge that was made for room reservations.\nBefore making the call I emailed the customer service and never received any reply (other than the auto-confrimation of the email) \n1st call, not very good. the rep didn't help me at all without the guest names i had more than 10 guests. so basically they told me to find out which guests that i was calling about. ( If I knew which one, I would tell you or I didn't have to call! )\n2nd call, ok. had to explain everything again and got somewhat i asked for but I did most of the work and did not solve the issue. the cusromer service is terrible. i was on hold for several times and the lady wasn't very polite. \n3rd call, finally someone from the billing department helped and solved my issue but i was on the hold for 20min before i was able to talk to the rep. I explain what i wanted in 3 min. and the lady was able to help me in 2 min. \n\ni've been calling this hotel for more than 10 times because of our employee stays there but everytime they were not really helpful.\nWhen I make a reservation i had to repeat everything at least 3 times; the names, spelling, the credit card numbers.. everything!  (I never had that issue for the last 10 years i've been calling the different hotels and making a reservations. )\n\nAlthough they might offer a great price, I would personally never stay here. You have to do all the work and extra."
0,"The food was pretty good, but the place was filthy and the wait staff was beyond confused.  We ordered Korean BBQ, but instead of the normal metal grate over the flame they offered us a thick glass dish to cook our meats.  This worked less than okay, resulting in longer than normal cook times and much greasier meat.  Furthermore, obtaining water refills was quite a challenge.\n\nLater in the evening when we attempted to use the restroom, it was in poor repair, as well as poor cleanliness."
1,Neat coffee place that also serves beer!  I like the industrial look to their shops.  It's just a little pricey.
1,"Went to Tao this weekend for my bday and had a ball! Music and crowd were awesome with a mix of pop/hip hop and house music. The lighting also has a trippy, unusual strobe effect which I thought was very cool.  Cover is $20. I took off a star because there's zero seating unless you are in VIP. Also there's steps up into the club, so the combo of those two things + heels sucks. Other than that though, Tao was great!"
0,I can concur with Adam Z. Putrid diarrhea post consumption. Food is meh. Won't be ordering again
0,Normally I would write a great review about this place but today our oil change/ car wash took 4 hours!!! The quoted 2 so we came back after two and when asked repeatedly when the car would be done they kept saying any min as we waited for another two hours!! \nGet it together Danny's !
1,"I either work from home or travel for work.  Traveling for work is made-up of fast-paced, busy, and looong days.  I love that.  \n\nAt first, I loved returning home and working from home.  I still do - sometimes.  But I have a housemate who works 2 jobs and is only home to catch some sleep, so I find myself \""tiptoeing\"" a lot, which I don't mind.  I'm not a noisy person anyway.  Buuuut, the quiet does get rather boring when it comes to work.  Zzzzz\n\nMy colleague and I work in cloud, as she is on the east coast.  However, there are several occasions a year when we collaborate in person.  Instead of sharing her personal space at the hotel or tiptoeing in my home with a sleeping housemate, this space is designed to solve such challenges.\n\nCoBiz is a GEM.  Great open space filled with many desks of all sizes to suit your needs.  If you want a dedicated desk you can rent one.  The prices are Ridiculously Great in comparison to many other cities.  Actually, the prices are amazing in and of themselves.  \n\nPro's:\n- great hosts Kat and JR\n- energetic atmosphere\n- clean bright open space\n- lots of desks and tables\n- fast internet connection\n- conference rooms\n- they can host your event or conference in the evenings or weekends by pre-arrangement (of course)\n- a snack buffet of the healthy stuff as well as the not so healthy stuff (as a drop-in visitor, I like to leave a little \""thank you contribution\"" in the jar when I partake) \n- or bring BYOFoodStuff  there is a refrigerator and a microwave.  It is a community 'fridge loaded with water, and sodas, and sometimes beer for everyone.  If there is a particular beverage you are drinking slap a label on it, as you would do with any community fridge.\n- loads of nearby restaurants (to eat-in, take-out, or have deliver - Eat24 or Yelp)\nBonus- there is a Chiropractor who has his practice here. My colleague has engaged his services and was so pleased she has decided to try and fit in a session every visit to town.\nPersonal Bonus - it is a very short drive from my home\n\nCons: (not for me, but maybe(?) for you\n- It is one big open space with huge ceiling clearance; the sound carries.  If a person is playing music on the computer you will be forced to \""enjoy\"" it as well, unless you come prepared with headphones and your own beats.  Or, you might not mind at all. (okay. okay. this is a slight con for me too. I like my own beats darn it!)\n- The \""walls\"" within that encompass the conference rooms are about 7' tall and are open-topped.  They do block out some of the sound, but not all.  Let me be clear though: This is NOT a noisy place, like a coffee shop.  No one purposefully tries to be noisy.  I work here BECAUSE there ARE people around working on their projects, making their calls, having their meetings, and it makes for a stimulating environment.  \n\nTruly a GEM.  I think that I need to go ahead and sign up with a monthly pass."
0,"Completely uncommon for me to rate Chipotle low, but tonight's food service and prep of the rice & beans was horrible resulting in a very poor tasting meal.   Note, just last week I rated this same Chipotle 4 stars and it was deserved, but tonight makes me think this place is VERY INCONSISTENT.\n\nI was third in a line of four people, not a very busy time at all.  Server was in a rush, a inexcusable whirling tizzy and she didn't steam my burrito well, gave me half portions of rice, black beans and chicken.  It sat there next to the guy in front of me who had ordered the exact same thing and mine was embarassingly small compared to his.  It was blatantly obvious how skimpy mine was as the two sat next to each other.\n\nShe was in such a flustered rush that after passing mine from her station to \""topping guy\"" and then not seeing it immediately move as it was queued up behind the guy in front that she returned to move both 6 more inches as if that would get things out of her sight.  It didn't, but who cares if it takes a few more minutes?\n\nBesides a lack of flavors, the textures were affected too.  When I received mine the tortilla hadn't been steamed well meaning it was thick and cold rather than the typical warm and soft texture.  The Cilantro rice is usually a highlight but dimished and completely lacked flavor.  Black beans were nearly missing so their normally sweet flavor was semi-absent and the cold, thick tortilla dough dominated the flavors of this Burrito.\nMany of the tables were dirty and hadn't been cleaned in a while.\n\nSorry I stopped by.  \nYou want to see the service staff that made this such a bad experience, look at the photo I posted."
0,"So in all fairness, the course was actually very nice, but the rating is for the staff at the course.  I was playing with several friends who were new to golf, hence a par 3 executive course.  We were a slow going group, but we offered several times to let the twosome behind us play through.  They said they were fine to play behind us and were entertained by us.  All was good, and the course was nice for a par 3.  But the course marshall was an idiot.  On the 17th hole (read that again....the 17th hole), he rides up in his cart, actually picks up one of our balls in play from our tee shots, and rides up to our group and says we need to observe rate of play.  I told him it's the 17th hole, we've already teed off, so really, not a lot we can do at that point.  He was a jerk and gave us attitude.  If he had actually done his job he would have talked to us about the 5th hole. What a jerk."

0,"Don't know where/how to start this review - I will start with, if you can find ANY other place to send your family members for care, it would be in your best interest to do so.  My moms insurance company gave her no choice to go here.  Repeatedly I arrive to visit her and she is in a wet diaper and has been for a very long time due to the smell. I lost my cool and a nice person (wish I could remember her name, great smile, not a nurse, someone with authority) told me should would find someone to help.  She stopped a man in the hall and he gave her instructions to find a nurse.  Later I found out this man was the ADMINISTRATOR and he passed my need for help onto someone else.  In a nutshell, don't bother making a complaint the director of nursing will NOT return phone calls. Her name is Donna and the nurse who told me her name told me not to tell anyone that she told me her name as she would be fired. I could go on but it makes me more angry to think about it. Positves, clean facility, allows healthy pets to visit, decent food. Cons, unhappy nurses, poor care, no one who can help will listen at the management level."
1,"This is great food... Not sure how it's not rated 5!!! I have a very ethnic pallet, and for a random walk in... I wasn't expecting much! \nI will now be a regular!!! Someone mentioned not spicy enough... Tell them u want the level 10!! And it's a guaranteed ear popping, sinus opening, mouth burner!!! These people have serious service, and authenticity!"
0,"Absolutely unimpressive place. Came here due to the myriad of 5-star reviews. Drove twice around the carpark before realising this place is literally INSIDE the Lee Lee market, and there is NO sign, not even a sandwich board, indicating this on the outside! Went in and got seated immediately. Water brought out quick. Orders taken and served quick. That's where the delight ended. They didn't have the fresh coconut that I normally get so that was disappointing.  My \""large\"" pho was ok, but I wouldn't classify it as a large. Maybe a medium. Broth tasted ok. Hardly any of the sliced beef balls or tripe, or in fact much meat at all. Small handful of bean sprouts and a single tiny lime slice provided. My kid had the crepe with bean sprouts, shrimp and pork. Yuck. I had some - the crepe tasted bland and ten minutes later, cold (my kid tried his best to delay actually eating any, can't blame him), I wouldn't have served it to a dog. Wife thought her vermicelli and BBQ pork was okay and liked the \""fresh\"" taste, but thank god the fish sauce was on the side. Ugh. Absolutely NO table service after we'd started, not even offers to refill water. Had to get up and walk around to the tiny cash register to pay. Got back to table and sat down to wait for the kid to strangle down another couple of bites and that's when I had an ice water jug held in front of me as a refill offer. Nope, done.\n\nThis place is nowhere near as efficient or generous with their portions as either Pho Thanh (Camelback) or Da Vang (19th Ave). Those who think the prices are cheap need to understand that those prices are normal for a viet place. They're all this cheap, except the ridiculously-overpriced Rice Paper on 7th Ave. Go to Pho Thanh (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-thanh-phoenix), order the large pho dac biet for $6.75 and run a comparison of what you get.\n\nI wouldn't go back here."
1,"Love the power yoga, such a stress reliever. The place is open and warm and inviting. Great instructors the place is super clean and not over crowded. I highly recommend Bliss"
1,"Usually I get the Box Combo with four chicken strips, fries, cole slaw and the Raising Cane's secret sauce. I mostly enjoy the light breading on the chicken strips, it is similar to some corn flakes. The strips are always super hot, which is good for any quality food. Each Vegas store, from the ones I have visited, have some sort of pop art relating to Las Vegas and a famous velvet Elvis piece."
0,"We ate here on a Saturday night for a late night snack. The place is cute and good for people watching, but the food was disappointing. We had the french dip, hotdog and fries. Everything was on the expensive side and not very good. We would not eat here again. This was the third restaurant we tried at the Wynn and all were overpriced and mediocre."
0,Highlights turned out grey.. Hard to tell what your hair looks like in the salon because it's dark... Got home and I was mortified at how much I paid to have grey hair... I'm 26! I called and the manager was not in... I left a message to be forwarded to her. She called back and basically told me there was nothing she could do. That all of the stylists are on their own. So it would be up to the girl who messed my hair up to fix it. Obviously I didn't want her touching my hair again! They refused to give me even a partial refund so I could go get it fixed elsewhere. I ended up dying it with a box color to cover the travesty. Ugh still mad about that mess! Never would go here again.
0,"If you like Disneyland and waiting hours to ride rides, you will love this s*!t show of an office. My son has seen Dr Burford, Ky, Greenspon, Blank over the past 4 months Plan on being there all day. They moved to an even smaller location this week which is nicer than their \""prison\"" looking old location. However the prison setting is rather appropriate since their staff looks like a bunch of degenerates on a work release program. Do yourself and child better like I did today and fire these losers."
0,"When the Golden Corral first opened we were very excited to have one in our area but when we went the first time we were very disappointed with the way it is set up.  Everything is crowded and people are practically climbing over each other to get to the chocolate fountain.  Getting from one end of the food selection s to the other is almost like a balancing act trying to hang on to your plate while dodging people!  I figured it was still new and that's why it was so crowded so we waited a few months before trying it again.  Last nite was worse!  The restrooms were a mess, the floors were wet, there was no toilet seat covers in some of the stalls and again, it was so crowded you had to dodge people to get anywhere.  People were rude, kids were running around and yelling....  THIS time we didn't stay....."
1,"ok so youre not korean and you want to eat korean food. this place doesnt have the best tasting bbq, but they have a great selection.\n\ni remember a friend telling me once \""dude, thats dumb, why would i pay so much to have to cook my own food?\""\n\ni guess he'll never understand the gratification of cooking the meat to the way you want it.\n\nthe employees are tentative and constantly clean the grills when they get really dirty. all of their side dishes are really good and sometimes they have this seaweed dish thats sooo good. they used to have \""soo jung gwa\"" its a sweet cinnamon drink. they didnt have it the last few times i went.\n\nonly thing i dont like is that i think they dont turn on all the exhaust fans, or at least not on full blast. what happens is that the smoke isnt sucked up right away. you go home smelling like korean bbq and feeling a little sticky.\n\ni always tend to eat too much and regret it later. regret to the point that i am interrupted from my sleep, hours before i actually wake up because the poo train is coming at full speed and theres no stopping it."
0,"Casadee complains about having stripper clients and coworkers yet she does hair in las vegas, laughable.  Also since she's only an assistant a stylist she should be grateful for the clients she does have instead of insulting them right to their face.. once when she did my hair she was saying someone was tall and thin what more can a girl want.. well I was in her chair and im short and curvy and I happen to like my body I'm glad I don't have a 12 year old boy body and I'd be skeptical of any man who did like those type of bodies. She's just an immature assistant I don't know how her extensions are but her cut and color is ok not worth going back. This salon gets 1 star in my book because they employed such a rude girl."
0,"Don't know if the food is good or not - never got a chance to eat there.\nGot in line at the front and was second - they seated the people in front of me, then the guy at the front door (a little woozy with liquor-smell pouring out of him) mumbled \""jush a minute\"" ...........then he proceeded to go back into the restaurant. Line gets bigger behind me........when the \""host\"" came back, a couple behind us approached him and asked how long the wait would be. The \""host\"" mumbled something unintelligible, walked to the back of the line where he apparently saw someone he knew and escorted the group of four into the restaurant, past everyone else in line, making NO effort to communicate at all with anyone else....not even a \""Be with you in a minute\"".........I turned around and left, and walked a block down the street to Bandera, where the food was great and the service was even better.  I will never again even try to get into the Italian Grotto, as there are plenty of GOOD restaurants around Scottsdale where your experience can be so much better."
1,"My boyfriend took me here a couple weeks ago and it was absolutely worth the cold, rainy walk there. We were their last customers of the night so service was a little slow but the server was very nice. The food was amazing. I had the roasted duck and it was cooked to perfection. It was tender, juicy, and so delicious. My boyfriend got the veal and he has the most amazing lobster mashed potatoes. We also shared the pizza margherita and that served as a great appetizer for us because we were starving when we got there. We were both really pleased with the meal and I hope he takes me back there again sometime."
1,"Dearest Tang, \n(Please note: This is not another letter to my vag, even though Tang is, in fact, a euphemism for vagina.)\n\nI am writing to thank you for making sure my taste for sushi is at least a LITTLE appeased. Now, sushi in Edinburgh is prohibitively expensive (my favorite phrase). Like, I could probably get a flight to Spain for \u00a320 on Ryan Air and buy sushi while I'm there and come out spending less than I would have had I gone out for sushi in Edinburgh (as long as I didn't bring luggage). \n\nStill, your weird little lunch box prices (under \u00a310) that combine a teeny tiny bit of sushi with a bunch of other Japanese delights makes me feel full and happy and my hunger for raw fish satiated. \n\nYou also came down and asked what I thought about the new Bento Detox box, that I obviously loved because I basically licked the plate clean. And you're super for that, even if you just asked to be nice, I appreciated you pretending. Your brown rice skills are superb, as are you.\n\nThank you for my lovely meal, \n\nsteph"

NOW IT WAS A SUPER FAST DELIVERY...they did refund it and the manager was cool once I got there.....other than try and tell me nothing was burned.

0,"I had originally intended to submit an eloquent review of the horrifying service provided by Cox - but clearly it's not worth spending the time.  Mine would just be another in a long line of one-star reviews.  Suffice it to say that I am no longer - and will never again be - a Cox customer.  I hope all those who have a choice will take the time to read the reviews here, take them to heart, and find another provider.  Cox should be ashamed of both their unethical business practices and their horrifyingly bad service."
1,"I've been reading comics since I was 5 and have seen a number of comic shops come and go.  Sadly, the prevailing theme of all these shops is an elitist attitude and obnoxious interaction with the clients.  \n\nThis, however, is not MaximuM.  The guys at the shop are friendly, smart and fun to talk to.  Zac and Gabe are the best.  I call them almost every Monday to add titles to my box and they say \""No problem\"" and the books are in my box on Wednesday!  I can't remember the amount of times I have called other shops to do adds only to find them missing from my box AND sold out on Wednesday.  \n\nThe shop is great too.  You have room to walk, it's spotless and well lit.  Everything is easy to find.  The back issues drawers are always well organized and the prices are great.  \n\nThey also have events happening regularly.  Parties at the stores, free movies at Rave and great contests.\n\nTheir customer loyality program is unlike any other too.  It seems like I'm getting gift cards and free comics all the time.\n\nIn my 30 plus years of reading and buying comics, I can honestly say this is the best shop I've ever purchased from.\n\nThanks Jay and crew..."
0,"I want to forewarn the other Yelpers and Grouponers out there who have purchased the Fabulous Eyelash Extensions....\nThese are not the individual eyelashes that are applied directly to the eyelash...they are the eyelashes that you can purchase at any drugstore and are being applied using the \""same glue that they use to apply individual eyelashes\"", however are being applied to the lashline/lid.  I should have turned around and walked out right then and there when I saw the lashes on her tray. If not then, perhaps when I asked the business owner if she liked doing the eyelash extensions (while she was doing my brow threading) and she giggled \""I make money\"", or when my lashline/lid started burning and my eye nearly wouldn't open after she applied them.\n \nUnfortunately I didn't listen to intuition, and allowed her to apply them from her poorly lit room in a very modest strip mall location. The application itself actually hurt as the glue began drying, and within several days (they were supposed to last weeks according to her), they began coming off in painful chunks. I had to remove the rest because I looked like a childs' baby doll whose lashes had been randomly pulled out.  What's really depressing I can see that my own lashes are now much much shorter and sparser than what they were and my eyelids are swollen and burning. \n\n I am kicking myself that I chose to do this in the first place, I did have truly nice lashes but just wanted a little extra for a special event, and I am mad at myself that I didn't research this business prior, and foolishly never asked her what her qualifications and experience was in applying these drugstore lashes. I doubt i have any recourse with this business, and I certainly wouldn't want her to attempt to re-do them, so I suggest you guard the precious lashes you do have and do your homework to find someone who is well-qualified to do proper lash extensions."
0,this place has teenagers running the place! Customer service is horrible! You are often greeted with attitude and a 15 min way on drive through with no car in front of you
1,The flavors of France are abundant here!!!!\nI take all my visitors here because the have a great variety of flavors and the cafe latte is the best I have found in town!!!. \nI always get a bowl and half way thru the breakfast all the tables surrounding me have joined in! I lived in Seattle for a long time and I finally found the place to rivalry old steady. Great setting with an Atrium to view the strip while you receive awesome service and they also have am outdoor heated patio that is quite comfortable most of the year!\nThis is one place you won't want to miss!  The locals love it too!
0,"Of all the restaurants we tried at MGM, Fiamma was the most disappointing, by far. The service was slow, inattentive, and all but ignored my multiple requests to clear an extra place setting from the small table to get some more room.\n\nThe food was the most disappointing, however, especially considering the price. The octopus tasted like it was well past it's sell-by date, and the pasta tasted frozen. Sauces were bland\n\nOverall, a \""ho-hum\"" experience for the taste buds"
1,"If you want good pizza, you can get it in just about any good sized American city. If you want the best pizza though, you have to go to the source, Naples. Naples Italy is where pizza evolved from a barely recognizable fisherman's meals of warm flat bread seasoned with olive oil and sardines, to what we've all come to recognize as contemporary pizza. A trip to Italy for a pizza may not be in everybody's budget though. \n\nFortunately, you don't have to go to Naples for authentic Naples pizza. If you live in Las Vegas, you can go to Settebello's.\n\nSettebellos is one of only 12 American pizzerias certified by the Verace Pizza Napoletana, an organization dedicated to the preservation authenticate Naples pizza by establishing rigid guidelines for preparation and ingredients, some of which seem to border on the ridiculous.\n\nThe dough can contain only four ingredients, flour, natural yeast, yeast of beer and water. The dough can only be worked with the hands, no rolling pins or machines allowed. The sauce has to be made from Italian grown tomatoes and the cheese can only be fresh buffalo mozzarella. The oven has to made from bricks imported from Italy and heated with a fire fueled only by wood.\n\nIs the result of all these harsh restrictions noting more than artifact and pretense? Is the end product an overpriced and mediocre discus of high falooting namby pandery?\n\nI SAY THEE NAY!\n\nSettebello's is the best pizza I've eaten within the borders of this nation, and the closest I've had to the pizza I had in Naples. The use of fresh ingredients and the dearth of artificial flavor enhancers and preservatives leaves the pizza with a crisp and bright flavor without the bitter acidity of cheap canned tomatoes. The dough has a smokey crunch that you can only get from a wood fired brick oven and the chewy mouth feel that requires manual kneading to develop gluten.\n\nDespite this attention to detail and lack of compromise on premium ingredients, Settebello won't put a hole in your wallet. A pizza will run you between $9 and $12 and while that's more expensive than Pizza Hut or Little Caesar's, if that's what you were looking for, you wouldn't be reading this. If you live in the Las Vegas area, or are just visiting, do yourself a favor and take a detour down to Henderson and give Settebello's a try. If you like pizza, you won't regret it."
1,"Mix is my favorite spot in Vegas. Mix restaurant has a great atmosphere but the food is just ok for the price. (Crab salad excellent; fliet decent). Mix lounge is a great place to hangout. The view (top of the south end of the Strip looking north) is the best on or off the strip. I had assumed that the Luxor would block its view but that's totally not the case. There's an outdoor section divided up between general balcony and bottle service. I recommend the bottle service, not as pricey as a real club and more breathing room. And the waitresses are more attentive than other places. Not that the rest of the lounge is super crowded."
0,"OK food but nasty attitude from owner. As I was paying my bill I casually suggested they add Wi-Fi. The owner glared at me and said \""Why? Just so customers will sit around all day and never turn over the tables?\"" Sorry, Cracked Egg, there are hundreds of places in Vegas where I can get a good breakfast without the attitude (and with Wi-Fi!)."
0,"Anyone who eats at TJ's Homestyle Restaurant is taking their life into their own hands!  Seriously, We sat at the counter and I have NEVER seen such a disgusting display of unsafe food handling.  There was one waitress working that was not sick all of the rest were and non bothered to wash their hands after coughing into them, or touching dirty rags, or running their hands through their greasy hair.  Our waitress took our orders then ignored us, fortunately the gal not coughing on herself was the one that realized our food was sitting there getting old.  The 2 people seated and served after us had already gotten their food and left the restaurant before we got our food.  Prices were cheap, but in this case you really do get what you paid for.  Definately not worth the wait for a seat.  NOT worth your time!"
1,"I've been meaning to write this for a while, but it's felt like such a chore! \n\nThis location is great. Clean everything, friendly staff, never crowded. The wait for food is never more than 5-10 minutes.\n\nNow, the food. These are arguably some of the best fish tacos to be had. I really like that they've expanded their side offerings (pick 2: black or pinto beans, chips, rice). Not a fan of the rice, but the beans are always tasty. The salsas are all delish. I get a burrito every once in a while, which have all been great. \n\nI just wish there was more food. The two taco plate just doesn't fill me up! A third taco would fix that problem, but adding more items to your order makes it go up in price exponentially. If I'm already paying $7 for my combo, I'm disinclined to buy another taco/burrito/some other food item for $3+\n\nGreat food, great service, portions leave something to be desired."
0,"Update: After writing this review, I decided to contact customer relations at the hotel again. I spoke with a very nice representative \""Lisa\"" who credited back $150 on my credit card-even she couldn't believe all of the notes on our account nor the fumes we had to deal with. They are also looking into other things for us so I am glad I called. \nUpgrading to 2.5 stars and this review might go higher depending on what else happens.\n_____________________________\nI had high expectations for this hotel-and even higher given the fact that we upgraded to a fancy pants suite to celebrate my 40th birthday. While the hotel lobby is beautiful and the poker room giant, the rest of our stay was just okay and I promise to post pictures of our room once I get around to it. We had some really nice service and some not so nice service given what happened here, and I will do my best to outline it.\n\n-Check in time is supposed to be 4pm. Our plane was late and we arrived at 6pm to find out our suite (that had been booked since mid September) was not ready for us. We were offered a lesser suite on a lower floor, but it was a smoking floor so that was a \""NO\"". We were then told they would have our kind of suite available in an hour so for inconvenience, we were offered free drinks at the bar (husband does not imbibe) and $100 food and beverage credit (not to include tips). We said that would be fine, brought our bags to the Valet area and went to look around a bit. As promised, an hour later, our room was ready and we had a suite on the 26th floor-all the way at the end of one hall.\n\nUpon walking into our suite, we were blasted by the smell of what I thought was new paint. When the Bellman brought up our luggage, he advised us that this was a newly remodeled suite and that we were the first ones to stay in it. This is usually a good thing, but the smell was so overpowering I felt dizzy and like I would pass out. I called down to the front desk, was on hold for about 15 minutes (word to the wise-if a major rodeo is in town beware for lots of cowboys and no room availability). I was told the hotel was at capacity (7,000 rooms) and they would send housekeeping up to refresh the room with air freshener. Luckily, we didn't stay in the room that long and we did have a bedroom door that shut and we couldn't smell the fumes with the door closed. \n\nThe next morning, I woke up with a bit of a headache and at about 6:45am, I told the husband I was going to get coffee from Bouchon. First, I made a beeline for the front desk.\n-I let the front desk know about our room smell. Again, I was advised the hotel was at capacity and was credited another $50 towards food and beverage. I was told that they could have housekeeping come and ionize our room but it would be a 5 hour or so affair. I told them that was fine as we had planned on going to Caesar's for the day and would call when we were leaving the room. I also advised that the jets in our tub were not working properly, there were lightbulbs burned out in the light fixture over the dining room table and that the makeup mirror provided did not work. I was assured everything would be taken care of.\n- We were gone all day. Left the Venetian around 9:30 and arrived back around 3:30 with a full expectation our room would be better. When we returned, the ionizer was still going full blast and whilst the bed had been made and the towels and ammenaties replenished, the bathroom was still not cleaned, lightbulbs still not replaced, etc. etc. I called down to the front desk and was on hold for about 20 minutes and was finally connected to a \""manager\"". At this point, we were running short on time as we had dinner plans with a couple of my friends and my Mom and her friend before we had tickets to see Jersey Boys. I was advised by this manager that they were at full capacity but they could have another comparable suite available to us but we would have to pack up and be ready to go by a certain time. I reminded him that we were on our way out the door to dinner-meeting people BEFORE our showtime. He was an ass-and I ended up telling him so and we left for dinner and I tried to suck up how furious I was about the room and the smell. Luckily both dinner and the show were enough to take my mind off the room and I did get a call during dinner on my cell from the asshole manager telling me that someone was coming to repair our tub, thoroughly clean the bathroom and that the ENTIRE hotel was out of the particular lightbulb to replace above the dining room table. Hard to believe, but by this point, I was done.\n\nThere are other problems with this hotel but there are also some great things. The front desk clerks were awfully nice, the hoochie mama dresses worn by most guests made for great people watching and the overall aesthetics of the hotel are magnificent. I enjoyed the restaurants, the window shopping, etc.\n\nI may stay here again, but probably not and definitely wouldn't waste our money on a suite here again."
0,"I did know what I was getting into when I stopped at the new Tilted Kilt in Matthews. I had heard they have decent food and wanted to give it a try, so we stopped in during their first couple weeks in business.\n\nWe went on a weekend night and, as to be expected, it was packed. Other reviewers have described the concept well enough that I will not rehash the descriptions (and I'll keep my mildly feminist opinions to myself). On this visit, maybe due to the crowd, maybe do to whatever game was on, it was loud. Very loud. For me, that is many times a turn off.\n\nOur server arrived and took our drink orders. I was disappointed in the beer menu. Guinness, Harp, Budweiser, Miller, etc etc...a few craft and NC brews, but they seem to focus on the cliched name-recognition UK imports (and no Scottish beers...where's the BrewDog?) and the standard NASCAR offerings. Blech.\n\nThe food, however, did live up to its reputation. They do have one of the better burgers in Matthews and the garlic fries were a nice touch. The meat was moist and flavorful and the other toppings fresh and cut to a reasonable size.\n\nThe girls who work here (with the exception of the cook, bartender, and manager, it seemed to be an all-female staff - no surprise there) were very attentive and seemed to have a grasp on the menu. I was confused, though, when our server changed half-way through for no apparent reason and with no explanation.\n\nAs I said, the food is good. The bar, concept, and ambiance, not so much. Maybe I'll log this one as \""take out only\"" for the future."
0,"Just stopped in for lunch and ordered the grilled mahi, but received the fried version. I specifically asked to substitute the brown rice for white rice, which the grilled comes with, but she didn't clarify. At first she was nice, but after their gaffe, her demeanor turned and she didn't even give me utensils or napkins until I asked repeatedly. To make it worse, she went to the kitchen, and the guy ended up giving me the fried fish even though he said it was grilled, which it clearly wasn't. :("
1,"It's a pretty hole in the wall at the Tempe Marketplace.  I wish they'd be a little more consistent with their flavor selection.  Sometimes you feel like a mint and sometimes you do but they don't have it on that particular visit, meh.\n\nI digress from my 4-star rating.  The yogurts good, the topping selection is better, and more consistent, and the staff is as friendly as can be.\n\nOnly thing I'd change is its location in front of the child trap water pit where it seems like every time I visit, there's a toddler running around sans a diaper."
1,"This is the place to go for all your vitamin, supplement & nutritional needs!  Tim and his wife (owners) are friendly, educated and not too pushy.  I initially found Apple Wellness via Groupon, but over a year later still go back for all my vitamins, protein powders and anything in between.  Tim took the time to get to know me, my daily habits and my issues before working on a package for me.  Now he recognizes me every single time I walk in and recommends new products, less expensive ones and has even noted products I could do away with because of other products purchased.  He truly loves what he does and is there to serve you.  Great business, great products and the best service!!  \n\n**I even moved to Milwaukee in the last year and still drive back to visit Apple Wellness!"
1,"A great little Irish beer with fabulous pub food and awesome drinks!! Quite an extensive selection of whiskeys and import beers alone! I`m usually not a big beer drinker but I did try a dirty black and tan ( half Guinness and half Irish cider), hello delicious!! \nI have been here three times so far to indulge with my friends, group trivia, and its always a great time!! Superb and friendly staff! Plus the gal who reads out the trivia questions has quite a thick Irish brogue, quite enjoyable! Great atmosphere!"
1,"Came in here three times during a week long trip because they are a devoted football (soccer) bar.  I was very excited to see multiple Spurs fans in attendance, although losing 4 to nil stung a bit.  \n\nOn a more serious note, this is a very good bar.   The only food I had was a delicious and gargantuan boxty that was easily sharable between fifteen people.  All three bartenders that served me were very cool, quick, and knowledgeable about the draft beers.  My only complaint was that they had no Power's whiskey."
0,"It's Las Vegas, can't expect too much.  They have your most typical dim sum.  Sweet tofu was the best."
1,"This was some good solid breakfast! I wouldn't say that anything in particular blew me out of the water (apart from maybe how cute the girls who work there are), but there wasn't a single thing wrong with any part of my meal.\n\nThe atmosphere was kinda typical breakfast joint look and feel. It has apparently very recently been redone, so everything is new and clean. Theres a pretty cool looking american flag made out of egg cartons on one of the walls, which I have to admit looked pretty awesome.\n\nI ordered the New York Omelet, which has chicken, spinach, tomatoes, and onions, I think, covered in your choice of hollandaise or cajun sauce. I knew i wanted the hollandaise, but I was kinda curious about what this cajun sauce was too, and I think the server could tell I was conflicted so she brought be both on the side! The cajun sauce really tasted more like a creamy chili, actually. It was good, just not what I wanted on the omelet, so I slathered on the hollandaise and got to eating. There is an english muffin and a side of hash browns as well.\n\nThe omelet was quite delicious, though I would say the chicken was a little on the dry side--not terribly so but enough to notice it. The hash browns were really well cooked and not at all greasy. I also ordered a tall glass of OJ, and was very glad to have fresh squeezed arrive at my table.\n\nThe servers are very friendly, willing to have a laugh, and kinda spunky considering the early hour; they help to get your morning started off right. And did I mention theyre good looking too? Ok, lets just be honest: theyre freakin hot. Ok? If you like good breakfast being served by hot, spunky, friendly waitresses, get it as US Egg."
1,We are here to have a bite to eat the lane to sit down is about fifteen minutes.  The coffee was good and our waitress was very nice and the chicken and waffles a must-have
1,"There is a new item on the menu, a table side made guacamole. At first we didn't really know what it meant so we ordered it out of curiosity. The waiter came out with whole avocados in a muddling stone and mashed them there on the spot. He asked what we would like added, the list was tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os, cilantro and lemon juice. It was really delicious and a fun experience getting table side serves at such a casual setting."
1,"Still a fan, just need to put it out there that the dancing dragon roll is not so great :( BUT I still love Little Asia."
1,Was an amazing breakfast and great service- awesome little hidden gem- had the country fried steak and want seconds!
1,"Delicious green tea latte and tea mulled apple cider. Cozy atmosphere, generally quiet, would recommend for reading or studying and enjoying good tea."
1,"My neighborhood just keeps getting better and better, and I'm grateful that the extremely kind, attentive staff at Teppanyaki Kyoto is part of that. My friend and I really enjoyed our dinner.\n\nWe shared some miso fried chicken (tasty!). I had a Hiroshima pancake--one of the more memorable dishes of my life--and she had a more noodley entr\u00e9e. Both were great. I think the prices are fair. I'll be back!"
1,"My fianc\u00e9 and I dined at Mercadito not long after it's opening so I went in under the assumption that there would be some kinks that would need to be worked out, but that was definitely not the case. The staff was super friendly and our busser was very attentive. \n\nThe food was excellent (definitely try the guac with bacon... Mmmmmm bacon....). Enchiladas were hot and flavorful. Cocktails were great and the chocolate cake lava dessert? Fantastic! I'll be back!"
0,"With all the gazillion Japanese restaurants to choose from here in Vegas, this one isn't the cream of the crop.  I got the bento box with shrimp tempura (2 pieces?!) and rubbery beef teriyaki.  I think the only semi-redeeming thing is the Volcano Roll which was mediocre at best.  I don't think I'll come back anytime in the near future."
0,"I have had 2 experiences with this place. The first time was when I brought my 1974 Corvette in for an oil change. The filter they used was missing the oil sealing ring and when I started the car, my oil was left laying on the ground. The second and final experience was when I brought my daughters Chevy Malibu in for service. They wound up putting the wrong coolant in the radiator which they couldn't (wouldn't) properly repair and I wound up having to get rid of the car. Would never go there again and I tell everyone I know to beware!"
0,"Husband and I on a return trip to Vegas revisited here. So disappointed, arrived for food, found our own seat and waited to be served. We intended to get drinks and food. Ordered coke and a spirit which arrived after having to discuss the happy hour deal to ensure it was clear to the waitress what we wanted and wanted to pay. We were never offered the food menu, left sitting for a long time waiting on the waitress to come back to us. One of our drinks was a coke which was disgusting, tasted like mold. Tried to pay for our drinks at the bar but had to wait for the waitress to return 10 minutes later. \n\nAs an Irish person the only authentic Irish thing I can see about this place is the high prices in comparison to other similar businesses and attitude of the particular waitress. There are plenty of other great places to have the \""craic\""."
0,"I wonder what happened here...I guess when the name changes then all else goes 180\n\nSee, I remembered when this place was called Rah and things were still \""right\"" as in everybody said \""excuse me\"" if they accidentally bump to you (not intentional like what most douchebags think is the way to pick up women...geez, I thought we were in a club not the gorilla chamber at the zoo) and the smell of rotten banana daiquiri didn't go under your nose from 4 feet across of where he's standing & yelling out to dance with him\n\nDrink plenty of vodka, gin, rum, whatever to make sure you forget that you danced with Rico \""Suave\"" who had 2 left feet & a sport jacket doused with aramis cologne"
1,"Great service! Kimberly, our server, was prompt with our orders, she was very polite and courtious. The manager stopped by and checked on us twice. Everything tasted amazing. This was my boyfriends first time here and he was very impressed. Price was not bad at all!"
1,"Great flavored food, quick service, gluten free soy sauce available. Will be back!"
1,"This is a review for the hotel's entertainment offering rather than the hotel rooms... I've never stayed here but definitely enjoyed visiting!\n\nFor the kids (loved it when I was little): an awesome arcade where you can win prizes and a crazy \""climb the ladder\"" game where you can win a huge stuffed animal or fall *splat* onto a big bouncy cushion.\n\nFor the young adults: The fun club, Orange (I think is the name?), with a great dj, strong drinks, and a cool outdoor area.\n\nFor the older family: The crazy \""Senior Frogs\""-style bar where you can watch the bartender swirl tequila bottles followed by free shots for all... (also a good pre-game for the club)\n\nFor everyone: The outdoor pirate show!"
0,"First and foremost, I should tell you I'm giving them 1 star simply because I can't give them 0 stars.\n\nI booked a room for 3 days during EDC weekend- had an early flight so I called a few days before(Thursday) to see if they allowed early check-in, was told absolutely. We arrived 8:30/9:00am to find that their system had been down since Tuesday and they couldn't check-in until 3:00. Shouldn't I have been told that when I called on Thursday? After walking the strip in 100 degree heat all morning, I went back to Aria around 1:00 to see if anything had changed- it hadn't. I hung out in the lobby until 3:00 only to find that check-in had been pushed to 5:00 because the computer system wasn't back up. Tell me this- what did we do before computers? \nCurrently, there are 500+ people in the lobby waiting to check-in(the line wraps around the building). And what's being done? Absolutely nothing. \n\nWay to go Aria- we paid a premium price for a premium experience and what do we get? A day of vacation absolutely wasted."
0,"The restaurant looks inviting, and like a good time. However, the two pizzas i've eaten there have been rather subpar, and the service has been some of the worst in the city. Both times i've been there we waited 15 minutes until someone came to our table. That's about what can sum up this place. Others may enjoy, because it brings one of the few more upscale restaurants to oakland, but it still just does not do it for me."
1,"Ordered the pad Thai and pad se ewe, level 4.  Both were good with perfect spice level for us. Would order the pad se ewe again. For a neighborhood Thai place, it is great."
1,Amazing! Cool concept. You choose your ingredients and then to the oven! Fast and good. Been here two times and will keep coming back.
1,"The shopping mall that this place is in is seriously scary.  I nearly forgot that I was in the United States and not some war ravished country.  \n\nYou really can't beat the bang for the buck here.  The sandwiches are dirt cheap and high quality.  Do I think it's the best sandwich in town?  No, definitely not.  Is it high quality, tasty, and great bang for the buck?  Absolutely!  \n\nLe's is worth giving a try."
1,"This place carries everything!  From books, to dvds, to RPGs, and action figures, posters, purses, jewelry, little trinkets.  I love to shop here.  I just recently came here with my pup, and was waiting outside for a friend.  Then the lady working there tells me that they are pet friendly!!! Whaaaaa???  Do you know how many places that I cannot go to because of my furry friend?  So, I thought they were awesome before. Now I think they are AMAZING!"
1,"While the red velvet pancakes were really good, I personally liked the Cinnabon-like pancakes a bit better. Try the Portuguese sausage (with a little kick to boot!) as well. Pefect and delicious contrast to the sweet 'cakes"
1,"I was lucky enough to go here on one of my loading days for the diet I was doing, which means I could eat anything I wanted without guilt. I had the beautiful 4 Peaks French Toast, which was absolutely tasty.\n\nThe decor of the place is your standard country kitchen with the roosters and the eggs and old kitchen appliances for decor.  Very bright though. There is definitely no darkness in there.\n\nThe best part... you can bring 10 friends with you and sit at one of these gimongus tables... and it will fit you all comfortably.  Even if there are only 2 of you, they will sit you at these tables.\n\nTo me, those huge tables are brilliant.  Go to other breakfast places and they are always so backed up because of the large parties going out to breakfast and this just solves the whole problem.  Good for them. :)"
0,"Venue is alright, nothing special compared to the other venues around. The only decent aspect about it is the open bar policy for girls."
1,love this place for speedy filling food. Even if you are not a sushi lover they offer a variety of soups ( that are refillable for free) and rice dishes.
0,"While waiting for a delayed flight I ordered tomato soup with tortellini (ONE tortellini). It was pitiful. So I ordered the pastrami sandwich which was so rancid I managed to choke down less than half before my body rejected it and I threw it up. Oh, also, when I got my bill it was $20 over. The bar dude was totally unrepentant. He corrected it without apology. DO. NOT. EAT. HERE."
1,L'une de plus belle et compl\u00e8te SAQ du r\u00e9seau. Deux \u00e9tages bien remplies et un personnel serviable et sympathique.
0,"LOL\nThis place is a joke, and I have come to terms with Vegas and its lifestyle, you know? a bunch of security guards high off their own, you know where I'm going with this, living in Vegas has taught me one thing, patience, but after what I witnessed last night... I could not believe I try new clubs at all.\nHere goes last night:\n\nTook my mom to the airport, went to Planet Hollywood, walked around a bit, got approached by this promoter, said yes, friend arrived, we headed to the club. I have no problem waiting in line, but, this had become far more than that, there was a group of 4 people in line in front of us, we shared a couple smiles at jokes and we were all waiting patiently, then we see a couple females that just walked in talk to the person manning the line, then lo and behold, the security asks us to step back, and allow them to come in front and wait. \n\nAgain, why do I venture away from XS, Tao, Hyde, Lax, Lavo or Blue Martini, and my little hole in the wall hangouts? to see crap like this? \n\nAll these clubs are lacking customer service- I looked at the group and said that was disrespectful, and they agreed, they walked away, and then we left as well.\n\nDoes this club know the story of how Hakkasan came about?\n\nHAKKASAN LAS VEGAS REVENGE STORY: HOW A MIDDLE EASTERN BILLIONAIRE DISRESPECTED BY A VEGAS NIGHTCLUB BANKROLLED THE $200 MILLION CLUB TO TEACH THEM A LESSON\n\nlol, I'm not saying that it will be me, I'm saying, respect the people who support your cause.\n\n---ended up checking out Koi, which isn't spectacular, but the girls controlling the line were very attentive, explained what was happening, ensured that they would be right with us, even tried selling products in a non pushy way... didn't love the space, but loved the music and the service."
1,"A 5 star gem!\n\nI echo Jenny D's comment on the hash brown. Super crispy exterior and moist fluffy inside - it's a piece of art.  My friend and I enjoyed the generous portion of scramble egg ($7.50), and 2 layers blueberry pancake ($5.00). Everything tasted like \""mom's food.\"" Made fresh to order, and very satisfying. \n\nNo frou-frou typical Middleton gimmick. The basic decore, and the down to earth service - the perfect spot to watch regulars enjoy the hearty breakfast."
0,"We went to BJ's every once in a while because it was close and the food was decent. \n\nHowever recently service quality has seriously slipped. The waitress was cocky (not in a funny way - rather in an obnoxious way). \nThe beer took forever. I mean they have beer on tap why does it take like 20 minutes to get one even though the store was barely half-full? \nThe food is ok, but not great. A little overpriced too. \n\nProbably not going here again any time soon. They need to up their game."
0,Went there for 2 problem the main problem was fixed but costly. Second problem said a/c composer need to be replaced 1200 dollars so had second opinion was actually the fan 165 dollars.   Nice that they checked for the real problem never going back there.
0,Well I can't really comment on their food or their service.\n\nWe decided to order from them one evening but the guy told us it would take over an hour and he sounded like we were really inconveniencing him. So we told him to forget about it.\n\nI don't mind waiting over an hour but I'd like a little courtesy over the phone.
0,"Shrimp and Grits were good.    (I'm from Louisiana,  so it may be an A+ for people not from the south).   We also had the blackened fish sandwich,  baked beans and chopped salad.  All of these items were awesome.   Why 2 stars?  Snotty and very abrupt young hostess.  Says 25 min wait for some and permits immediate seating for others who have no reservation.  Also,  the service did not match the good food.   These things matter."
1,"I needed pizza and not big-box pizza.  I wanted a real pizza experience.  I knew Chizona's is where I could get it.\n\nI try to go here for lunch as often as I can.  This last trip, I had the \""Big Slice & Salad\"" combo.  The subject slice is a quarter of an entire pizza!  It comes with one topping and I went with the standby, pepperoni.  It's a thinner crust pizza, usually sliced across several times to make a slice so large, manageable to eat.  This last time, I had requested the slice remain uncut.  I wanted to pick up the whole thing and eat it that way.  It's a thinner crust pizza.  As the crust goes out from the center it gets crisper, the edge being near-crackery.  With pepperoni grease dripping & the smell of the oregano I shook on top permeating as I took-bite-after-bite, it was the pizza experience I had been craving.\n\nThe salad is a generous mix of romaine, tomatoes, the vegetables associated with pizza and lots of shredded mozzarella.  Delicious.  I had it with their Italian dressing but sometimes I get their Ranch.  It's the mix kind that is 10 times better then the crap in the bottle.\n\nI've had sandwiches, gyros, chicago-style hot dogs and their incredible, fresh-made, fries on past visits and everything has been excellent.\n\nThe only thing keeping this from being 5 star is the drink selection.  Now, if you like soda, it's OK.  There is no fountain.  Sodas come in cans (that come w/combos, btw).  I'm not so keen on that.  There's no brewed iced tea and no beer.\n\nDespite my not giving this place 5 stars, Chizona's is one of my favorite places to eat."
1,"1. The staff is very personable. Ken, Ro and Cat always make me feel like a regular. It's nice when you just aren't another body and they wanna get you in and out.\n\n2. It's never packed and I really LOVE that! You can actually hear someone talk, have good conversation, not feel rushed, relax and enjoy yourself.\n\n3. The food is good. I always order the veg tempura with a side of spicy mayo, the golden avocado or the orange chicken. \n\n4. It's a good place to go if you are solo. Sit at the bar, they have multiple tvs and the fights are usually on.\n\n5. It's kid friendly!"
0,"Some how my review got deleted!!  Probably some of the most awful/over priced sushi I've ever eaten!! I am a crazy sushi lover!! I just moved to Arizona from LA, ca and I've been checking out different sushi joints....trying to find the best one in AZ. This place was crazy over priced for the crap food they gave us! My husband got salmon and I got a few rolls. The food quality was AWFUL! The service sucked! I don't mind paying $100 for a few sushi rolls, soup, and some salmon, but it better be good! Sadly it was not, the rolls were small and very thin...the rice was hard! This was the first time in my whole 22 years of eating sushi that I've ever experienced hard rice on a sushi roll!! On a better note, the salmon and soup was pretty good! I will NEVER return to this place......"
1,"I found this salon back in the beginning of the year during a break between classes one day.  Scrolling through Yelp reviews, I wasn't feeling too hopeful until I stumbled across their listing. Good reviews, nice pictures, why not give them a try?\n\nWow!!\n\nSuper clean, great massage chairs, greeted right away. I am always offered something to drink, asked if the water is warm enough; customer service gets an A+.  I got a pedicure and was really pleased with the results.\n\nSince then I have been back almost every two to three weeks.  Tiffany does the most amazing nail art (of which I wasn't a fan of in general, but her designs and color work are so beautiful that I have spread my wings and tried out some new looks.  She does the most gorgeous hand sculpted roses).  I have had pedicures done by Tiffany, Nancy, and her dad.  Everyone there is meticulous in their work, with the polish on the pedicures lasting for weeks!  I get the gel manicure and my nails are long and healthy.\n\nI normally get the VIP pedicure with the paraffin, hot stone, massage, and sugar scrub.  My legs and feet are so very happy after my time here!  \n\nI live over in Glendale, so they are about 45 minutes away from me and completely worth the drive.  I've been to many salons in the Phoenix metro area over the years and Marvel wins hands down!"
0,"Ate here, nice joint, low key place to just chill and hang out....but the food wasnt very good. Most of the dishes we ordered were not very tasty.\n\nSpice level was high--but other flavors were lacking."
1,Well not much to update here it's still damn good and it's only been 5 days since last visit.  \n\nToday I had:\nPulled Pork Sandwich with Southwest Slaw and mustard bbq sauce.  It was amazing the slaw alone was outstanding but then pile it on top of a mound of smoked pork goodness and top it all off with tangy sweet sauce and you got yourself a winner.  \n\nI also had a side of bacon mac and cheese obviously it is a must and it was just as amazing as last week.  \n\nBest thing is he is going to be by my job in two days with fresh brisket : ) I can't wait.
1,"We decided to take our 17 yr old son and five of his friends and parents there, after a hockey tournament game. These boys were starving! The place was immaculate. Food was delicious, although the service was a bit slow. It took quite a while for the food to come out and I thought those boys were going to start guzzling the tabasco!  My husband ordered the chicken fried steak and it was pretty tough and had ribbons of grissle. The chorizo in my meal was bland but those boys loved their meals. One said the chicken fingers were the best he's ever had! We will go back."
0,"If i could give this no stars i would.  I had no chance to actually eat the food so this review is based completely on how my experience was with this company and the owner. \n\nAccording to their website :  http://www.vegascheesesteaks.com/Menu.aspx\n\nMinimum Delivery Amount\nThe minimum order amount for delivery is $15.\n\nDelivery Area\nWe deliver within 5 miles.\n\nDelivery Charge\nFor any delivery additional $2 as delivery charge.\n\nSooo  you would think that would deliver within a 5 mile radius right ?\n\nWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGG\n\n\nThey don't deliver.  The funny thing is why the heck would you have your website set up this way and allow the order to be delivered but not honor this... make any sense ??? \n\nPLUS ON TOP OF THAT !!!!

They should have called me right then and there and said were sorry we dont deliver and we would have gone to pick it up... but NOOOO instead We waited 45 minutes ( they say on their site expect 30 to 45 minute wait depends on time of day ) then i called to find out the status and was notified they needed to caller the owner and he would call me back..... \n\nOwner calls me and gives me excuse after excuse as to why they cant \\ dont deliver and doesnt even offer me a discount just basically tells me sorry for waiting for 45 minutes all we will do is give you a refund. \n\n\nI will not be going here because they are false advertising the fact they deliver and cannot accept plain excuses from an owner who obviously has no idea what they are doing.\n\nSo now im out 45 minutes of my personal time , i could easily be enjoying some hot enjoyable cheesesteaks but now i never will and will tell every one i know to stay away from here.  \n\nThe owner and this company does not deserve to be in business. \n\nPLAIN AND SIMPLE.\n\nP.S.

1,"Omg I cane here yard ago when I was just visiting and finally came back.....it still taste the same....delicious! There is such a wide selection and ways that you can have your desert. The crepes are rolled up like a ice cream cone and fresh fruit ice or yogurt and whip cream can be added. They also have waffles that they dress like a funnel cake. I have tries the crepe with all the different berries and the bananas foster, both were amazing! The crepe is not sweet but just the right  flavor for a sweet treat. First choice when I am craving something sweet!!"
0,"It used to be great. We came in before the dinner rush for a family dinner for 8. Sat in the very sticky (seriously my shoes are still sticking to everything) bar area and ordered some drinks and apps before moving to our table. Garlic Fries and Flatbread were good, but drink menu was limited because they were out of mint and 1/3 of their cocktail menu uses mint. \n\nOne big thing that I couldn't help but notice when I walked up the stairs are all of the bins full of water surrounding the hostess podium, look up and there's major leaks coming from the ceiling...um, okay? We're not talking a waterfall, but definitely a steady stream of water pouring through different areas of the ceiling. No acknowledgment even when it was mentioned.\n\nSo we sit down and place our orders. I've been before and do credit the selection. It's 6:30 now on Thursday night and we are the only table. Based on the food, I can see why. Chicken sandwich was inedible. The chicken was stringy and old like the bacon, looked like it was reheated in microwave. The taste? There really wasn't much taste, just salty. The shredded lettuce was subpar to even Applebee's and the roll didn't help either. I filled up on garlic fries and after we paid and I ventured straight over to Silvermine for a real dinner.  The rest of my inlaws were mixed on their reviews of dishes (lobster Mac - okay, fish and chips - pretty good, steak tacos - no).\n\nOverall, this place used to be nice, but food quality and atmosphere have taken a major tumble. I wouldn't be surprised if this spot is called something else next year."
1,"Sushi is great - service is good and each time I have dined there with my toddler, they have been great.  They have a pretty good kid's dish that my kid enjoys as well.  The wine list leaves much to be desired (wine lovers have to \""settle\"" but it isn't horrible) but the sushi is WAY better than Ra for sure!"
0,"I really liked my dessert (the sable) it was definitely the highlight of the meal. In terms of the mains, my scallops arrived cold and over salted, and my boyfriend said his fois gras was just \""fine\"". The atmosphere was extremely loud (similar to a high school cafeteria) and it was interesting having my waiter shout the specials at me. Not at all what I would expect at a restaurant of this type but might be fun if you're a large group and not on a date."
1,"Hey, its nice.  Good food, good drinks, very cosy...and again, NO SMOKING...a perfect place.  Great for after work gatherings..."
1,"First visit here was last night with my parents (in from out of town). We originally went to Houston's and there was a 1hr wait... so we walked right across the parking lot, and were seated immediately at Veneto Trattoria (it was busy, just not packed).\n\nOne of the best Italian restaurants I have ever visited. I love that this is right in my neighborhood too! The prices are very reasonable, the food is delicious, and the service impeccable. \n\nI enjoyed the pork chop, while my guests tried seafood, pasta, and salads. Everyone was very pleased with the experience.\n\nPlan on making this a regular stop."
0,"Umm, I thought a spa in Vegas would be the best, especially at the Venetian... but I was sadly mistaken. The facility was not all that, very small and not very quiet in the \""quiet room\"". Robes were not plush and the pockets were sewn shut (what's up with that???) And the slippers hurt my feet. Burke Williams totally kicks Canyon Ranch's butt! Massage was ok but pretty pricey at $150 for their most basic massage. All in all, I would have rather gambled the $150 while sitting at a slot machine to get my \""quiet\"" time."
1,"This beats out Greek Pita (which is right up the street) any day of the week. The gyro meat is flavorful and not dry, the spinach pie is flaky and delicious, and the baklava is AWESOME. The family who owns it are so friendly and nice, it's a pleasure every time we go there. My only regret is that they had been there almost 2 years before I went! Love it!"
1,This is the place to stay great hostess KIM the best. If you like the slots they have them all i even play the tables and i never do any at any other casino. Also they have a movie theatre and im a movie buff so i love this. The food is great if you like good cusine THE 9STEAK HOUSE and NOVE ITALIANO. I cant wait to go back.
1,"Great food.  The reviews that mentioned spotty service did not apply to me.  I had great service from a friendly waiter.\n\nWe arrived early on a Friday night... I think at 6 pm.  No wait!!!  WTF?!  I guess it's a Tapas place, so people are coming later to get shitfaced.  Well, I was kinda right.  15 minutes later the place was packed.  We got lucky!\n\nThe servers came promptly and we mentioned to him that it was our first time.  We got a pitcher of red sangria to start off and when he came back we started ordering.  After we finished our first round he promptly came and we ordered a second round from him.  When we asked for suggestions, he was very friendly and patiently told us his favorites as well as popular items.\n\n+the red sangria was amazing.  It wans't watered down and it's been marinading for three days.  You can taste the sweetness of the fruits mixed with the wine.  It was the best sangria I've ever had.\n\n+Stuffed dates... as other Yelpers mentioned, this was great.  The waiter mentioned that this was one of the most popular dish.  The sweetness may have been a bit too much, but the almond was there to give it a bang at the end as well as another needed texture to go with the crisp bacon and the soft dates.\n\n+Crispy duck rolls:  These were one of my favorites.  Just make sure you eat it before it gets soggy haha.  The duck was grounded up, it was made basically like an egg roll.  The hoisin sauce they had with it made it great.\n\n+Something peppers.  Red peppers with the cheese.... wow.  I usually demand meat in my dishes, but this did not make me regret getting a meat free dish.\n\n+/-Fillet sliders... I guess this wans't anything special  I mean they could have used sirloin or chuck and it would've been fine.  Why grind up fillet which is already tender?\n\n+/-Paella was OK.  Nothing special.  A bit overpriced if anything, but you gotta have your paella with tapas\n\n+/-Smoked salmon toast.  The smoked salmon part was good.  The fact that the toast was not crispy at all ruined it.\n\nI had many other things that were great also.  But these were my favorites or the items I felt needed to be mentioned.  For 5 people including two pitchers of sangria (for $26/pitcher) the bill came out to be around $130 pretip.  I'll be going back!"
0,Odd in layout with an absolute lack of electrical outlets this is possibly the worst Panera in the Valley - all of the others varying in quality from good to excellent.  Apparently doubling as playground for children with irresponsible parents visiting the nearby mall it was almost intolerable to spend more than thirty minutes here and with a laggy internet further confounding the experience I'll just as soon head on over to the Eastern location when visiting the southeast from now on.
0,"My mom took me here this morning after I arrived on an early-morning flight, we had a craving for coffee and a new place. \nFirst impression: Small brick building by what looks like a roach motel and a parking lot totally full. Some really weird icky smell was in the air too..?\nInside is cramped with little orange tables, totally kitsch and cute. The staff were all very friendly and made sure our orders were taken as soon as we were ready, even to the point that different waitresses were asking to make sure we had coffee on the way.\nThe coffee's great and I was impressed with raw sugar on each table. \n\nThe menu is small [literally] and I ordered the cheese omelette [cheddar] with mushrooms and hash browns. The hash browns were ridiculously oily. They would have been tastier without so much grease. The omelette was mediocre and I could have made the same in my own kitchen.  The whole wheat toast was probably the best part of the meal, and the jam tasted homemade and flavourful. I am not used to really greasy food like I was served [nor did I expect it] and therefore could not get through half my breakfast before my stomach started aching. \n\nThe jist? Small cafe, great waitstaff, subpar diner food. Oh, and this might be good to know: there is no restroom in the place, so if you need to use one, you will have to go next door to that sketchy motel."
0,"I have no idea who the staff think they are. I was immediately discriminated before I even was seated, the host said 'Just go to the bar.' I tried explaining to him I did not want to sit at the bar, I am pregnant. Well he had the audacity to offend me even more by asking me why I was all by myself.. WHAT? I ended up being sat by another hostess, she was walking to quickly I lost track of where she had even gone. Well when I sat down, I was very irritated. Well to make it even worse my server approached me and said 'Go sit at the bar like a normal person, fatty.' I'm just going to say I will never go back. I do not think anybody should be disrespected just to eat food."
0,Located inside Miracle Mile this place offers friendly service and the beer comes to you quick...the beer however is not the best...I'd say try a different brewery
0,Have been to this place twice and the experience was the same. I personally don't get what draws people to this place. It's got a bit of a negative vibe. The staff is not friendly or service oriented and it's dirty. Great location for a light rail pub crawl - I think it just might not be our crowd.
1,"So I bought a Bluetooth a couple of days ago and my newly adopted Chihuahua chewed it up. I was so so sad, but when I brought it into Best Buy they let me exchange it under my warranty amazing!!! Thank you Maria at Best Buy!!!"
0,"This is just for the whole management of Cox Services in Las Vegas.\n\nCox is just like any oil company that pops in your head. Their monopolistic practices have made them the only acceptable cable/internet/phone provider in Clark County and they intend to do anything to bar out intruding services to compete with their digusting enlisted prices. I come from Los Angeles, where we get the same services that Cox provides for about half off. But the price is what makes the difference and Cox loves to suck the life out of you if they have to.\n\nBecause I spend a great deal of time online for multiple purposes, I need fast internet. To get that kind of service, I am forced to pay $50-55. JUST for internet. In Los Angeles,  you can get both cable AND internet for that price. Cox understands that they are the lone cable provider so they take advantage of this town.\n\nSad thing is, you really can't say no here unless you get Dish or Direct TV. If you do get those services, you must sign for a long term commitment which in truth, is technically cheaper in the long run.\n\nCox will never have lenience on your finances but it's not like you really have a choice. Even the customer representatives are hesitant when they say the prices over the phone because it makes even them throw up. I'm hoping that other services start making their way and once they do, Cox can go fuck themselves."
0,"Don't even waste your time, food quality poor, we had high hopes for this place but what a disappointment.  We took one bite and headed for the trash!  Pei Wei blows this place away.  The only good feedback I can give is the restaurant was clean..."
1,"O.M.G. portions were huge!!! Felt like I was eating in a buffet since the size of my plates were doubled. It was definitely a great experience and well worth your money. I ordered a sandwich with some seasoned potatoes and veggies. That thing was so big that I had to cut it into fourths. My friend also ordered a burger that she couldn't even scarf it down because it was that big. Overall, a great place to visit if you're hungry for some good appetite. Just remember that there will be leftovers on your way out."
0,The bagels are good. The sandwiches leave something to be desired in the taste department and the coffee is over roasted. Everything is a bit over-priced for what you get. I have never had a problem with the customer service.
1,"Love their 2 olive fougasse, love the yummy but oh so fattening blue cheese baguette, and I'm not even a fan of blue cheese! Their apricot/hazelnut bread is ever so good, but I do wish they'd shell the hazelnuts a bit more carefully! There is a very cozy caf\u00e9 upstairs where you can sit down & enjoy your soup/sandwich/pastry/tea/coffee. This is THE boulangerie I keep coming back to whenever I'm  in /near the Prince Arthur/Carr\u00e9 St.Louis area."
0,"The Carnegie Deli is located inside The Mirage Hotel. It operates as a vacuum for your wallet, and although the food is not bad, the price is not worth even one trip. \n\nThe cost of a sandwich would be about the same as being in New York City at Second Ave Deli. BTW, you can't order a smaller version of a sandwich for a cheaper price. And, if you split a sandwich (recommended) then yet another charge is added on top! When you add it all up, you will be disappointed if not mad at yourself afterwards. \n\nThe logical choice is to go somewhere else, which is easy to do in Las Vegas.  \n\nBest to all,"
0,"Disappointing, especially when compared to SLS in Miami or Los Angeles. Las Vegas hotel did not meet my expectations. I expected the decor to be unique, but it just freely \""thrown together\"" especially Cosmopolitan or Encore are other options. Maybe they're still trying to get the bugs out - since it's fairly new."
0,"NEVER EVER buy a gift for someone here.  They claim a hassle free return but if you dont have the original card the gift was purchased on, they will NOT allow you to return the item.  They will hassle you to death trying to keep the money hostage.  The receipt says \""no hassle return and you only need the proof of purchase and original packaging\"" but when you go to return an item, they will NOT allow you to get your cash back."
1,"I was at Dolce two times this weekend. First for my birthday I got an all over color and cut by Jessica and she did an amazing job. She knew exactly what color would work for me and she definitely delivered. I was also there today for an updo for my engagement photos today and I can't remember the girl's name- Sara maybe, but she did such a good job replicating the picture I showed her. It was a half up half down with volume and curls. Although I had an appointment in the morning my curls lasted the entire day! While I was getting my eye make up done at MAC I had 2 people compliment my hair as well. This is a complete 180 from the experience I had at the Scottsdale Quarter Drybar for my first round of engagement photos. They completely messed up my hair so I am extremely grateful for my awesome experience at Dolce. Thanks ladies!!! My birthday hair looked awesome and I'm sure my engagement pictures came out beautiful!"
1,Great service. Fresh menu choices. I had salad with seared tuna avocado grapefruit and watermelon!!  My favorite ingredients for a summer salad!
0,"I agree that \""not all Macys are created equal\"" because some are nicer than others with clean floors and attentive staff. That said, the Macys in Minnesota are good, but the ones in Las Vegas are not in the least. The phone customer service is horrible and I was sent defective merchandise twice in the mail. Macys, overall, has been going downhill for some time and I am no longer a customer after 30 years.  Nordstroms and Amazon have my business now."
1,"We love, love, love Jacs. We live down the street and go about once a week. The hosts and servers are always friendly, especially to our preschooler...jackpot! As vegetarians, we always find great menu choices--standouts are the walnut burger, the beet salad, and the sweet potato flatbread. Great local beers and fun, casual ambiance."
0,"Why Sammy, Why?  The service here is terrible.  I don't have any Van Halen delussions.  This place sure isn't Panama and it's more like Running with the Devil (Waitstaff).\n\nAvoid this place.  Hell, go to Wendy's next door.  At least you know full well the food will suck.  It'll be cheaper too."
0,"We stopped by here for a dessert after Fuddruckers and they were offering ice cream cupcakes. I thought it was going to be some elaborate way of creating a ice cream cupcake but they opened up a tupperware that had little ice cream scoops and just plopped it on a open cupcake top and filled it with cream on top to cover the ice cream. Umm, ok. What a cheap way to make a so-called \""ice cream cupcake'."
0,"I went to this shop based on the high ratings. \n12 days later, 2 loaner cars, $1200, many excuses, a second opinion that found the problem in minutes, and 3 chances later, the issue of new front struts and squeaking and rocking upon braking persist. The car has not felt remotely right since it was in their hands. Will go to second opinion Tobias in Cave Creek next time. They seem far more on top of things."
0,"This is a gloopy mess, steam table nastyness. Tattered decor, shoddy service. Save your money"
0,"This place has really gone downhill over the past few years. I've been going here for about 3 years (work in the area) and I've seen it go through many changes and it has changed owners and as the new owners continue to change things.\n\nFirst, smoking lounge is gone and they're now making way for the \""Blue Adobe Trading Post\"" where they will continue to sell the horribly tacky, garish, and overpriced rhinestone handbags, shirts, and belts that they've been selling at the bar section recently.\n\nIt also seems like they change out the furniture every two months or so. I don't get why they keep doing this, how they can afford to buy so much furniture, and what the reason for it is. The place is also kept a little too dark for what its trying to be.\n\nThe menu used to be pretty large, but is pretty overpriced for what they offer and for the place. They cut the menu down to a page or two a few weeks ago, but it is still overpriced."
1,"Lovely place in Las Vegas. Good option if, like me, you want to eat something else than american burgers. Hawaiian food is very good and this place is not expensive at all."
0,"I moved into this apartment complex a little over 2 months ago. It is a brand new complex and has many common amenities. It is situated on the border of Scottsdale and Paradise Valley. \n\nI am giving it 2 stars for the below unbiased reasons:\n\n1) Every unit has a built in fan in the bathroom that cannot ever be turned off. The fan runs 24/7 and flashes a green light. While some may not find it to be a big disturbance, I personally find it difficult to sleep well with the fan perpetually on without wearing earplugs. Broadstone Alliance has turned it on so that it can pursue Leed certification. (Leed certification can lead to tax savings for corporations). The manager claims it benefits tenants due to the constant clean air, you can be the judge. \n\n2) You can hear noise in hallways vividly. While noise insulation between units appears decent, because there is a slit under unit doors, if you are unfortunate to have neighbors who will speak loudly in the hallways and odd hours, it is audible. \n \n3) Apartments monthly rent can be for example $1299 for a studio, $1500+ for a 1bdrm and you must have renter's insurance. (keep in mind the area, this is not NYC)\n\n4) If you want to break the lease the manager has stated that it will be 2 months rent plus any incentives you received at lease signing. Apply that to the sample apartment rents.  $2600 and $3000+. I was not offered any negation room to break the lease.  \n\nIt is up to you to decide whether it is worth the price. At such high prices I would expect the corporation to have enough decency to leave the fan in the bathroom off for the benefit of it's occupants sense of calm and quiet and treat tenants with more understanding when people are uncomfortable and require lease breaks."
1,"On the outside (which is inside the Cosmopolitan), it resembles that of a truck/street vendor, but don't be fooled: Here lies a 2-in-1 deal so unique.\n\nTo the right is the Mexican food, to the left is the Chinese food. Your choice, choose wisely.  \n\nI decided to go with carb overload and steer towards the noodles.  Dan Dan Mian they're called: wheat noodles with spicy pork bits.  It was incredible. When it arrived, my first thought was \""This is freakin' tiny\"".  I thought I could eat five of them!  So yes, small portion...but wowww is it tasty.  \n\nAlso went with the salt and air margarita, which my bartender creatively added a touch of hibiscus tequila to it.  I give her props too, because she could give a Tequila lesson to anyone who could listen. The salt \""air\"" was a cloud of ecstasy.  Yum.\n\nSo yeah... a little expensive but unique dishes."
1,"Cute little breakfast spot. I had the Huevos Rancheros, which were delicious. Not smothered in enchilada sauce like most places. I was a little disappointed at first that it came with chips instead of tortillas, but the crunch was a nice addition. Even though you order up front then sit down (in which most places you never hear from anyone after you get your food) the girls here are on top of their game and checked in with me half way through my meal. If I lived here I would definitely be back!"
0,"This was the first hotel I stayed in Vegas, and of course at the time I liked it (I didnt know any better), now that time has passed I can say that I really dont like the place (sorry) the area where it is sucks, I take a Downtown Hotel any time, and sometimes they are even cheaper. Oh and dont even get me started on the buffet, it made the person who was with me really sick."
1,"Huge fan.   Great (creative) food, great atmosphere, great scenery.  Throw some bags, or deliver punishment on the foosball table if you like. Also, I love a good microbrew / high gravity beer and The Yard has plenty of those to offer, but I also like a good cheap beer.    The Mystery Beer option is fun -- $2 gets you a random 12 oz can of beer in a brown paper bag.   You don't know what you're getting until it gets to your table.  \n\nThe server typically hangs around to see what you got, although that may be just for show.  Who cares when you can be 5 beers in and walk out of a trendy place like this with a $10 bar tab?  Further, the \""Double Blind\"" gets you a mystery beer plus a mystery airplane bottle of booze for $6.  Hammer Down!  \n\nCheers!"
1,"First time we went, it was five star experience. Great food, great service, awesome beer list, strawberry pop tart... We went back this weekend and it was pretty much the opposite experience. Service was terrible - she never offered me a beer after our flight and I couldn't ever catch her, we didn't care for any of the beers and the \""special\"" burrito I tried was gross and missing half of the ingredients - too bad nobody came back to check or I would have sent it back... This place is always packed, you're gonna wait - check out tap hunter first and make sure you like what beers are on the menu. Its a cool place, we just won't be back anytime soon. Oh and if you can't see from a distance, bring your glasses/binoculars, the beer list is only on the wall."
1,I like their thin crust pizza . For me so far it's the best in the area. The only thing I don't like is the prices. I wish they would offer more deals.
0,"I have to say, I don't get it. \n\n$30+ for bread, a mediocre salad, veggies, soup, horrible prawns, a poor baked potato and a half decent steak in Madison? There has got to be better steak for cheaper elsewhere... \n\nAnd table salt and table pepper? Sorry, but if you're trying to be serious about meat, you've in the least got to have some sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper. \n\nThe beer selection was OK, but you can get the same stuff elsewhere at places that have better food.\n\nI don't know... I've heard that supper clubs are big in the Midwest, and that this place offers a quintessential experience, but maybe I'm just too much of a urbanite-city boy-hipster to enjoy this."
1,"Surpassed my expectations. The previous 5-star reviews pushed me to hire these guys--actually this guy--Lance. He did more than I hoped for, and he gave me great advice on how to maintain the A/C and filters. I'd hire Lance again many times--if only my air vents needed that much cleaning--."

0,"Last night was my first time at Frank and Lupe's. The ambience was nice and outdoor seating was comfortable. I was with a large group (almost 20 of us) and unfortunately the service was not as speedy as we were hoping. Our reservation was for 730 and we had our food by 9 or 915. We had one server taking orders and when food came he had some help but otherwise it was just one person. What such a large group size we understood we would need to wait a little bit, but what was most unfortunate was that the food came out and it was only slightly warm and my order was not as it was described on the menu. I let my server know that I was not as concerned about my order but that he should be more concerned that our guest of honor was clearly not happy. \nAdding an automatic 20% gratuity for a large group is acceptable in most cases, however, i wasn't happy to pay it, though I did. Despite the cold meals, the only extra that was provided to the group was a free shot for the birthday girl. I gave 2 stars with hopes that it was just a fluke. I would try this place again, though only with a small group."
1,"This place is really nice. I have been to my fair share of tanning salons and this place is greeat! I love it. Clean, well maintained, totally new beds. Nice personnel. Whoever was whining about the finger scan technology has a screw loose. So what ?? They scan your finger to bring your account up more quickly and so no one rips off your paid tans. This isn't big brother. It's called high tech. If that would stop you from going to this really nice salon then you are an idiot. They even give you one week free to try out this place. My son who is 22 and I both go here and have had a lovely experience. Highly recommended. Don't pay attention to the whiners on here with their petty complaints. Geesh every business should be run this well."
1,"Jamba juice would be the happist place on earth but for two problems:\n\n1.) The sound of six blenders working in overdrive simultaneously makes my brain bleed and,\n\n2.) The Bunny Ranch is the happiest place on earth. \n\nAs JJ's go, this one is typically clean and staffed with the typical compliment of perky teen-agers all reeking of over-ripe fruit.   Is it expensive for a smoothie?  Hell yeah.  Is it probably out of your way in the morning? Yeah (unless you're a poor shmuck and work at the McDonalds next door).  Are you going to make smoothies on your own using  4 different fruits and orange sherbert complete with nebulously defined \""boosts?\""  \n\nFuck no.   \n\nDrop the $5 and get a smoothie from Jamba.

0,"BEWARE. We left six Britney Spears tickets on the desk of our room before we left for dinner two hours before the concert. When we came back our tickets were gone. Before we left housekeeping came to \nclean our room.\n\nWhen we got back to our room are tickets were gone. We tried everything to get them on our phones went to the box office no help because we got them from stub hub.\n\nI advised front desk of what had happened told them I think housekeeping may have thrown them away. All they did was point me to their lobby computers to print new tickets but after paying for it their printers did not work. \n\nI complained to the manager and the manager said that she spoke with housekeeping and housekeeping did not throw any papers away. Finally we were able to get our tickets from stub hub on our phones and we saw 27 minutes of an hour and a half show which we spent over $1200 to watch.\n\nRight after the show the manager told us they found our tickets which housekeeping did have. In fact she smiled at when while she showed me our tickets. When I asked them to compensate us for the loss of the show, for our rooms or for anything, they refuse to help us whatsoever. They were uncooperative, they were unhelpful, they were rude. I was told the only way they can help me is by filing a report. I do want to get anyone in trouble I just want them took acknowledge what they did to us and to compensate us for the loss of this weekend and the show. \n\nHowever they refuse to do anything other then to call security to our room to investigate and write a report. This place sucks do not stay here they steal from you, lie, and do nothing to help you out."
1,"Very unique store where you should definitely stop by.\n\nYou'll find souvenir at this store that resembles the Bellagio garden.  Everything is somewhat unique and seems like a good fit in your backyard to make it Bellagio garden like.\n\nUnlike Wynn, the prices are VERY affordable too.  At the Wynn store, you may find something cool, but then it ends up being $500-$200000 (yes $200000).  At the Giardini store, things run around $10-500.\n\nThe worker (I believe Esteban?, sorry he was a bigger older gentlemen) )was extremely friendly and literally spent 3 minutes wrapping my statue very carefully.\n\nMy frog has made it home safely."
0,"I had high hopes for my return visit to Olives. Several years ago I had a lovely meal at the restaurant while staying at the Bellagio, but was disappointed with my most recent dinner. \n\nService was both rushed and inattentive, with a sense of urgency to turn the tables coupled with an attitude that more than suggested \""Why bother, we'll never see these people again.\"" Staff wanted to take our meal order even before presenting the menu.\n\nThe foie gras served with my meal was delicate and properly seared. I wish I could say the same for the filet, which - ordered rare - was served over-cooked, dry, and completely unseasoned. Staff were nowhere to be found after dropping off the dishes, so there was no one to run interference with the kitchen.\n\nTodd English, your staff at this outpost can and should do better with both service and cuisine. The Bellagio Hotel & Resort positions itself as a 5 star establishment and purports to have restaurants of the same caliber. Sadly, this spot is letting them down."
1,"Taking advice from a local, I bought two dozen sesame bagels to stock up at home.\n\nSO. GLAD. I. DID.\n\nSorry, NY bagel, you do not even compare. Montreal bagels in general are more bread-y and less dough-y, so they have a great chew. Fairmount bagels, specifically, are handmade, as evident in their misshapen size, and they're so popular that they go straight from the oven rack to people's hands. I initially didn't understand why they're open 24 hours, but now I see the appeal!\n\nI should also mention that having two dozen fresh bagels in a car will set you on olfactory bliss."
0,"My friend and I went to this bar for the first time last night. We ordered our beers from the bar but wanted to order an appetizer so a gal with long a very long blonde pony tail politely found us a booth and gave us menus and said our waitress would be right with us. After 30 minutes went by...we got to the point where we were waving our arms in the air because it appeared that none of the employees saw us. FINALLY we caught the attention of a girl with shorter black hair. We told her we had waited half an hour, and instead of replying politely she got defensive \""If you already have a beer, I assume you have been taken care of. How am I supposed to know that you wanted to order food?!\"" ...hence the menus in our hands. Anyways we order and wait an additional 15-20 minutes to share a quesadilla...once it was ready she threw it on the table as well as our check and took off. I haven't received this poor of service in a long time. We left the waitress a 0.01 tip...maybe next time she will leave her attitude at home. \n\nAdding to this! As we're leaving the bar, the crazy shorter black haired waitress followed us to our car!!! We jumped in and took off. Who knows what she would have done. DONT GO HERE!"
1,"Love this place!!! This is my regular place to eat. I've eaten everything on this menu at least twice. I sometimes have my favorite special made for me, although it's not on the menu.\n\nThey do give you a lot of food though. For the locals from Hawaii...this will make you feel like home."
1,Always excellent...! The service and the food is great. The atmosphere smells great. I didn't need a reservation and i waited 12 minutes... Not bad... Great date place. San Genero event was in town and Nora's was still busy..! That is awesome!
1,"I mainly go here for desserts. I love sweets, chocolate, & anything yummy. \n\nFavorite Desserts top two. \n#1: The Black-tie sundae which has chocolate & vanilla Ice Cream with a outstanding marshmallow cream & to top it off a white chocolate Fudge & Chocolate Fudge, with Whipped Cream & a cute tuxedo strawberry. Omg, delicious. I love anything with chocolate fudgggeeee. This sundae is sensational.  The marshmallow cream is sweet, yet decadent it something I have never tasted before.  \nI can easily eat three orders of this sundae.  The size of the sundae is pretty large it is made for sharing of two. But if you love desserts as much as I do, I believe you can finish it all by yourself, like I have ;] \n\n#2: T he Forbidden Broadway sundae: It has a chocolate blackout cake with  Chocolate & Vanilla Ice Cream that includes hot Fudge & whipped cream.  Reason I love this sundae because it has hot fudge. mmmmmhhh.  The chocolate cake is a little too sweet for me, but the vanilla ice cream compliments it very well.  If you love chocolate this would be the one for you. \n\n\nAnother Sundae I have tried is the  Grasshopper Marshmallow Mint Explosion \nWhich includes a mint chocolate chip ice creams with  Marshmallow Sauce & Hot Fudge & it is topped off with whipped cream & chocolate mints.  When I first saw this sundae it looked like grass and I would think it tasted like those wheat-grass shots you would take at a gym or some health store.. With that being said, I liked it but the way they made it was very much like a milkshake for some reason? \n\nOverall, the food there is okay I dont really recommend eating there.  The prices are overprice for the average food they serve.  The serve is a hit or miss and usually you have long wait times to get a seating."
0,"Overpriced. All the 3 entrees we got tasted like oversalted mush. I've eaten at many veggie restaurants, I expected far more creativity with spices. If the raw lifestyle means uncooked, barely seasoned food, I guess this is your place. You're better off with the  Veggie Delight  on Wynn road or Long life veggie on Sandhill, right off Flamingo."
0,Well if you're looking for speedy service then this is the place for you! I am giving it 1 star because I went on my day off to enjoy myself and get a pedicure there was hardly anyone there when I got there and about 2 mins of my feet being in the water more people came in. The lady that was doing my feet hurried I didn't even have a second to relax the massage and scrub were like 2 seconds. I wasn't there more than 15 mins! I don't know about you but I've always been okay with waiting to get a pedicure because I know when I get mine it will be worth it I guess this place just isn't like that.
0,"Let's just sum it up quickly. Wait was terrible on a late Thursday night. Finally seated, 15 mins before they took our order. Food came out, cold and or overcooked. Only good thing was our waiter, he was doing his best. Will not be returning with all the late night choices down Central."
1,"I used to drive by this place for many years and finally stopped by yesterday. CAN YOU SAY AMAAAAAAZING?! From the authentic Laos decor on both the interior and exterior to the great service, I can not say enough good things about this place! Being a small, what looked to be family owned, restaurant; I expected good service and food from the jump. Lao Thai Kitchen surpassed all of my expectations... by far! The food here is delicious(especially the $6.99 lunch buffet). I highly recommend this restaurant if you're feeling Laos/Thai food for breakfast, lunch or dinner."
0,"Only two stars due to the lack of selection.  No food menu and inside is like a dungeon.  They do have a nice outside area with TVs and a rather secluded environment.  One of these stars is because of their Sunday special.  $4 Car Bomb shots!!  Other than that, they really don't have any other specials.  I asked the bartender why that was?? His response, \""we don't want to attract that kind of crowd.\""  What crowd would that be, sir?? hmmmmm.. Pass on this place.  \n\n-Ian M."
0,"Dealt with this listing agent as a buyer of a property he was representing.  Agent lacks in professional communication, and appropriate avenues in which to do business.  \n\nFor example, he contacted my mortgage company to initiate pre-qualification and property appraisals prior to the home being under contract (he was furnished with a pre-qualification letter during the offer process).  Another example, he contacted my mortgage company to determine if I was still interested in the same property instead of submitting a formal counter offer to my Agent who, concurrently, was in constant communication with him."
0,Most Starbucks are welcoming and friendly.  The manager at this on this am was not.  I asked for a drink with the fixings (2 splenda and 2 shots of cream).  I was rudely told I can do it myself by the manager to the self serve bar.  I have been to various Starbucks and have never been directed to make my iwn drink.  Isn't part of the price the aervice?  Also the membership system was down.  The two stars are for the great decor of the store.
1,pretty good....\n\nFave thing i always get is the Furikake Chicken. \n\nPretty good service and good local vibe of the Restaraunt. Poke pretty expensive but its understandable.\n\nFridays there's usually live music and gets pretty busy so come early.
0,"The prime rib had no salt crust. Almost no flavor. The service was nice, but awkward. My vodka gimlet was far too much rose's lime, but it was serviceable. Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was good."
1,"I've been there twice and both times I was surprised at how good it was.  The first time I had the falafel sandwich and it was fried perfectly crisp on the outside and bursting with flavor on the inside.  The second time I had the gyro platter, which is a mound of shaved gyro meat, pita wedges, jasmine rice and a Greek salad.  It was all great, right down to the Tzatziki You might balk at $9 but it's a huge meal, definitely worth it.  I also suggest the flavored iced teas that they have.  Really, it was all amazing.  You could pick this place up and put it in any city and it would fit right in."
1,"Nothing beats Rapido on a slow week-end morning/early afternoon. Their specials are probably the best deal in that area: an enormous quantity of food for $10 or, including a soup, desert and virtually unlimited coffee.\n\nYou could opt for more classical brunch dishes, but the specials are just fine. I always go with #2, the lady always takes the #1, and we're both happy campers afterwards.\n\nThe service is fast, they give you a table for 4-6 even when there's two of you, they stock a giant pile of Journal de Montreal so that you can feel trashy for a bit while reading it. \n\nThe waitresses are (all?) Russian so if you understand it, you can get some of their gossip :)\n\nAll in all, Rapido is an institution that is worth visiting at least once!\n\nCash only!"
0,"Turns out eating here, appropriately, is a crap game. Food always OK To good. Service, you need to bring your luck."
1,"Why is Earl's so good? The bun. The combinations. The price. That they are open late. My favs are the Original, the Italian, and the Cannonball. The line can be long, especially after the clubs let out, but the wait isn't too bad. I just don't know how else to describe how delicious these hot sandwiches are! You must try!"
0,"So I'm watching Diners, Drive-in's and Dive's on the Food Network and they do a feature on this place.  Go on and on about the waffles.  So the next morning, we head over.  Walk up to the building and people everywhere just standing around.  So I walk in side and was stopped by a server and told to step outside.  She handed me a clipboard and walked back in.  Apparently, I was suppose to put my own name down on the list to be seated, so I did.  We waited almost and hour.  We were finally called to head in.  Walk in and can't believe how tiny this place is...they sit the three of us down at a table made for one so we're all fighting over elbow space.  Look over the menu and decide to order a waffle, eggs and OJ.  Server tells me the waffle iron is broken.  That was the only reason I came here because of the so called world famous waffles.  So I settle for pancakes, eggs and OJ.  They bring out my teaspoon of OJ.  Seriously I have never had such a small glass of OJ.  The food finally arrives, and to tell you the truth, it was good but not worth the hour of my life I spent standing outside waiting.  I'll stick to IHOP."
0,"Very Americanized; haven't tried the sushi, but why would you eat sushi at a Chinese restaurant?"
1,"I ate here Thursday night while in town. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the service was and the items were reasonably priced! I had the \""Cowboy Steak\"" (rib eye) and it was prepared excellently."
0,"Oh dear Lord, what an experience...\n\nProblem number one is the front line staff does not speak English even to an 'average' level.  I placed a very simple order (even pointing to the item on the menu) and it turned into a rendition of Who's On First.\n\nAfter some discussion a second employee stepped in (he was wearing a polo, so I am assuming he is leadership) and the problem did not resolve.  Eventually, my food was complete, relatively close to what I ordered and I paid the rather large bill for 2 adults.  The front end/ordering experience was absolutely horrible to the point that I would really avoid this business going forward and find a different Qdoba.\n\nNow for the food: I had steak tacos and the 3-cheese nachos.  Excellent.  Great flavor, savory, tender, all around good.  Good seasoning, perfectly cooked.  If I had even adequate service they would not get less than 4 stars.\n\nUnfortunately, they tarred and feathered me prior to the food experience so I probably won't be back (to this location)."
1,"I think I come here almost every time im in vegas for some reason or another. It IS the cure for any hangover and I always want some asian goodness and am too lazy to drive that one mile to china town. \n\nMy personal favorites here are the beef noodle soup and fried rice. Extremely oily but just oily enough to soak up the alcohol from the night before. \n\nFor vegas, the prices are reasonable you can probably get away wtih spending 12 bucks an entree and the best part is its walking distance from ti wynn venetian and palazo."
1,"Love the samosa factory. The staff are delightful, food delicious & such a pleasant atmosphere. I've taken family & friends here & everyone loved it. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for some delicious Indian food!"
1,"Wow !! The Sage Fried Chix Benedict dish was ORGASMIC !! Huge and I ate the whole thing ( Never ate the rest of the day) Every bite uncovered bacon or eggs or a biscuit, this is a close to glutanny as one could get and walk away unscathed !! This dish was a work of art and the chef a rockstar in my mind, wish I took a photo of it !! I will return and you should too !! Plaza charges 5 bucks to park but get the tix validated and the main casino cage gives you your 5 spot back !! \""Nuff said !!!"
0,"I have been to many a asian mart in my day but this place is really the epitome of the stereotype of an asian mart. \n\nThere are no windows in the bulk of the store and the windows in the front are all covered up......I have no idea why..........\n\n.......still wondering why.........\n\nMoving on, I can see the appeal of this store as they do carry 13208923874820983534 brands of oriental specialty items like all of the candies, snacks, dried food, teas, etc. This place is packed from ceiling to the ground and the aisles were just afterthoughts! \n\nThe produce section was borderline scary and I would never buy produce from there. With the amount of people that were in there when I was there I would think that they would have enough money to expand....or at least brighten the place up a bit!!! There wasn't too many things in the produce section that I wouldn't be able to find in another grocery store, although I'm pretty sure they would never be as cheap at another place!\n\nDisappointed that they didn't carry any oriental dishes/cups/teapots/platters/etc.\n\nI wouldn't come back unless I was in DIRE need of something that I couldn't find anywhere else...the way that the store is kept is really a reflection of the owners interest in it....and this place is seriously depressing."
1,"I called John out for an estimate last Thursday for a cracked sewer pipe. he told me it would take two days to complete the work since it went under the front porch and I didn't want the porch torn up. he said he had a co-worker that could get into tight spaces shovel it out with a spoon. He wasn't lying. his co-worker got right in there and sawed the roots and dug it out. they started Monday and finished Monday. My wife thought the water was going to be off for long period, they didn't have to turn the water off and she could finally start prepping food for dinner. so she was happy it wasn't a long job and if she's happy I'm happy lol. would like to thank John and his co-worker for everything especially for completing the job in one day instead of two."
0,"2 TVs in 3 weeks. The first one lasted 2 days, the second one two weeks. The first time I walked in the guy was nice and friendly. When I exchanged the first TV he had a bad attitude. What a waste of money. I guess you get what you pay for. Apparently no refunds only exchanges. So now I'm stuck hauling TVs back and forth every month. Awful experience"
0,"Go here for the atmosphere and thats about the only reason to stop here.\n\nThe food was decent nothing special, the service was average, and I understand its vegas and the food was way over priced for nothing above average food.\n\nOverall, if you are with kids this would be a great place to check out because the would love it, other wise not really worth your time."
1,"Very laid back place with retro arcade games and Nintendo 64 on some of the wall tables for you to play with old school games.  The service was friendly and pretty quick.  not a fan of the plastic draft beer glasses, that were more like scotch glasses, only knock. Food was pretty good and great happy hour prices on drinks and some snacks. Would definitely like to go back."
0,Recently stayed here for a brief overnight on our way into the desert. Unbelievable how dirty the Room was. The bathroom had crap on the mirror and gunk on the faucet. The walls were filthy as well as the shower. The shower head looked like it had been duct taped to the wall and several of the towels had holes in them. \nThe glasses were so dirty that I wouldn't even drink out of them after we washed them. The bed was my favorite part. There were staines on almost every piece of linen. I had to strategically position the sheets so my g/f would notice or we would have been trying to change rooms at 1 am. I honestly cannot understand how or why a place would even bother operating at such a low level.
0,"Better than most chain pizza, it's ok.  \n\nWe got a thin crust, which was nice and crispy, only a little greasy, ok ingredients, not amazing on the cheese, and had kind of a bland crust.\n\nI guess that doesn't sound too good, but I really promise it's better than any national chain pizza you'll find in town.  It also has a really friendly, laid-back atmosphere."
1,"I've been reading the reviews and was a little confused by the negative reviews. I usually don't write reviews but thought I must on this one. \nI've eaten at the north locations and was so glad when we got a branch in the west valley. My son introduced me to this restaurant and it has never let me down. \nI ordered take out for all of my family when they were here for funeral services for Mom. There were no complaints on the food, presentation was good, it was Friday night but we did not have to wait long and I was not disappointed at all in the food.\nI just purchased entrees to go and the service was good. I know it was take out but I had to travel almost an hour on my way home and asked them to cook it at a specific time so everything was fresh. Their server even called me with a question about the order and brought me a water to go when I left. Very respectful and I received everything I asked for and it was very good. \nThanks for putting an Arriba's in our area. I don't eat out much but will be back."
0,"After constantly hearing about Blackstrap BBQ this place has been a Yelp bookmark of mine for months now. Sadly it's located in Verdun and only a special occasion would bring me to this part of town... as luck would have it a small community Yelp event brought close to a dozen Yelpers to this place during happy hour. I just couldn't say no to this.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is that it's pretty much a hole in a wall, you can easily walk RIGHT by without even noticing it. Parking in this area is also ridiculously difficult as the area houses countless duplexes that has locals taking up all the parking spots leaving you to take the paid parking spots... which haven't been modernized in any shape or form. It's 2014 folks, I've been paying my parking spots all over Montreal for the last decade from an mobile app or parking machine that accepts credit cards... why is this place still accepting coins? Ridiculous!\n\nI ordered their reputed burnt ends poutine and some root beer. The service was about an average wait but they were kind enough to bring me my food while I was sitting outside on their terrace with fellow Yelpers while I nursed my root beer. :)\n\nSadly, I wasn't a fan of their poutine. While the metal encased portion was generous and it was definitely heavy... I couldn't finish it for multiple reasons. \n\nKindly note, that I feel I might be the oddball here but I felt the fries weren't up to par to what I've had for places hyped such as this place. The cheese was somewhat skimped on and the gravy sauce... which should hold everything together... was weak. The brisket meat was good though. They do offer you some BBQ sauce bottles to spice up their poutine such as a sweet or spicy sauce container but I honestly feel if you NEED to do this, your poutine isn't really what it should be. Fries, cheese curds, gravy. Maybe some extra condiments to your liking... that's what it should be. Sweet or spicy sauce shouldn't be added. But that's just me. However, the sweet sauce made the mediocre poutine actually more edible. So Hooray?\n\nThe price tag is somewhat expensive for poutine. I know there's a sort of gastronomic feeling to have that meat in your poutine, I still felt this poutine was far more expensive than it should be. \n\nI'm sure from other reviews they have other quality things one can order but I haven't had the chance and thus my reviews is solely for the poutine and thus, it's pretty forgettable amongst stiff competition in Montreal and while other Yelpers beside me were dealing with hairs found in their portion of poutine or the extremely fatty cuts of brisket, I guess this place simply isn't for me."
0,"Holy cinnamon all up in your face!  Cinna-cones, cinna-brooms, cinna-wreaths,  cinna-scents galore! Everything smells like cinnamon and I hate the smell of cinnamon! I even smelled like cinnamon a day after going into the store.  I burped and guess what it smelled like? CINNAMON! \n\nHappy Holidays"
0,":(  Here's the TL;DR\n\n- Average food for above average price\n- Meals were cold when served\n\nThese are the facts:\n\nI made a reservation to celebrate my 5th wedding anniversary, I let the hostess know when I called and when I arrived that we were celebrating with our family and that most of us drove from out of state to have this meal, we were super excited. \n\nWe sat nestled between the entrance and the hostess desk so that half of the table had the privilege of scooting our chairs for other parties being seated farther in the back, and the other table got to sit with the 3 hostesses' booties on their neck all evening.\n\nWe ordered drinks which were refilled only once during our pleasant 2 hour stay. \n\nOur orders were taken about 30 minutes from our being seated, but we didn't receive our food for another hour.\n\nThese are not my feelings, these are the cold, hard facts.\n\nCold and hard like the $26 fried chicken my husband ordered. His mashed potatoes were a soupy consistency. I have a picture if you wanna see.\n\nMy ABC Chicken sandwich was okay, the C stands for caramelized onions, but it was cold by the time I got a hold of it so they were more like soggy worms. Okay, that's not a fact, I don't know what worms are like but I can imagine.\n\nMore facts:\nSomeone in our party ordered a burger with no pink, but when he bit into it it was still bloody. The waiter did pop by 30 minutes later and asked if he wanted it remade but everyone's bubble had been burst by then. \n\nI told the manager I wasn't happy with my experience or the quality of the food. She was offended when I compared it to Red Robin, but I've never had a cold meal or left dissatisfied, so I think I did Red Robin a disservice by comparing these two. Sorry big red bird.\n\nAfter the manager got over her indignation, she comped us a sundae. So our party of 8 shared a sundae. Kudos lady, thanks.\n\nI felt bad that my family wasted time and money here. It was my decision and I have to live the rest of my life with that on my shoulders. Maybe I'll write the company instead of writing a passive-aggressive review on a third-party site... I think I'll do that."
0,"Honestly one of the worst fine dining experiences I have had in a decade - we came in on a Tuesday night, after a show, they were not busy, the service was awful.  the pre meal extras are nice and taste great.  It seemed like the waiter didn't realize we wanted to order food, when he finally came up to greet us and go over specials it honestly seemed as if he was high or drunk.  When he tried to repeat our order to us it was like he was reading someone else's order and he had literally just written it down.  To top that off he completely forgot all 4 of our appetizers and 3 of our 4 side dishes - when the captain finally came over to ask how things were and we explained he was obviously embarrassed and then the waiter seemed as if he was forced to come over and apologize like a small child begging for forgiveness.  That would've been fine but then we never saw the guy again, nobody came to offer desserts or coffee (and we had even explained that the 5 of us were their for a birthday dinner) - nothing  was comp'd as an apology, not even a visit from the manager to say anything.  With all of the competition for fine dining in Vegas we honestly would've expected much more, especially considering the prices.  Chicken parm was so salty it was like someone had dumped extra salt all over it, was totally not edible but we never even had the opportunity to send it back because we couldn't find our waiter again - oh well, at least we won big in the casino that night"
1,"We stopped into Madison for the evening.  We were looking for some local fare. The hotel desk clerk recommended The Old Fashioned.  It was a short drive to the capital building.  It was Sunday night, I was amazed that the place was packed.  That had to be a good sign.  We had the following the Old Fashioned burger, fried cheese curds, the Wurst platter and two kids meals.  The burger was likely the best burger I have had in my life.  Absolutely incredible.  The cheese curds are battered in house, not frozen.  They were incredible.  We have a German exchange student with us, he has been sampling sausage all over the Midwest hoping to find something as good as home.  The Sausage on the platter was \""exactly like home\"" however the sour kraut was not to his liking.  We also had the beer cheese soup.  It was more beer than soup, it was good but not what I expect from a cheese soup.   This trip was great"
1,"Smallish place,modern,spare decor, complete with a fake fireplace and exposed brick walls. We were a party of 4 in for late lunch and started with a cold fungus and coriander salad,very tasty,followed by another cold dish of spicy Schecwan beef noodles.This was tasty as well,but the beef was nothing but grizzle. Third order was pan-fried veggie dumplings,very good,followed by an order of pan-fried chicken/coriander filled dumplings....delicious!\nWe then proceeded with the last dish ordered,crispy pancakes;essentially a crispy pancake stuffed inside an omelette... tasty with a touch of spice. All in all,very good with prompt service.Only complaint...tea was warm."
1,"I spent 3 nights at the Mirage last weekend, and have also visited the Casino on several other occasions. \n\nThe Mirage is a nice hotel. Rooms are very clean, spacious, and comfortable. The casino is smaller than most of the others on the strip... I personally like that about the Mirage, because it is a little less overwhelming than the other resorts and it is easy to navigate. We had an amazing view from the 23rd floor that looked out over both the strip and the hotel pool/dolphin habitat (we woke up to jumping dolphins!)\n\nThe pool is beautiful. Went to most of the bars and lounges and it was a good time. Lots of drink specials and relaxed atmosphere. \n\nWe ran into no problems with check-in or check-out, received several comps and a $75 resort credit, and found everyone to be very friendly and pleasant. \n\nThe only thing I would say is I wish there were more casual late night dining options. BLT Burger is awesome, but I want some variety. The only other place that's open late is the Carnegie Deli, and it is insanely overpriced (being from New York it was hard to justify spending $25 on a pastrami sandwich). \n\nThe BEST thing about the Mirage is it's location! It is central on the strip! Close to plenty of public transportation options, but a quick walk to most of the shopping centers, and a breeze to get to most of the other casinos. \n\nI would definitely stay here again."
1,"I would give this place 5 stars if it were free to eat there! Mmmmmmmmm  Great service every time. Strong drinks. The 2 dips they bring with the chips, right when you sit down, are outstanding. Wait, THOSE are free, so maybe I should make it 5 stars. Authentic Mexican? Who the hell knows, but it tastes grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat! And fills me up every time. 2 full meals, 2 drinks all for around $30. Find the 2 for 1 coupon and you are a rock star."
0,"Douche bag central! \n\nLike douche bags? Want to get treated like shit? Want to hang out with people who think they are the shit? Come here! Waste money!\n\nWe tried to get in on Sunday for Rehab this past weekend and it was a fuckin clusterfuck!\n\nWaited in line, got let up to the front of the line. DB bouncer told us that we cut in line. Say what? Puh-lease, don't be an ass. You want to charge girls $50 to get in and guys $100??\n\nAnd then you are gonna bust attitude on me and call me a fuckin liar? \n\nEff that! I ain't having this shiet. \n\nRehab can suck it. Wet Republic is way better than this place. \n\nAnd no, I did not waste my money here. Who wants to pay for shitty attitude?"
1,"I never knew this place was here! It definitely adds some class to the Tempe Cinema plaza.\n\nI met some friends here for a birthday celebration. Inside, it looks very much like what you'd expect a real Italian restaurant to look like. We were in the bar area (Enoteca) to the right. Its very homey feeling. We sat at a nice long picnic style dark wood table. It was just right for the amount of people we had.\n\nOur server was very, very nice and attentive. Especially since we had people arriving at different times. They have an excellent wine selection. We all tried a different flatbread, which were a really good size for 1, if youre really hungry, and perfect for sharing. I had the Pugliese and it was very, very good. I would absolutely recommend it and this place to others wanting a nice semi intimate setting for a happy hour or dinner. \n\nWe left just as the accordion player started his rounds, not a fan. They also have plenty of kitschy souvenirs for purchase. Check it out!"
0,"Here's the deal- As far as food goes, this place deserves 5 stars, its inventive, fresh, Mexican food and always amazing. The location is great and I would love to frequent it. However, the owner Azucena Tovar always comes off as a little ambivalent about her clientel, and I just can't get over it. We eat out a lot. My expectation and hope is an evening with great company, food, and service. Great company I can handle, great food Los Sombreros has covered...but the service makes me wince. The owner is the first person to greet you at the door and she is abrasive and has been rude (kinda sets the tone, it's her place after all). Not once, not twice, but several times. I try and support businesses that value and appreciate their clients, especially in this financial climate. So my compromise is take-out. We only (rarely) order take-out and on the condition my husband picks it up so I dont have to be reminded why we no longer eat there. Christmas tamales are to die for."
1,"Six Penn is a great place for dinner or lunch in Pittsburgh.  It is fairly casual but has very good food and very good service.  It has a good range of food choices and a good bar.  It is great for a business lunch, an office party for a small group of 25 or fewer, or for dinner with someone special.  It is also conveniently located in the downtown area near the Gateway T stop.  It doesn't have outdoor seating but the windows on the Penn Avenue side can be opened so for the booths on that side it seems like outdoor dining without sitting on the sidewalk. I recommend Six Penn and have always enjoyed my meals there."
0,This place has horrible horrible customer service!  And this was from the store's manager!  Our office staff orders from them on a daily basis and I myself order at least $50 worth of food when I do so they're definitely losing out on that since I'm now calling the other location close by to place my orders.  I wish there were other places that delivered in my area.\n\nHaha looking at the other dissatisfied reviews for this location it sounds like the manager at this location has major customer service issues!  I'm seriously considering calling corporate...wondering if that would even do anything?
1,"Overdue review because finally tried this place with mom and aunts last year because we wanted to enjoy the Bellagio Fountains while dining.  Made reservations for the patio and the VIEW was spectacular! \n\nBread Basket with olives and olive tapenade was deelish especially the white chocolate bread!!!\n\nDishes ordered: Butternut Squash Pasta, Lobster Pasta, and Bass (I think)... we all shared and all of it was deelish!\n\nDesserts: Mango Brulee and Hazelnut Souffle and OMG both were too die for!!! Especially the Hazelnut Souffle!!!  Also, since my mom's birthday the server brought out 3 different kinds of truffles and they were FANTASTIC!!!"
0,"This is a family run restaurant in Laval.  The best parts were that it is a bring your own wine restaurant and the service was good.  Other than that the food was not good and was especially expensive considering the quality of the food.  The portions were good, but the food was not good. The fish of the day was overcooked so that it was very dry and the sauce that went with it was horrible.  Also, they did not get the order right for the sides.  Not a good experience.  Others at the table were equally unimpressed with their meals.  \n\nAlso, it took a long time for our meals to come out to the table.\n\nAll this for a $50 per person meal.  There are much better options available at any price."
0,"Drove by this place and although sign says open looks like they are under construction. Food is extremely bland and for the healthy option they have no brown rice. They do not do any substitutes nor can they make anything spicy they just bring you hot chili on the side. First and last time here. Although service was great, lunch food terrible."
1,"Came here with my wife and family to check out what was going on at this giant location. I'd popped in here once before and was ready to take the crew for a fun and exciting field trip.\n\nWhat a really cool and clean place to buy large portions of the foods that you would see and eat at many of your standard chain restaurants. They even have all the necessary things to keep the cooks happy in the kitchen as well as several items to keep you on the top of the health departments \""A\"" lists.\n\nThis store is not for the regular grocery shopper. The portion sizes are larger than that Price Club place and probably better for giant parties or catering events. We decided to come in and split the big portions amongst family members and co-workers to keep things real.\n\nHad to pick up a 10# box of Walleye and a 6# of breaded Oysters on this visit. There were also some Sauces on the Asian aisle that sneaked into my cart. The ladies in my group picked out some produce from the cooler and I checked out the meat section for next time. Homer ... Brisket!\n\nYou do need a member's card to get into this place. It is FREE and the information that they ask for is relatively general. Just walk up to the customer service section and they will gladly point you in the right direction.\n\nTake you time and give everything a good look. The labels on much of the boxed items only have a small description on them and not a lot of those flashy marketing gimmicks on the sides.\n\nThe walk in cooler is also a treat and very large. Don't not worry about getting too cold or having to bring special clothing. They have several complementary bright yellow (NASA) jackets that are available right by the self opening cooler doors. \n\nSee ya there next time. I'll be hovering over the Brisket and the Pork Shoulder. COOL MAN!\n\n4 STARS"
1,"Everything is great about this place, with the exception of the food, which was okay.  The layout, and design of the location is great, and the staff is extremely friendly.  However I wasn't crazy over the food, there just wasn't enough flavor.  I ordered the Asparagus Fusilli which I found to be extremely sour; likely caused by the tomatos.  The person I was with ordered the Stuffed Chicken, which turned out to be much better.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the Garlic Bread, I advice against this, it wasn't bad, but then again, there isn't much you can do wrong with 4 pieces of bread, toasted with cheese, probably the first thing anyone learns to cook.  Instead of this, go for something else a little less common, I don't even know why it's on their menu.\n\nThe food took longer than usual to come out, but nothing to be upset over.  It looks like the cook is having a tough time come up with great dishes when restricted to just local ingredients.\n\nGiven the limited choices in the tri-city area, this restaurant gets a bonus star, from 3 to 4.  If I were in-charge, the only thing I would change is the menu."
1,Lunch buffet was so good and reasonably priced!  We'll definitely be going back.
0,Today's meal was not very good. The chicken was too dry and cooked too long. I was told it was more than two days ago that the oil was changed.  I have found high-quality meals in the stores in Goodyear and .
0,"I stopped by to get some coffee and snack at the center bar. The bartender was loud and awkward in his behaviour ignoring me for the first 5 minutes. He was definitely under the influence. Finally he asked me what i needed (!) I asked him if he could make a cup of iced latte and after the positive answer, ordered such. He made hot coffee, dropped couple ice cubes in it, added milk - that was his definition of ice latte. I didn't want to make a big deal, paid, took my coffee and left. On the way out I sipped my coffee hoping it was ok, but it was disgusting colored water. I had to come back and asked the bartender if he could make another normal one. He turned red, and loudly in aggressive manner was demanding answers what was wrong with the coffee he made. I explained to him after what he yelled in my face i should go get coffee somewhere else. He throw couple dollar bills at me screaming \""you can go and have it on me\""...i actually paid for it (!) I did let him know he is out of control and rude asking to speak to his manager. He yelled me \""And who are you for me to do so?\"" He took a business card out of the pocket throwing it at me, saying \""here, come and visit me!\"" \nThe following day i got a hold of the general manager of double Helix bar and boutique. She seemed to be aware of the situation but expressed very little interest at hearing it from me. There was simply no appology. I made it very clear I didnt come to ask for any accommodation from them, but wanted the bartender to be held accountable for his unappropriate insaulting behaviour. The manager refused to contact the owner and refused to provide me with his contact info. \nThe following day, I was reading some Vegas magazine and ran accross an article about Double Helix and the owner. From that article I got his name and decided to try my luck by emailing him at the address combined in several variations of his first and last name at doublehelix website, hoping he wasn't aware of the situation but can satisfy my request. \nSuprisingly i got an answer from him in a day or so. It was full of protection for his bartender, indicating how great he was and hinting how much i was wrong and unappropriate (!) Are you kidding me?! Big spendings or not, i was a customer! I thanked Mr Nisi for his time but let him know i will use my way for the truth to come out planning on writing the review at least. In return, Mr Nisi got a hold of my employer making up false accusations and saying i was threatening him. Sure, if writing a review is a threat!...I believe i have all rights to do so. It wasn't a threat, it was a promise. \nThe lesson of my story is - there are retailers, bartenders, owners of businesses, people working in customer service who does judge you by the way you are dressed and how much money you spend. They are not willing to take care of you even though it is their job and they are paid for it! We, customers, pay for it. And I refuse to pretend it is ok the get this kind of service in \""high-end\"" place. Wine, dinner, coffee, or water, doesn't matter. And no matter how wonderful Double Helix may sound on their main web page, the reason to have a rude bartender, it is because it is allowed for him to be so, it is beacuse the owner himself exactly like that! Simply a jerk"
1,"They are under new ownership and management. Excellent place to have your nails done.  Very clean,  awesome staff, the manager Danielle is amazing! She is a fabulous nail tech and she is a very sweet person. I won't be going anywhere but there. Very reasonably priced also."
1,"Since Kai by my house closed, I have been trowling my neighborhood looking for a new sushi spot.  Ventured a little outside the neighborhood to come to this place, but the reviews were so good on Yelp, I had to go and see for myself.  \n\nVery friendly staff.  Always a plus.  Really bumping on a Thursday night.  It looked like a lot of 30 somethings come here for date night.  Definitely a good atmosphere. We tried to order all of the rolls that sounded spicy because that's our thing. Everything we tried was really good, just not quite spicy enough for me.  My favorite roll was the Volcano roll.  Good value for the AYCE price of $26. Will definitely return and be sure to request extra spice.  Still haven't found anything better than Sin City for AYCE."
1,"Great food with great flavor, nice place to have a romantic dinner, I had the paella with was delicious but my girlfriend had the lamb which I thought I would have order that too. The waiter was very polite and always there if we needed something I would definitely go back and try some other foods on there menu."
0,"It was later and we were in Vegas for my niece's 21st birthday.  We were staying at Vdara so decided to give Haze a try since it was in the neighboring hotel Aria.  The staff is super friendly and managed to get us a table in no time.  We didn't have to wait in the long line or make a reservation. However, that being said, this place so-so compared to the more upscale nightclubs in Vegas. Bottle service is about $500 a bottle and the decor reminds me of clubs I could find in Hollywood.  For a true Vegas nightclub experience, got to any of the other clubs. Ex, Tao, Tryst, XS..."
1,"Good deals, decent produce and friendly employees. They could use a couple more self checkout lanes sometimes but it's usually not too bad. What else could you want?"
0,"I live in the area and was excited when I saw a Dim Sum place opening up.  Sadly food is borderline inedible.  \n\nThe Mushroom Shiu Mai....the mushroom it was served on couldn't be cut!  It acted like rubber.  You put a knife to it and it would retain it's shape once you lifted the knife from it.  I've never seen a mushroom do this.  Needed to make serious effort to cut through it.  I tried a small taste  and had to remove it from my mouth.  \n\nThe shrimp dumplings/potsticker seemed old.   The shrimp in the dumpling was mushy and fell apart.  It was not seasoned and was bland.  Took one bite and left the rest.  \n\nThe one cart of food they were selling looked old.  The egg rolls did not look like they were made in house.   When asked about some of the other dim sum on the menu the said that was made to order as it doesn't hold well.   Which gave me reason to believe the food on the cart wasn't made right away and looked its age.  \n\nThe pork buns were \""OK\"" nothing special.  Could use a bit more filling in the buns.  \n\nThe Chicken dumplings were average.  They were actually the saving grace of the experience.   Found it odd you had to actually request the standard sauces that are served at normal dim sum places.   We had the hot mustard and the red chili.  Both sauces were good.  \n\nThe ice tea was fresh......I wasn't offered a refill or asked if I wanted another drink.\n\nI don't think the place will be there for long."
1,I fear telling the world about this place will only make it harder for me to get a table. Love the food. Can not beat these prices!! I eat here quite often and I would give 5 stars but the service can be spotty. My kids love the teppan  table and they give them a good show. Sushi is fresh and also an amazing price compared to most places. Highly recommend trying this place out.
0,"Well i hate to be the bearer of bad news...but these doughnuts are average at best. My co-workers bring some in to work about twice a week and each time they taste the same to me. The doughnuts have to much dough so to speak...and quite frankly they are really to big to enjoy as a doughnut. The last time i checked doughnuts should be a joy to eat...not a chore. I think i will stick to my Krispy Cremes if you don't mind my fellow yelpers. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!"
0,"This business is completely unprofessional.  I am a strong supporter of capitalism, which means that enterprises that do not make customers happy should not remain in business.  The market eventually sorts out the lousy businesses--like this one. \n\n  The people working here are very unprofessional.  When I get a massage, I don't want to hear the girls giving me a massage talking to their friends.  This is a workplace.  Be quiet.  We came here to relax, not to hear your banter.  So you get a failing mark on relaxation.  The massage is average to above average.  The presentation and decor of the place is \""bare bones.\""  After you get a massage and leave a tip, even a good tip, they always demand more.  It is very insulting and rude and it is poor customer service skills.  I will not be returning because there are a lot of other great opportunities in Vegas and one does not need to go to a foot massage spa that gives you pressure from a) workers talking during the massage and b) demanding a higher tip.  Save your money."
0,"Much like the Rio and the Sahara... the Spearmint Rhino is a standing memorial of Las Vegas days gone past. While once at the very top of Las Vegas adult venues, the Rhino has slowly turned - much to the delight of the Vegas \""old guard\""  - as THE place to find wild women who are sick and tired of dancing at those overrated \""trendy\"" spots.  Nightly people watching sessions provide amusement for blue collar and white collar worker alike, as the girls here are friendly and accommodating to even the smallest budget. If you are low on dough but want to be \""in the know\"" then the Rhino is the place for you!"
1,Ryley girl you are fantastic! She had a great personality and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. \nThe steak and eggs Benedict on an everything bagel was perfection. The BF got the ultimate breakfast and loved it as well. The chilaquiles were delicious. Bread in a pot gets an A+ from me. Oh and how could I forget the hash-browns seriously sooo good. I was sad I couldn't finish my meal. \n\nThe decor and staff adds to the charm of this neighborhood breakfast spot.
1,"The best tacos in Las Vegas hands down.\n\nThere was two of us, we ordered 3 asada and spicy pork taco. It was so good, we ordered 3 more each again right away. When I was ordering the second round, I realized the corn tortilla was fresh made right there. That's why the taco was so good.\n\nAnybody appreciates authentic Mexican food, you have to go there and give it a try.\n\nI gave 4 stars for the high price and not so good service(bad attitudes). The taco is quite small for $2 each, I had to eat 7 to get full."
1,"I heard about this little gem when I overheard some people raving about it at the top of camelback mountain. I try to treat myself after my hikes, so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm so glad I did! It's a hole in the wall(those are always the best!). It's crowded  with people waiting for their order. It's not a typical sit down place. You order at the window, pay, and move to the side with everyone else and wait for your food. It's a bit of a wait, but wow, you won't be sorry for the wait. I got the green chile burrito, enchilada style. Now, I can't tell you what makes it so good, it just is. It's messy and absolutely delicious! They have several tables outside(no inside seating), but most people get it to go. Do yourself a favor and give it a try."
0,"Review for Gold Package Car Wash on the day before Thanksgiving: \n\nHere is what happens when you get a car wash here: \n-You drive up and go to the line for car washes\n-The guy asks you what service you want\n-You drive through the car wash\n-Car is washed\n-You drive to the drying area where guys help dry off your car and clean as needed per the package you buy\n-You go to the lounge and wait\n-A guy calls your car when ready\n-You go get your car\n\nPayment is either when the guy asks you what kind of your service you want or when you head to the lounge to wait. \n\nCurrently, there is a Yelp Deal $17 for $22 (saves you $5, which you can use for tip)\n\nSo you wonder, the afternoon before Thanksgiving, how busy could it be? \nWell, the answer is busy.\n\nFrom the time I checked in to the time I picked up my car, it was over 1 hour.\n \nApparently, there were 3-4 SUVs or Trucks in front of my car which made my service longer. Not only that, because the guys were spending so much time on these other vehicles in front of me, my car was not wiped down properly and spots dried all over the exterior of my car when they pulled it up for me. I had to ask the guy to wipe down the car, and at some point I asked for a towel and he said he couldn't give me a towel (I suppose it is against policy for a customer to wipe down their own car). I felt bad for this guy because I don't think he was the one who started on my car in the first place; he just drive it up and found himself cleaning up someone else's work. I also asked him if it usually took 1 hour and he said no, it usually is about 30 minutes but my car was behind the trucks. I appreciated his time and honesty, tipped him, and took off to run the rest of my errands for the day. \n\nI would try them again, just to give them a benefit of the doubt as I do believe it is normally faster than what I experienced. Until then, 2 stars it is."
1,"I love this restaurant!  Everything I have ever ordered has been very good, and we have been here many, many times.  After reading through some of the reviews for CPC here on yelp, I have to say that I am a bit surprised by what people are complaining about.\n\n-I have never once noticed a \""smell\"" upon entering the building at this location.\n-I have been to both the Tempe and the Mesa location, and the portion sizes are the same at both locations.\n-The servers and cooks are not \""dingy,\"" whatever that means.  In all of the times we have been to this location, we have never, not once, had a bad server.  They are all friendly and respectful.\n-The only dirty-ness I have experienced there is some broken candlewax on the tables indoors, and tables that haven't been bused yet outdoors (they turn over that fast!)\n\nMy only complaint is that when we first started going to the Mesa location when they opened, they were quiet.  Now, they are constantly busy...any time of the day.  But that isn't really anything to complain about; that business means that hopefully they will be there for years to come.\n\nMake your own menu decisions, but some pasties that I like include:\nPesto Chicken\nLovely bit of Salmon\nChicken Greek\nChicken pot pie\n\nThe oven fries are also great...order them with garlic and mustard cream sauce.  You won't be disappointed."
0,Coffee was good. The service sucked. Rude and very condescending. Maybe she was having a bad day. But man was she rude.
0,"We have eaten here many times over the years both at the original 40th St and Bell location and this newer location at 40th and Thunderbird location.  Nearly every time the food has been well prepared and delicious, plus the service was always attentive.  My only issue with it was I considered to be a rather pricy restaurant.\n\nThe last two times we have been there have been rather disappointing.  I don't know if there is a new chef / owner or what, but the food is not as good as before and our dishes very greasy.  The prices are still as high as before.  The service we had the other night was abominable.   The server, Jenn, was one of the worst servers we have experienced in a long time.  There were two occupied tables when we arrived (and two other servers) and we had to wait for over ten minutes to be acknowledged and for our drink order to be taken.  The specials she told us were not the same as another server was telling his table.  The meal went downhill after that.  We had to ask and re-ask for just about everything.  The one bright spot was the bus girl who was so attentive.  Jenn kept telling us how busy she was (at her busiest she had three tables) yet she had plenty of time to talk at length to a table about what was happening on the TV show \""Big Brother\"".  It even took forever to get the check, which was finally handled by another server.\n\nAll in all, it was a disappointing, expensive meal that was ruined even further by a terrible server."
1,"A convenient market to do your main shopping. I was here getting supplies for NYE '13 and found everything I needed.\n\nThe self check out was awesome, and employees are friendly.\n\nCoffee shop was a nice bonus to get loaded with energy before the big night!"
0,"This was probably the biggest waste of money.  We got the table d'hote which was 60 bucks per person.  A lot of filler courses for pizzazz that just wasnt impressive, really a lot of fluff.  Started off with the lobster cappucino, which was good once you got passed the cream part.  The appetizer were parmesan crisps with goat cheese.  For appetizers we had the crab declination which was a trio of crab (not good, so bland), got the seared foie gras in which we really enjoyed the morel mushroom emulsion.  The highlight of the meal was definitely our entree.  If we had ordered only the entree we would have rated the meal higher.  We had the filet of halibut, cooked perfectly over creamy mashed potatoes, with a tomato \""ketchup\"".  The veal cheeks were great! They were cooked perfectly, and were very flavorful.  Dessert was weird.  It was like a strawberry parfait, different, but not good with madelines.  They also brought out some petit fours consisting of passion fruit marshmellow, pistachio macarons and peach, and chocolate lollipop?  They gave us a nice parting gift of meringue cookies with nuts (although they tasted a little stale)."
1,"Went here a few weeks ago for my yearly (happened last 3 years ago...ha) skin scan. Large comfortable waiting area with TV's, though didn't wait long. Had a lot of questions and the Doctor was very helpful. Thorough and informative. Nurses followed up sooner than expected on the results. Place is a little tricky to find. If you're using mapquest or the map app, it's a little off, so make sure you go through the Firefighter Rd. intersection (coming from Uptown area) and take the next right into the complex...2630 building is all the way in the back."
0,I was looking for a cleaners who could clean and restore a child's dress that is 46 years old.  Whoever answered hung up on me the first time and said she couldn't hear me.  The second time she was just plain out rude and I asked who she was and were they in the business of getting new business or was she having a bad day and she hung up on me again.  Totally unacceptable!!!  This person couldn't even answer a question civilly.\n  \nSylvia S.
0,If you love your pet and dont have any knowledge on how to care for them when they are ill please dont go to this place ! Go to a place that cares about animals and that is knowledgeable on treatment. They told us that our puppy had the begining stages of parvovirus and that it would be 1800 to treat him for it if we left him in their care.(Dont leave your pets with them !) I opted for a second opinion and they still charged almost 50 dollars just for walking in ! (They know what they can do with that !) The service was as if i was a second class citizen which i am by Euro standards but I'm in no way as ignorant as this staff. I got my puppy taken care of by an elderly lady at the pet store on Broadway between central and 7th. Im disgusted by people who are only out to make a quick buck at the expense of someones care for their pets ! (P.S.) They wont even mention that Tamiflu will save your puppy from parvovirus but the humane society will !
1,"I was on vacation in Las Vegas as I normally do once to twice a year. I do all the normal stops that Hawaii peeps do, which includes going to Trader Joes.\n\nI noticed a nail salon in the same strip mall and I wondered how much it would cost to re-do my gelish nails. I walked in and was pleasantly greeted by Elan.  I paid $40 which I would I have paid $45 in Hawaii. \n\nElan was able to do my nails without a wait time. I left it up to her to choose what she wanted to do with my nails. I did tell her that I did not want it too bling, just a little bling. \n\nI was totally impressed with her choice of color and bling; 15 days later my nails still look great (of course with a little growth). I did tell her that I wanted a fade so the nail growth would not be so obvious. \n\nI will definitely will be back there the next time I am in Las Vegas."
1,I love this firehouse!! Friendly staff and delicious food! Very clean too. I got the turkey bacon ranch sub...sooo good! Make sure to try some of their house sauce with your sub!  Delish!
1,"The show is great!  There's no new, ground-breaking magic here.  You will have a fun time and enjoy the magic.  I thought I had seen enough magic shows to me \""magic-ed out.\""  But, Hammer is such a genial and funny guy that you just sit back, laugh, and enjoy every moment of this show.\n\nHammer engages the audience and he has a very quick mind.  Last night's show was attended mostly by tourists in Las Vegas.  It's always fun to watch tourists participating in shows like this.  What happens here goes home in photos taken by friends and family members.\n\nWhile there are a few double entendre references, the show is good for almost all ages.  You will enjoy yourself if you see this show.  Hammer is a very talented guy!"
0,"I have eaten at Del Friscos at least three times, due to friends birthday dinners and have never had a good experience. The service is always slow the food is never cooked right. I ordered the bone in filet this very last time and it was extremely fatty definitely not a good cut. We were even told our cab was outside waiting for us towards the end of dinner and in fact it was not. This place really needs to get it together and I do not understand the excellent reviews this restaurant gets. the only thing we enjoyed here was the lemon cake. \n\nTo be honest this restaurant is at the same level as Outback Steakhouse. The only plus is that the noise level wasn't too loud so you can actually conduct a little business during dinner. With so many options in Las Vegas I will never return to the steak house no matter which occasion it may be."
0,"Waited in line for an hour. Then another 15-20 after placing order for 1 cookie and a red velvet cupcake. Cookie was average, cupcake was dry and bland. Lots of hype but did not deliver for us."
1,"I would say, this place is in the top three restaurants in Copa. We decided to eat dinner here last night. This place is a hidden gem. From the greeting you receive when you walk in from a nice lady from Scotland to the outstanding service by our waitress Brooklynn. The decor was nice and comfortable. The food came pretty quick and it was amazing. I had the chicken fried steak, mash potatoes and veggies. I also had a salad on the side. The meal was huge like their menu. I even ate all of my veggies. The only thing I see was the salads were overloaded with croutons. The price was also reasonable. The drink prices were a little\n higher than normal. Overall a great experience. We have to come back and check out Breakfast. I've heard great things about it and my family will be regulars at this spot."
1,"This review is for a visit and not a stay. I thought this was a fun casino here at the rio, it's off the main strip but worth a visit!     \nI liked the I-Bar (we had full table service here for a birthday party so all i could drink was covered and top shelve...even better!!) bartenders and servers were all nice.\nEnjoyed the world buffet, many choices of food here. The buffet attracts crowds here so expect a wait in line.\nThe mardi gras flying floats are a lot of fun, and i had a great time at the rooftop club \""Voodoo Lounge\"" great views but pricey up there.\nAll in all i enjoyed my time here and even left with a little more money then i arrived with,\neven better!!"
1,The turkey burger is divine with tasty herb seasoning.....no ketchup was needed! Also loved the deep fried pickles:)  It's nice to have a local restaurant in the neighborhood that isn't a national chain.  Divine Eatery was recommended by a friend and we're glad we checked it out.  Love the homemade fries too!
1,Fun friendly servers and pretty good food! They are known for burgers but their salads are really good too!
0,"Pretty bad. Wait staff nice and friendly but too bad for them the food they serve is barely edible. I had \""3 farm fresh egg omelet\"" made with fake eggs. The hash browns tasted really awful--like freezer burned. And the worst part? Double what you'd pay at a bob Evans. My advice is to grab a bagel and yogurt at the hotel, a cup of Starbucks and you'll come out way ahead."
1,Jade Mountain has delicious bubble tea! I recommend the fruit teas (ordered cold). The veggie ramen is lovely as well-- quite a big portion for $5.50.
0,"The restaurant is a relaxing space. And, I appreciate the 10 under $10 lunch idea. It would be useful, however, for the wine list to be clear that the 8 oz. glasses of house wines run $12. I had two glasses, my friend one, and just like that we had a $36 liquor bill. I had an ahi tuna skewer. It was ok - not much flavor. The stir fried vegetables were very salty. My friend order salmon cakes but a different salmon dish arrived. Overall, my feeling is that I could have spent $65.00 elsewhere for a far nicer experience."
1,"Cheesesteaks were great, service could smile more."
1,"FULL DISCLOSURE: I watch Food Network, I enjoy Iron Chef, and some might consider me a \""Foodie\"" (of course, I got super-excited about the Doritos Locos Taco at Taco Bell, so take that for what you will).\n\nFOOD:\nI have been here twice now and both times have been excellent, easily within the top 3 meals I've ever tasted. The most wonderful thing there that I put in my face was the mushroom-fontina quesadilla, which was topped with ricotta, salsa verde, a fried egg, and garnished with cilantro. IT IS AMAZING. I've also tasted the Chorizo Meatballs - why is this not a full entree with pasta?; the ribeye - So much flavor; the filet mignon - it just melts in your mouth; the Yucatan Chicken Tacos - grilled chicken, grilled, onions, mint, cilantro, and a delicious peanut chile BBQ sauce; the roasted corn side dish - just wow. I've also had some other previous sides and appetizers from my previous visit, which were all extremely tasty. Oh!, and the bread basket they bring to the table has a jalapeno cheese bread, raisin molasses (I think), and a spicy cornbread muffin.\n\nDRINKS:\nI've had a couple tequila and whisky based cocktails, and all were great. This last time I had a rye whiskey cocktail that had champagne and orange peel, which was one of the better whiskey drinks I've had.\n\nSERVICE: Attentive and professional."
1,Lisa is always very professional and accommodating. My dog loves her and everything is always perfect when I get back. I had used someone else I found on Yelp before Lisa and would get back from a trip and my dog would need to be taken out immediately and would poop three times before coming back inside. Not the case with Pick of the Litter! I can tell my dog has been well walked and loved on while I was gone. It's nice being able to leave knowing my fur baby is ok. Lol!

I prefer more flavor in my BBQ (and not the flavor added from a store-bought bottle). \n\nI think their menu is WAY over priced for the amount of food you receive. If I am going to pay $2+ for a side, I expect to get more then a thimbles worth of food. I tried their BBQ sandwich and all I could say was, \""where's the beef?\"" The interior layout is confusing and seating is like a banquet hall (ick). \n\nEvery time I drive by, I see hoards of people clamoring in line to get below average tasting food and pay ridiculous prices. I guess sheep like food that lacks flavor. Since I do not live in Memphis, I settle for Famous Dave's BBQ (yes I know it's not Memphis BBQ, that's why I said \""settle\""). Tastes better. Priced better. Portions are bigger. I leave feeling satisfied.\n\nHonestly, you are better off saving for a trip to Memphis so you can eat your way thru the city and feel very good about yourself!"
0,"My beau and I have had horse back riding on our couples To Do list for a very long time now. He found the groupon deal where the ride was half off. We were excited about finally riding horses and when we arrived . . . well . . .\n\nFirst of all: the place we went was in a middle of no where. There was no clear place  to park and check in however there were other groups as well so we followed the crowd. We were greeted by a young lady at a table. We signed a paper when she disclosed that there is a mandatory gratuity of $15 per person. She first told us that she left a message. We did not receive the message until after the fact but we were already annoyed that the the gratuity was not stated in the groupon AND that they tell us on the day of the ride that we would have to pay.\n\nNext was the assignment of horses. You would think that before assigning you a horse that they would ask you on how experienced you are with horses as well as your size. The woman doing the assignments pretty much gave us the first available horse they had. One man in another group was assigned a horse who was known to have a bad temperament and kicked tailgating horses. It probably did not help that one of the cow boys got bit by that very horse while he was trying to take something out of it's mouth. The cowboy basically cussed and slapped the horse on the face WITH a guest saddled on. Not good at all in my book. (More on this later.) \n\nNext they forced us to line up with our groups to take a picture. First of all we told one of the women that we were not interested because we were not about to drop another 10 bucks on a photo print. Especially since my boyfriend had a cannon 2ti around his neck. If you are not a photographer, it is waaaay better than the crappy point and shoot they wanted to use. Luckily one of the younger workers there took our picture with our awesome camera. The woman in charged was clearly pissed off and forced us to take another picture with her point and shoot.\nwe started the ride once the woman in charge stopped screaming at the workers about how people were not saddled up correctly. We were led by a cowboy who forced everyone to ride single file. The problem was that the horses did not want to remain in single file. A couple in front of us wanted to remain together but the cowboy insisted that the horses decide who they want to ride with. The tour led us around a neighborhood rather than into the mountains as the website leads you to believe. At one point my horse began to tailgate that one angry horse from earlier. That horse kicked my horse who nearly threw me into one of the dumpsters. None of the workers helped me nor did they apologize for the incident.\n\nThe entire tour was a disappointment and unprofessional on the part of the staff. I hardly rode nor saw my boyfriend the entire two hours plus we were there. At the end of our tour they called us over for the dinner that comes with the plan. We were so over this place that we just got in our car and drove away.\n\nThis place gets one star: for the kid who took our picture with OUR camera. At least we got a decent picture of our adventure."
0,"This review is for a takeout order (hotel room dining at its finest). See their menu and prices at ruths-chris.com. I ordered a ribeye ($43) cooked medium rare with a peppercorn sauce (au poivre) ($4) and served with bread and butter. All this was nicely individually packed but be careful though as I had a bit of leakage. Servers were polite. \n\nThe steak itself was definitely quality meat and my first bite was golden.  The steak was definitely cooked to the right temperature.  This is where the review goes downhill. My second peace I tried with the peppercorn sauce which was not appetizing. As a steakhouse I expected the sauce to complement the meat and not mask it entirely. Finally, with each additional bite the meat tasted saltier until I finally just accepted that they had over salted the meat. A bit too salty to enjoy. In addition, there were a lot of chewy pure fat parts to my steak making it difficult to eat and cut--albeit with a plastic knife."
0,"It was very tasty, but the resulting food poisoning makes me never want to eat there again.\n\nThe last thing I wanted for my birthday was to be stuck in my hotel for 2 days throwing up."
1,One of the most entertaining shows. Great mix of comedy and acrobatics. There aren't any bad seats but I think if you pay for the VIP seating you might interact with the host a little more aka picked on. \n\nThis definitely isn't a kid friendly show. There aren't  any nudity but unless you enjoy prude humor I wouldn't recommend going. The stage is extremely small and all the action is right in front of you. Its roughly 90 minutes long and I enjoyed every second of it. I will definitely be going back to see if some of the audience interaction was staged because I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.
0,"I've debated about my review for a few weeks now.  Unfortunately, the hairdressers don't seem to really  be very well versed in blow outs.  I used to have curly hair (I have the keratin treatment now), so I  know exactly how to work a round brush.  When I saw the type of brush they were going to use the first time I went, I knew it was not going to be good.  After I left, I went to the Mall and the girl with the flat iron fixed it for me.  If it wasn't because of the Groupon,  I would have never gone on my own.  For $35 I expect a better job than what I can do.  The girls are really nice and that is the only reason why I added the extra star."
0,"You know, I really wanted to like this place. My boyfriend and I have driven by many times, but never had a chance to stop in until today.\n\nWhen we walked in there was a gentleman (possibly the owner??) sitting at the host stand doing a crossword - he stopped promptly and seated us. \n\nThe atmosphere was cute, we sat outside on the patio and looked over the paper menu while we waiting for our server (you think they could afford to at least laminate the things). When our server came I asked about the Over Easy Ice (basically an iced coffee with sweetened condensed milk and spices) and he pretty much had no clue what I was talking about - he didn't know the menu at all.\n\nWe started with the raz cranberry scone with vanilla bean creme freche. It came to the table drizzled in honey and had a huge mound of the cheese on it. As soon as I took a bite I was dissapointed. The scone was stale, like, second day stale. What a bummer, especially because it totally had the potential to be really amazing.\n\nI ordered the mushroom scallion cheese omelette. It was something you would find a Denny's for a lot less. Greasy, greasy, greasy. My boyfriend got the smoked salmon with asparagus - he liked it. His meal was pretty much the only good thing on the table. He got the sourdough toast, which came dry without any butter - not even on the side. It was left untouched on the table.\n\nWhat a let down. With their hip signage and atmosphere, this place could be so much better than it is.\n\nAnd for heaven's sake - use fresh scones!!!"
0,Decent pad thai. They had their kids in the restaurant and they were loud.
0,This place is garbage! The dim sum is cold and the taro taste like ammonia. Stay away from this restaurant.
1,Kelly is awesome! She took the time to hear about what I wanted and did a precise job. Love it.  Thank you Kelly
0,"Walked into this place, did the tour, and walked right back out.\nMachines, smokey, no beers on tap, and just a generally uninviting atmosphere. No one bothered to comment as I passed through, left and headed to Steiners a mile away. \nNo thanks."
0,"When we ordered we got two sandwiches, fries, Greek fries, bread sticks, soda and a pizza. The first issue was my girlfriend ordered with an out of state phone number and they almost refused to let us order. \n\nTook 20 minutes to place an order. They didn't have any diet soda of any kind. When we got the food the sandwiches were soggy and bland. I asked for no onions but they were still on it anyway. The pizza reminded me if I would have gotten Pizza Hut, kept it on the counter for three days and then microwaved it. It was horrible. \n\nThe breadsticks were hard and stale tasting and the fries were very limp. It's almost as I'd they just reheated old fries instead of making us new ones. Needless to say I am never getting this pizza again."
0,"Most vile, disgusting breakfast I've ever had. Shit House a Go-Go is a great big no no. I was so mad when I left at being ripped off by this nasty place. Cold, huge portions of very bad food."
0,"Staff was very rude. We did not have reservations. I should have called prior to our visit but  it was a last minute decision and we used to stay at the hotel when we did not live in N.C. The manager was at the entrance and asked if we had a reservation. I said no. He said sorry they were booked. No problem we could come back later. However looking at the restaurant 1/2 of the restaurant was empty. The bar was beside the restaurant. My husband asked if we could get a drink in the bar. The mananger said yes. Went to the bar, once again open tables everywhere and surprise we are offered the dinner menu.. The bar and the restaurant are basically the same room. It is a shame! They really seemed to not want our business. Food is good, hotel is lovely but the staff ruined it all!"
0,"Great service, but this is honestly the worst food I have ever eaten out at a restaurant in my life. I dont suggest going here for food EVER (maybe for the drink specials and hookah but nothing else)."
0,"This is a mediocre pizza place.  Edible, but not great.  I won't throw a hissy-fit going here, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find this place."
1,"Things that are awesome about Maizies:\n\n- $5 glasses of Sangria that are really quite tasty\n- Their Boneless Buffalo Dip, which tastes like buffalo wings dipped in cheese sauce, but comes in dip format with tortilla chips and pita wedges for dipping. our server suggested it and I can see why it is so popular. Melted cheesy deliciousness\n- The owner has been in every time I've been there. He asks how you are enjoying everything and thanks you for coming. I think he might drink there every night (probably what I would do if I owned a restaurant). I don't really know him, so I don't know if he's a good guy or not, but I appreciate when the guy at the top actually spends time making sure everything is working.\n- The burgers with the toppings inside are good and only $3 on Monday evenings. \n- They have a huge list of salads\n\nThings that aren't so awesome:\n- It's pretty busy here all the time (wait, maybe this should go in the awesome category)\n- The salads come in bowls exactly the same as we had growing up - meaning the same size that my mother would use to feed a family of four. It feels a little gluttonous and salad doesn't really keep until the next day if there's dressing on it, so it's hard to take the leftovers home.\n\nThose are really my only complaints. I've been here a couple of times and Hannah (not sure if that's spelled correctly) has been the server every time. She is really helpful. I feel like I needed to give public props to her for that - I imagine other people like her as well."
0,"We had the Orange Chicken, the sweet n sour chicken, Pad Thai, dinners specials  and some sauce added to kick it up a notch.\n\nWe decided to eat here on a whim just because..well the Yelp reviews looked appealing...\n\nThe food arrived in a timely manner, the delivery guy was cool. So we tipped him well. :-) fast forward to opening the bag, and wham! Guess what we found? A damn mess! Thinking of starting a hashtag with #littledump  as a result. \n\nIt was like going to work ER at the emergency room. The containers were all heavily sauced as they had been thrown around like basketballs. Check out the pictures of the attempted triage of the nasty situation here if you want. \n\nThis was outrageous and we really thought that people should know what they're getting to go from here.\n\nWe called and let them know and they acted at first like it was no biggie and said thanks for calling. Then later called to offer 10% off the next order. Thanks, but no thanks."
0,"As others have explained, you avoid fees by having to take a 2nd shuttle from the Consolidated Rental Facility.  At the office you have to sign a statement that you did not arrive from the airport via the rental facility's shuttle.  They obviously are skirting the law. The 2nd problem we encountered is the clerks try very hard to sell you all sorts of unnecessary insurance coverage."
1,"far far away from the strip, you wouldn't expect to find a quality hotel/resort/casino buffet...but that is exactly what you get at studio b.  i don't know if i'll go as far as to say that it can top an excursion to the wynn, but with half the wait time, it's well worth it.\n\nhaving once been a connoisseur of the vegas buffets, i appreciate the value of a well designed layout and variety of cuisine to choose from.  at the end of the day, every buffet will serve the same types of food...carving station, salads, sushi, americanized asian/italian/random country with a distinct palate, soups, an occasional seafood feast and dessert.  so it's fair to say that it's difficult to stand out in the buffet world of las vegas.\n\nbut that being said, studio b is successful in attracting a loyal crowd of diners and visitors.  it also doesn't hurt that m resort played host to top chef las vegas."
0,"SLOWEST SERVICE IN PHOENIX, GREAT BLOODY MARY MIX, SALTY, STALE FOOD, WHAT A WASTE!\n\n--EXCELLENT bloody mary, and for $2 special, Sat-Sun 11a-3p! One star (up from zero) for an excellent drink. THAT'S IT.\n\n--walked in to find a customer at the podium waiting to complain about being abandoned at his patio table for the last 30 minutes\n--waited 15 minutes for our first round of drinks in the bar\n--when our party joined us and we sat, waited 10 minutes to have our drink order taken;\n--25 more minutes for our drinks to arrive (we insisted she take our order before leaving);\n--food arrived more than _one hour_ after ordering\n--the scrambled eggs were crusty and old, obviously made hours earlier; we were too hungry and pissy to send them back -- GET ME THE HELL OUT OF HERE!\n--the lobster bits and their sauce were nothing but salt!

1,"I started going to Spice Island when it first opened. I was in my early 20s then, which means the place is officially a Pittsburgh institution. The menu has stayed pretty much the same over the years, with the exception of adding alcohol, but why change a good thing? My favorite items on the menu are vegetarian -- the fried tofu (either sauce is delicious) and the vegetable curry trio. Pay a little extra for the coconut rice and you'll be back for the same thing again and again."
0,"I love the food here but service is clearly an issue.\n\nWent to eat here with my boyfriend and it's like they forgot about us.  There were only two tables in the restaurant, and people were coming in and placing orders to go.  About three of these to go orders that were made after us were given out before they decided to cook ours.\n\nWe arrived with plenty of time to eat but because of this we got our food very close to closing time, and felt like we had to rush to eat.  Not cool.  The food was great, but the service ruined the experience for us.  We're not terribly picky people or anything either."
0,"It's rare that I leave myself enough time to have breakfast before schlepping to work, but today happened to be one of those days (purely by accident (aka stupid garage door drama) I assure you!) so I head over to the McD's and order a #1 (Egg McMuffin) w/ a chocolate chip frappe...\n\nLet's get this straight, right out the box...there are 4 stars for the frappe and my crispy delicious potato and negative 2 stars for the McMuff due to the dried up crusty piece of gristly canadian bacon and the not fully cooked egg...gross! \n\nG'bye protein! So I ended up with a grilled cheese english muffin...\n\nI guess I should in some way thank them for pushing me one step closer to being the vegetarian I occasionally toy with becoming. My stomach is still churning at the memory of wet egg in my mouth. *hork*"
0,"Tourist. Trap.\n\nMy gf and I were suckered in by the \""Buy one, get one\"" sign. We walked in, were waited on at the bar, and walked out with two yards of alcohol infused slush. I hardly believe the \""alcohol infused\"" part though. Total waste of money at an inflated price."

1,"I like many others have a difficult schedule, and am only able to do things, like get my nails done at night. I yelped 24hr nail salons and Elaines popped up first. I read the reviews and decided to try it out. Let me say, one of the best pedicures Ive had in a while. She only takes appointments after 8pm but when i walked in at about 1030pm she was more than happy to give me service. She was so friendly and it was nice because since I was the only customer at the time I felt she really was able to take her time. It was $25 but worth every cent. She exfoliated my legs as well as scrubbed my feet with the pumas bar and the grater. Massaged my legs with lotion after everything was said and done. AWESOME AWESOME service. Only going there from now on for my pedicures."
0,"I want to give this hotel a decent rating for two reasons. First, because the housekeeping staff was responsive and delightful and also because the \""renovated room\"" I stayed in did actually seem to be recently redone and it was fairly clean. These two points are the only reason I am not giving one star, because everything else about the hotel was awful. The hotel lobby and attached casino were dirty, old, and rather creepy which, of course, attracted dirty, creepy clientele. There were never enough staff members at the front desk so the line was always impossibly long and I witnessed outbursts by rude guests on several occasions. This is not the place I would ever recommend coming for productive business trips or relaxing pleasurable vacation. Yuck!"
1,"This is my go-to breakfast/brunch place when I'm staying in Montreal. It has your basic breakfast menu and serves delicious eggs benedict (if that's what you're into), crepes, fruit, and other typical breakfast offerings. I don't see why people have hated on this restaurant. It's nothing spectacular, just a great, cheap place to get breakfast. I wouldn't go there for dinner, but they do have a good pasta carbonara. If you're looking for dinner, head up the block a little toward Edoardo's. It has DELICIOUS pasta dishes for a totally affordable price."
0,This dog park is for the locals only. No shade during the day. Busted sprinkler heads make huge mud pits so you can look forward to giving your dog a bath when you get home. If you want to see photos of this park and look for some much better parks in the area go to dogparkriot.com.
0,"This placement doesn't even deserve a star so I guess one will do. The only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess, after that everything else went downhill. My server was very untidy and she took forever to get my food. She looked like she had just finished her day shift at a pizza shop and forgot to change her dirty apron which was caked with white dust. Brought me a meal different from what I ordered and didn't have the guts to apologize for it. The food came on a skillet which was supposed to be sizzling but it was cold. Very unappetizing with overlooked onions and a very tiny piece of meat. Place wasn't that busy so I fail to understand why it took over 30 min to get my food. And it looked like a dog had passed on the food then it was brought to me. When she asked me how the food was, I told her that it wasn't what I ordered and she just rolled her eyes. I was tired and didn't want to start fussing with her so I just paid and left. But one thing I can commend about the restaurant is the fact that when I requested for my check, it came in less than 30 seconds. This is the worst Applebee's experience I've ever had in my life and I don't think I ever want to go to an Applebee's if this is the kind of service I get. Over to you Mr. Applebee's CEO."
0,"-soggy rubbery crepe\n-cheap oj, tastes like minute maid\n-Potatoes gratin tastes cheap with a Mac n cheese flavor\n\nI wanted something classic so I got the maple cream crepe with coffee and oj and a side of Potatoes. Maple syrup wasn't high quality. I won't be back."
1,"Good experiences here! Keep up the good work, friendly staff, tasty food.. I'll be back. I like bringing people here who haven't been, it's a great place. Easy to get to and great to sit out and have a good meal while we talk for a while. Good drinks too!"
0,"I've been going to Rositas for probably 10-15 years and mainly at lunch during the work week. The tacos are great, the enchilads are chessy and taste good but also a gut bomb that makes you want to take a nap. Unfortunately this has always been one of my go to places and would normally give it 4 stars; however, I finally took the family this past Sunday and the food was OK not as good as usual and the service was awful. The waitress did not seem happy to be serving us, got one of the orders wrong (which we couldn't fix because we didn't see her for 20 more minutes), we got the tortillas for fajitas 20 minutes after the fajitas and the check took another 20 minutes to wait for. I would typically go here every month but hadn't been in a 3-4 months so I am hoping this was a one off and the next visit will be better and not that the place has gone down hill."
0,"The kids had  fun, however there was a spat with one of the new guys. Kids are kids. Treat them fairly.  Don't let the other kids cut while my 2 were waiting for the bungee contraption. Then tell me he didn't see them there.  That put a damper in the adults fun,  but the kids didn't know any better. Chris C. I believe was awesome! Taught my kids how to flip and to jump high.  He alone gets 5 stars.  And did i mention how rude the pringles looking man was? Sir i asked you for 2 wrist bands for my kids.  I don't need you telling me it can't hold me because I'm not under 7. Just do what I, consumer, asked you for.  My next visit, i probably won't go back.  And by the way,  there isn't a dress policy? Since when little girls in short shorts and half tops/sports bras was legal? That's not the place fault,  but still you need a shirt little girl to jump.  That is all"
0,this is an interesting place i really enjoyed the customer service although they will a little busy to help me i do feel like the business has a fight chance due to the name greens and proteins but the problem is that their line has the potential of being run right out of the door. meaning there is no place to stand if the line gets too big. drinks are way over priced and really are nothing special. i haven't tasted their food yet but i imagine its the same as the smoothies. i am a fan but i don't think the business will last very long if you ask me.
0,"The boyfriend and I had a nice time here for a staycation. Another reveiwer worded it perfectly you can tell it used to be a Ritz but it needs some cleaning up, it feels old.  I thought the staff was friendly enough. I had reserved the room online and added the upgrade which they are supposed to let you know if you get the upgrade when you check in. They made no mention of it, but my boyfriend asked and we ended up paying more than what the online price was. It was only a couple dollars hardly worth mentioning since total bill was over $200 for one night + room service. \n\nSooo the room service...if you stay here DO NOT ORDER ROOM SERVICE. It was the worst meal of my life, fake smoke added to the bacon ruined everything on my plate and the eggs tasted like they were microwaved. The total bill was $60 for breakfast, strip prices, but at least the room service at most hotels on the strip is worth the premium. Again no point in complaining...my boyfriend will eat just about anything.\n\nThe bar in the hotel was fantastic, they made the best peach cosmo well worth the price! Very slow with the service though...The village is cute, didn't find much for food in the immediate area, however the cigar bar is definitely worth a visit. The casino was not much at all but somehow we still found our way there a few times during the night.  ONLY electronic dealers, come on now, but the BF did enjoy their selection of free beer while we were playing (losing). Overall might stay here again if we head out that way but need to save up $$$."

1,"Does this valley need another sub shop? No, it certainly doesn't. This seems to be a family-owned enterprise and the value is maybe just a wee bit better than the national franchises, so maybe it's not the first one I'd drive through if I happened to have a bulldozer at my disposal.\n\nIt's still just a sub though, and I thought this particular sandwich was in the style of Blimpie's. The bread is a little bit on the thick side, heavy on the lettuce that looks like it was run through a document shredder, plus a reasonable quantity of meat."
0,"I went for appetizers and happy hour, so this rating doesn't cover entrees or sliders, which were supposed to be good.\n\nThe appetizers are $5 for happy hour, which for the poke was fine but 3 tiny pieces of food is definitely not worth the $10 full price.  The \""nom nom dumplings\"" with pork and shrimp looked and tasted like they were stuffed with meatballs with thick dough that looked overcooked and didn't taste like dumplings.  Service was very slow and not very friendly."
0,"Good food...but the service when doing 'carry out' orders is quite slow. Give yourself an extra 20 mins or so after they say it'll be ready. I know this place is popular, so maybe that's why I guess. Anyway, maybe someone else will have a better experience. (Please note this review was based on a few experiences throughout this past spring/summer and could of been resolved by now, I just wanted people to be aware of the possibility)"
0,Went for my bridal hair and makeup and was extremely disappointed! Worst job ever had to go to my room and redue it all myself! The bill came out to be $200 more then what I was quoted because of all the up sale and the employees were very rude and unprofessional!

0,"The problem is $5 for a 12 ounce glass of domestic beer. Really? 5$ ?  The food is just so so, and also overpriced. 15$ for little baby sliders? Do these greed mongrels think they are in NYC?"
1,I absolutely love this place! Awesome decor and great service! I ordered the Single Bypass burger and split it with a friend! I enjoyed the music videos and the awesome hospital gowns! This place is definitely crossed off my to do list! =D
0,I went to Michael Kors to  shop the jewelry section for a Christmas gift. The sales clerk named Linda took a sentry stance  front of  of me and the jewelry  case and refused to speak to me. Apparently this sales clerk does not consider an ethnic person such as myself a viable customer. I live in North Scottsdale and I'm sure I make more money than a sales clerk.
1,"Fast, friendly crew. ESPECIALLY on a Monday morning!"
1,"Wife and I each had the 4 course / $45 special. Serving sizes of the apps were slightly reduced, but we still couldn't finish everything, so still plenty of food. And the variety was great, especially for the price. \n\nGumbo, BBQ shrimp, bacon, & Cesar salad were as good as any dishes I've had anywhere. Dining at the bar was great as was the service and pace. The peach chicken was juicy & flavorful like dark meat but was a meaty breast -- I never order chicken for a nice dinner out, but this was really good and would recommend. \n\nDid I mention the roasted bacon appetizer? They use thick and lean cuts, apply brown sugar and cayenne pepper then roast. Served with a maple dipping sauce - really unique and so good. Was a tad on the spicy side but worked for me. \n\nIf there was anything that wasn't a '10', I'd say the skirt steak. It was very good and lean and flavorful but I've had that elsewhere. Since it was 'only' an 8, it really underscored how great the rest of the dishes were. \n\nFinished with chocolate mousse which was also very good - wife had lemon bar which she said was top notch. \n\nWe may not stay at Venetian next visit to Las Vegas, but we will absolutely come for dinner at Table 10 -- it was great. Emeril came out of New Orleans and his roots and passion for this style of cooking come though 1000% at Table 10."
0,Worst hotel I've ever been to. Dirty room (suit) really bad service and no one gives a fuck about your complains...\nNow lying in my bed and realized the TV does not work .... Never ever again ... Service as beeing on an festival for lots of bucks....
0,"Negative 10 stars! \nThis place was unbelievably trashy!!! \n1) People walking/ danicing around barefoot. WTF?! \n2) Asian male bartender who thought he was cool as shit, he was anything but\n3) Drinks were pretty f'ing gross. \n4) Complete waste of time and money."
1,"Pizza was delicious, one of my new favorites!"
0,Bad place for breakfast the bill was pricy and the food was ok but not the greatest!
1,"The location is right on... across the street from UNCC and next store to Brueggers, I have spent many of nights cramming for a test or getting my caffeine fix before work. Since this Starbucks is very small and always busy you have to keep you eye on a table and pounce when one comes available. The baristas are my favorite in Charlotte, they have pretty much memorized my order. They're speedy and always friendly. Good thing Starbucks is building a larger location in the same shopping center."
1,"Everything was fresh!!!!!! I had the prime rib and it was good.  Loved the hot crab legs,raw oysters, sushi, peel and eat shrimp, lobster bisque, lobster mac n cheese.  Got there at 6pm so line was fine.  Ate so much crab im actually tired of it. Husband loved it too."
0,"Don't send your teenage daughters in to this place, they quoted them $ 10 and demanded $ 20, they use their lack of English skills to confuse and rip people off."
0,"Way overpriced drinks, with my vodka martini starting at $17 and wasn't even evenly balanced.  The only plus side is the more than abundant staff trying to get you to drink more, so you'll never have to hunt one of them down."
1,"In my constant quest to find good bagels in AZ I came across Big City and figured I'd give them a shot.  The bagels are great!  Again, the salt bagels here don't have the rocky salt that I'm used to but this place does a nice job.  The salt, everything, poppy and onion are delicious and they have a Hawaiian, which I didn't think would be good but I ended up loving it (it has coconut and I think pineapple).  The cream cheese is very good and they put the right amount on, at least for my taste.  I like the fact that these aren't the pale bagels you mostly see out here, these are crispy outside with a nice toasty brown color.\n\nHusband loves the weekend omelet sandwich.  Convenient location and parking - major plus.  I take bagels to go each time and I freeze them - these defrost and toast up great, another plus."
1,Came here to get a flow master exhaust put on my husbands new truck. Service was fast! In and out less than 45 min. Total $210. The guys there were nice. Family owned business.
0,The staff is rude.  never get the order correct.
1,"This Hotel is gorgeous! I stayed here for my 21st Birthday weekend and had a blast. I definitely think it's better to go with the One Bedroom suite because you get this awesome jetted tub in the bedroom! The window shade comes down and you are able to turn the TV into a projection screen. Which is great for sports! The full kitchen was also amazing. I love being able to warm up my leftovers from a delicious Vegas restaurant. It also gives it a more homey vibe. The downside? No smoking = ( That's the only thing that I wish was different. The pool is beautiful and relaxing. It's not as crowded as some of the other hotels, which is a good thing. The prices of the rooms are pretty good too. Especially for the location. To stay in a Planet Hollywood Deluxe Room is almost the same price and you get so much more!"
1,"Holsteins shakes are like a spiked milkshake ! They have really great creations and they were so good ! I recommend the Frozen Grasshopper or the Drunken Monkey. These are delicious !!! \n\nFrom there, we went on and had a few apps on the menu. The Lobster Mac and Cheese, Lobster rolls, sliders, and the bruschetta. Everything was AMAZING except for the crab bruschetta. Took a small bite and passed the plate. The only think I would say about this is that the bartender didn't take it off our bill. We did state that it was not good and shouldn't be recommended to people but it's an $18 app so I guess upselling is where this came in. I'm going to continue on how great everything else was though. The Lobster Mac and Cheese and Lobster Rolls were dynamite ! The size of actual lobster in these small plates were terrific and so so good ! The mini sliders were great too ! The staff and bartender we had was really nice ! \n\nHighly recommend this place ! At least if you're passing by, just go for the shakes !"
0,"The rooms are poopy. \n\nThere is no cable television, the shampoo was latherless and the conditioner wasn't much better. The rooms are on the tiny/cramped side and the soda machine only took singles.\n\nThese may not seem like big issues but when you're nursing a massive hangover and barely alive you need:\n\nA comfy room- to nurse yourself back to \""functional\"" \n\nA satisfying shower - because they always make you feel 90% better.\n\nTo stay hydrated- When you can barely make it to the bathroom, going down to Casino Level is not an option. The soda machine by the ice machine is your only hope. When you make the exhausting trek down the hall only to have your $5 bill rejected by said soda machine, well that's just a whole new level of pain.\n\nEntertainment- this is where the TV comes in. You may not THINK you'll spend enough time in your room to care, but you will. When every fiber of your body (including your hair) aches and your bound to your sickbed until your \""second wind\"" comes around, entertainment is indispensable. I'm not picky, I don't need premium cable. A TBS movie marathon would suffice but Paris Hotel offers only Vegas tourist info TV and about 20 random channels in Korean:  \n\nMy hangovers and I will stay elsewhere from here on out, but I'll probably still come here pre-hangover to drink and gamble since I do really dig the casino..."
1,"When they say the spin class is a party on a bike they are not lying! I have not taken a spin class here that I have not enjoyed. The instructors are soooo much fun and I really enjoy how they each put their own \""spin\"" on the class. I love the building, its beautiful! I also really enjoy the SEED cafe but however charging 7 dollars for a protein shake it a little pricey, but it is delicious! I also feel for me its a bit pricey for the class but they do offer a student/teacher discount which makes it only 10 bucks a class, which keeps me, a student coming back for more fun on the bike! Be prepared to feel like you just got out of the club at 9 am in the morning! I love it though becuase i feel it starts my day off on a high!"
1,"Treasures always treat me right. I enjoy the girls and the music, when ever friends of mine come in town I recommend them, I have been to my share of strip clubs in Vegas in this one seems to be the most enjoyable. I normally take the free limo that they offer, but to get the free limo you have to get two drinks when you get to the club so thirty dollars for a limo ride no cover and two drinks. I wouldn't go to early it's pretty dead between 5 and 8pm at least the days I have been, which I have been during the week and the weekends. The girls range from all different types, it's one hell of a strip club for what I have experienced,"
0,"If I could review the food separately from the service, then my review would be much more glowing.  On the 3 times that we've attempted to dine here the service has consistently been pretty painful.  I had to wait 30 minutes and ask 4 times to get my diet coke delivered to the table, after our first round of food was on the table.  They offer an all you can eat Simon-style brunch on the weekend, which turns out to be all you can wait.  Service is consistently not remotely fast or organized.  At the brunch, they often forget some of our orders that never arrive and servers are hard to flag down for drink refills or ordering.\n\nOn my last visit as I washed my hands in the ladies room a female server busted through the door stuffing her face with a pastry over the bathroom sink.  Their kitchen whips up some pretty yummy fare, but until Republic improves their service issues, we will not be returning."
1,"The atmosphere was great, this place use to be a bird sanctuary, the kept the birds when the turned it into a pub & bar. I love all the trees and birds. They have a roof top you can sit and drink, the food was really good and everything comes with tater tots. Prices are good for the portions. I'm going back and I recommend it."
0,"I quoted blinds from multiple locations and Bugsy beat the price. I was excited a company with great reviews for the best price.  They have been out to my house over 4x now to \""fix\"" broken blinds.  They use some cheap shit plastic grommet between the wood shutters and the pivot point.  If you open and close the shutters more than a few times you end up with broken slats.  I'm not saying they aren't friendly when they come to fix them... They are.  They have a ridiculously long guarantee.  I don't know how they can afford to come out to the same place so many times to fix the same problem.  I wish I had paid a tiny bit more for better quality blinds.  What a waste of time."
0,Poor service at the deck pool! Paid $10 to get in as locals and waited over 30 mins for anyone to see if we wanted food or drinks. We asked for a menu and no one ever came back to take our order. The pool could use more water so all the jets are not spraying water across the pool. Hope for better service at The Salted Lime for dinner cause starving after no service at the pool.
0,"ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous gym!!\n\ni hope the manager reads this. in fact i know the manager will read this. \n\nthis gym lacks professionalism in every corner possible! i hope everyone reads this before making their decision of going to this filth place! the manager beats behind the bush, avoiding any calls of complaint! the staff are horrible & need to be replaced! no care in providing customer service what so ever. & Daniel pathetic.... trying to only sell sell sell. who ever hired him must have not known the lack of experience he carries. lifetime, 24, la fitness are your best bets. run run run! this gym is again ridiculous and only wants your money.\n\ni hope i get a feedback on this because i would love to hear what you gotta say! thank you yelp for the opportunity to speak!"
1,"The place is a bit of a hole in the wall in a sketchy mini strip mall, but don't let that stop you. The food, for the most part is great. Skip the Falafel as that's pretty plain, frozen and deep fried. The gyro or gyro salad are both quality, so is the Chicken. Fries aren't the crispiest, but they'll do. Service is good, the owner is often behind the counter and is very friendly. I'd definitely recommend it."
0,This was my worse experience ever   I like to eat out frequently and thought I would try this new restaurant.  They don't know what real Mexican food is.  I could buy the same cans at the store for less.  Even the margaritas were nasty. Service slow for as many as seem to be there.  I want Mexican food I will go somewhere else.  Sorry don't think I will ever come back.
0,We were very disappointed in this restaurant as the other reviews and photos looked so good!  We went for breakfast and the portions were small and lacked flavor.  We will not go back.  We should have stuck with the hotel's buffet.
1,The joy we had bringing our daughter into this world was amplified by having Dr. Wareing see us through it. I can't recommend her enough.
1,"Yuuummmmy beeer!!\n\nI can not wait to get back to this place. Great selection and decent service. For instance, the regular staff is okay, but the owner and someone behind the bar who seemed close to him were just stellar. They will talk to you about what you like, what you are drinking and upcoming events.\n\nI will try the food next time, heard it's great."
0,Slowest drive thru and inside is just as bad! It's been bad for years. I don't understand why they can't get it together.
1,Quick and friendly service!
1,"Great selection and wide variety with good prices make this my new favorite Asian/international market in Madison! Store and items were clean and fresh. Variety of ethnicities-- I went home with Jamaican, Mexican, Indian, Arab, Thai, and Chinese foods/products in my bags! Near downtown and very close to the beltline make it easy to access, even if you're coming from out of town. Seems like the strip mall and library which share a parking lot with Yue-Wah has all been recently updated. Looks nice."
1,Awesome pizza in a pleasantly great  atmosphere  Short and Sweet! By far some of the best pizza I have ever had in my many travels across the United States!  Definitely WORTH a trip and a MUST to the scottsdale az
0,"The burrito is full of chicken but that is where it ends. there is minimal flavor and the food is overpriced, what do you expect in an airport. On a positive note the service was decent."
0,"Overpriced. Not the best carne asada fries, not even close! Nacho cheese on them instead of regular shredded cheese....doesn't make sense. We asked for no guacacmole and sour cream, still got it on our fries. Not coming back."
1,Open on a Sunday. Accepted walkins. Very accommodating. I was more scared than Luna. Dr Sibley and Chris loved on her. Kendra welcomed us. I didn't know what to expect since this was my first ever vet appt with my very first pet. Examination and shots were done on the floor where Luna was most comfortable. Didn't even need the table. Shots were a breeze. Very affordable for the reboosters. Will return to give the fecal. Four stars- no treat after the shots? Guess I should've brought my own
0,"I have gone to this Firestone location twice for oil changes in my Mustang.  The first time, I got no sticker indicating the month / mileage I needed to get another oil change at.  I didn't notice until I got home.  It's full synthetic so not that big a deal -- annoying but I just marked the calendar in my blackberry to remind me a few months down the road.  \n\nThe second time, the tech had oil on his boot and when he put his feet on the drivers side floormat to bring the vehicle back around after the oil change, he got oil all over it.  I was on the phone when I got back in the vehicle and, again, didn't notice.  My loss, because it's permanently stained. I had the floormats professionally shampooed afterwards but it didn't help.    Fortunately, it was just the floormat, not the actual carpet.\n\nTwo careless and annoying mistakes in two visits = two stars and no third chance."
0,"Found this salon while going to another store in the area.  The first time I went the young guy did a great job.  He was very skilled.  The next time I went he was busy with another customer.  So, as I was exhausted and in need of a fill and pedicure, I had 2 different ladies working on me at the same time.  The pedicure was great!  But the fill itself was ok, but the filing at the tips of my nails left a lot to be desired. The next day I was at work and noticed one of my nails was filed at an odd angle.  Then I started comparing them all side by side and saw that they were all filed at different angles.  I was not a happy camper.  I chose not to call and complain because I figured it would be useless."
1,"Their technicianwas atmy housewithin 45 minutes ofmy callin SanTan Valley.  Jeremy was friendly,  quick and efficient.  He knew the problem in minutes and the repairs were completed quickly. I had a cold house Weirton 1.5 hours from my call for repairs.  I got five star service, but gave them for stats because it was a bit pricey,  but for me it was worth it to not have to wait and have friendly service."
0,Don't know why this place gets busy. I felt sick eating my chicken yakisoba bowl so I threw it away. I'd rather go to the teriyaki places at a food court in a mall.
0,Had a terrible experience today. We were both willing to pay full price for shoes but the salesperson was disinterested and arrogant.  \nShe didn't care and it showed. I'll buy them elsewhere.
1,"Literally as good as it gets! I've been wanting to jumpstart my fitness and was looking for a different way to do so other than going to a regular gym where I felt intimidated and lost.  A friend recommended me to Chris at Pro Edge a few months ago and I've been hooked. \n\nI always attend Blackout Boxing and it absolutely is the best workout I give myself. Although it's a group class, Chris makes you feel like its one on one giving each of us individual attention to help correct our form or to be that voice to tell you that you can do this! \n\nChris' success is your success. Everyone is helpful, motivational and its just an all around fun, welcoming environment. He knows exactly what to do to push you, and shows you that you can go beyond your limits. I've also done buddy training which was killer! I survive each time and always walk out of that place wanting more and knowing results are on its way. \n\nI highly recommend Pro Edge if you are looking for a boxing gym where you not only get an awesome workout, but a place where you have a fit fam to encourage your goals and take you to the next level every time."
0,"Booked online (via a link from the conference I was attending) to make sure there would be room for me. Kinda thought $25 was high for a trip around the block, but OK, if that's the going rate.... But the door rate is $14.50! No coupon book. No refund. No legitimate excuse. Won't have my business again. Run away, far away, quickly!"
1,"I was going to give this Cirque show 3 stars. 3 STARS!!!  Yep. 5-star K.D. (I give everything 5 stars, everyone who reads my reviews knows this) WAS GOING TO GIVE A CIRQUE SHOW 3 STARS! \n\nThen I calmed down. \n\nFirst, some background about me, I love Cirque shows. No... I have an OBSESSION with Cirque shows. You know those people who watch Star Wars movies a hundred times? Well, I'm like that, except with Cirque shows. I could probably sing-along the entire Ka soundtrack and I don't even know what I'm saying! But I can sing it because I must've heard that soundtrack a hundred times.  \n\nSo... this Beatle's LOVE is a one and done deal for me. I bumped it up to a four stars because I read my Yelpie friends review of the show and they've convinced me it was a good show. Also the bf loved it and he'll kill me if he finds out I gave it 3 stars (it was our Valentines Day gift. Giving LOVE on Valentines, get it? Awwww).  \n\nFirstly, it's not a Cirque show. Outside of the few aerial acrobats, and the trampoline artists, there are NO acrobatic acts throughout the show. You could say the roller skates act was acrobatic... but c'mon... it wasn't even that good. I bet the local skate park has skaters just as talented who could do cooler tricks. \n\nIt's a lot of dancing! Lots of really cool dancing and special effects. So, if you go in with the mindset of it's a musical, you won't be as disappointed. \n\nPROTIP: go to the show when you're stoned senseless. No honestly, the acts will make a lot more sense if you're high. The whole thing is like a psychedelic dream episode anyways. You're not suppose to watch it, but FEEL it. As much as I didn't like the show, I want to see it again, stoned. I bet it's fantastic stoned. \n\nI will say their interpretation of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in my life. And their Get Back number was cool too. But for $140 for balcony seats for two... I say, pass. There's better shows in town."
1,Really impressed with my visit and Larry did a fantastic job! I got the regular manicure and pedicure but it was anything but regular...totally beyond my expectations. I can't wait to return and try the luxury pedicure and be spoiled. \n\nCompared to other nail salons...the price is totally reasonable and on the lower end. \n\nIf you are looking for a new nail salon where the people are kind and treat you with respect and will call you by your name. This is your place :)
0,"I came in for take out so I can't really comment on the service or any other menu items.  I can however comment on the sushi.  The prices are great, at the time of this review they were running a 50% off all sushi.  \""You get what you pay for\"" is certainly how I felt after my first visit, which in this case what not a whole lot.  The sushi rice was not properly cooked, mushy on the outside, crunchy on the inside.  The rolls are thin, not rolled tight and lacked any of the usual cucumber/avocado or toppings/sauces.  The tempura was definitely NOT made to order, hence not crunchy but rather stale, the California roll had nothing but imitation crab, again no cucumber etc.   I was rather excited to see this place as it is conveniently located on my way home from work. Sadly, I will not return."
1,"Pro's -  Best outlet shopping I've ever experienced.  Got both a Coach and Dooney Bag for under 100.00 each.  Tank tops at Banana Republic for 4 bucks.  Got my son some shirts for 5 bucks each and some dress clothes from Gap for under a 100 bucks for two shirts and two pants.  Husband got two Quicksilver shorts for 50 bucks.  We could have done a lot more damage but our time was limited.\n\nCon's -  It was hot!  But then it was our choice to travel to Vegas in the middle of July.  There were busloads of foreign tourist who push and shove their way around the place, especially in the Coach and Dooney store.  At the Dooney store this lady was giving the salesgirl a hard time because she couldn't use this coupon she had for an additional 10% off on a particular item."
1,"Just had chicken parmwich and buffalo chicken pizza ... Was amazing, great food and service"
1,"Generally speaking, people only go out of their way to say mean things or to complain. After reading the other reviews I feel you should hear a different type of review. \nI myself have been a resident since Feb., 2014. I like it here. The office staff is wonderful and very helpful. Any work order I have put in has been done promptly. I love the fact that they always clean up their mess too =] The property is well kept. I feel relatively safe. I am thankful they don't just let anyone move in. The price is very favorable. During the day the parking lot is empty but at night it is full. That tells me that we live in a complex where people have jobs and are looking for the same things I am. A restful and peaceful place to come home to after a tough day. In closing, I just want you to know that I would choose to live here again if I had it to do all over. Thank you Colores Del Sol employees and residents."
1,"We celebrated my friend's birthday at Bouchon.\n\nDown to what really matters, what we had..\n\nDRINKS:\nBouchon & Nirvana - both were okay. My friend wasn't too impressed with her Bouchon, but I liked my Nirvana. Tasty froth that reminds me of Orange Julius. I can't find their drink menu so I can't tell you the ingredients.\n\nFOOD:\nMACARONI AU GRATIN (6.50) - Superior macaroni. Baked just so the cheese is slightly crisp, the pasta perfect. I could've eaten that all night.\nHARICOTS VERTS (6.50) - Kids, eat your veggies. But these were overcooked, therefore, sat untouched for a while until I realised I needed to be eating greens.\nSTEAK FRITES (33.50) - Well seasoned, nicely cooked and perfectly paired with frites. And dang, those were some seriously addictive fries, but then again, I am a french fry addict.\nMOULES AU PISTOU (27.50) - Whoa. Talk about mussels. Tons and tons of them which were sweet and delicious. I love seafood drowning in white wine. And more pomme frites. God help me.\nCROQUE MADAME (18.95) - I thought it was tasty, but my friend thought it wasn't as good as other croque madames she's had. Again, more fries. Thank goodness our waiter talked us out of getting another side of them. Whew!\n\nDESSERTS:\nPROFITEROLES (9.50) - I thought the puffs were a bit hard, but they were fun to eat. I liked the ice cream a lot but I think it was more that it felt good in my mouth.\nBENEIGHTS (?) - These aren't on the menu but were a special for the night. Yummy. They reminded me of malasadas!\nPETITS FOURS SECS & FLAN (complimentary) - Because it was my friends birthday, Bouchon gave us a plate of petits fours secs and flan. We liked the petits fours a lot. Every single one had a fun texture and light taste. The flan was yummy. Not too heavy with a really smooth consistency.\n\nSERVICE: We were promptly seated as we arrived at our reservation time of 8:30pm. Our waiter (I forget his name) was attentive, knowledgeable and quick. He brought my friend and I navy blue linens instead of going with their house white, he explained the cheeses to us which we were going to have for dessert but ended up going with major sweets, and he didn't linger or not come around enough. Our water glasses were always filled, we didn't want for anything as far as service went.\n\nBouchon didn't disappoint I'm glad to say. I am looking forward to French Laundry, someday. . . ."
1,"I was excited to see an urgent care pop up closer to home than the one at 7th ave and Camelback. I hurt my neck about a month ago and with the pain increasingly impacting my daily function, I decided to drop in. This location is at 3rd ave and Thomas, south of the hospital. It is a new place and at 2:30 pm on a Monday was empty. I filled in some paperwork and was brought back quickly. The P.A. on staff thought my issue was whiplash but said they wanted to x rays to be sure. I was so happy they could do that on site and give me preliminary results that there wasn't anything serious going on. I was in and out in 35 minutes and got a few calls the next days making sure I was feeling better. I did get called at home, work, and cell phone which I thought was overkill. But overall, I was very happy with their service."
1,"All in all this is one of my favorite breakfast places.  Even when I travel I try to find one.  It just has good food.  I will admit it is an old lady place (when Mom comes to town, I always bring her to Mimis...) and avoid Sundays if you can as your wait could be an hour.  My favorites are the Crab Cake Benedict or the West Coast Reuben.  The blueberry muffins are the bomb!"
1,"Lidl is cheap. Fact. You come here for the cheap products which often don't even have English on the label. No problem with that. There are constant deals on and as expected it's quite a shabby place - the shop assistants do look on the verge of severe depression and I don't really blame them really. The lighting doesn't help, neither does the bad airing system (too many unwashed bodies in one small place). But as I emphasised the low prices are quite appealing. Mind you not everything is a bargain, some of the more famous brands you might find a few pennies cheaper elsewhere. Then there are the \""alternative\"" brands of the same thing.\n\n If you have taken upon yourself to do that evenings flats dinner then this is the place for you."
1,"Really great, high quality food.  We had breakfast and bloody mary's which are very spicy - they definitely don't use a pre-made mix.  Really enjoyed our meal and great service and will look forward to a future visit.  The service was a bit slow but with any new restaurant, it'll be that way at first, so I say - don't beat them up over it - especially if you want to support non-chain type restaurants for more unique, pleasurable dining experiences."
1,"Super nice staff! Helped us find a dinner reservation on a Friday night. Nice wine selection. Music is a tad loud, but still had a great time."
0,"Must have picked an off night because I had one of the worst steaks of my life. The bartenders were great. I see a lot of positives on here, so I'll just chalk it up to a bad night. Haven't left my room since, if you catch my drift."
0,"This place was horrible and depressing for me. I thought it would be nice like the ones I've been to back in California but was I wrong. You would not want to come here to shop for baby gears. This place is so ghetto, it's kinda freightening. Yes, they may have really cheap prices but the quality of stuff is pretty budget too. For about the same price, I prefer to go to Target instead."
0,"This past weekend, we were staying at Luxor and had made plans to meet someone at Public House; it seemed like a nice place and wasn't too busy. Unfortunately, she was sick and had to cancel, but we stayed the course and went there as planned.\n\nWhen we arrived, the hostess said she had a half booth/half table available for us, despite the fact that there were about 4-5 open booths in sight. I mentioned this, and she said that the server in that section was overwhelmed, and that she didn't want us to have a poor experience. Okay, so kudos to her for being honest; shame on management for being so poorly staffed on a Saturday afternoon in Las Vegas. Reluctantly we did the half table.\n\nWe sat there for literally 10 minutes before anyone came to the table. Finally, it was the same hostess that came and poured some water for us, saying someone would be right out.\n\nThat should have been our exit right then and there. But, we stayed.\n\nOur waitress was nice, but she called me \""sweetheart\"" as soon as she came to the table. Now, I wouldn't take notice usually IF the waitress were older than me, or I was in the South. However, she was young, and Vegas is definitely not the South; it really rubbed me weird. Other than that, she was friendly and took our orders: Steak & Eggs special, for $15 each.\n\nAfter ordering, we waited. And waited. And waited. The food took forever to come out, with the waitress showing up only once to say that the orders were almost ready. No \""Can I get you anything while you wait?\"" or anything. Meh.\n\nWe ordered our steaks medium rare. When the plates came, mine was brown all the way through and my girlfriend's was barely pink. We opted just to eat and get the hell out, because the meal was going to be comped off of our account anyway by the M Life folks. However, the food was SO bland and tasteless, we were really put off.\n\nMy girlfriend ate maybe 1/3 of her food and I about 2/3 (the hash browns and scrambled eggs were okay). At that point, we were done. Our waitress never came over to ask how everything was once. Finally, she came and without asking, simply picked up our plates.\n\nHere's the thing - if you were a server in a restaurant and one of your guests barely ate anything on her plate, wouldn't you be trained or even INCLINED to ask if there was a problem with the food? Not even a little bit? Nope; nada. She just picked up the plates and left.\n\nIn the end, I asked to speak to the manager. It was a young guy, and when he asked what was wrong, I wasn't an ass about it, but I told him I couldn't remember a worse meal in recent memory in Las Vegas. He asked what specifically was wrong, and I told him whoever was in the kitchen didn't deserve to be working there - that we could have gone to McDonald's in the food court and had tastier food. I then explained that I'd ordered my steak medium rare and it was as pink as the sole on my Doc Martin. He said he wished we'd told him sooner, and then I mentioned that would be impossible since we hadn't seen our waitress the entire time we had our food except for when she came to collect the plates. I told him his staff was not good, nor were they intuitive to guests' needs at all - or they simply are use to this and don't care anymore.\n\nThe manager was apologietic and asked us to give them another chance during our weekend, and I explained that honestly, in Vegas, where there are SO many GOOD choices of exciting restaurants that there was virtually no margin for this type of horrible service. I was frank, and told him we wouldn't be coming back. At that point, he took the check, said he'd take care of it and walked away; it was obvious that he'd dismissed us and that it was over.\n\nRegardless of whether a meal is going to be comped or not - and there is no way for a kitchen staff to know anyway - NO restaurant in Vegas should be content with this, and no management team should be okay with it. Shame on Luxor too, for not being aware that this is happening in one of their prime food locations.\n\nI'd avoid Public House at Luxor completely; you can do much, much better than to waste a Vegas meal opportunity here."
1,"What a great brewpub! I was in Madison for 10 days, and I somehow became the Duke, ha. \n\nMy favorites included the Scotch Ale (surprisingly very drinkable), Double Dubbel (comes in a bomber, MY FAVORITE over all of them), and their Kolsch. Fantastic stuff. If you're fan of lighter, wheat beers, the Hefeweizen and Crop Circle Wheat are good choices - many of my friends enjoyed those. \n\nIn general, the beers and alcoholic drinks are reasonably priced. I got a pretty tasty Long Island here as well. The food is yum, and there's loads of seating indoors and out. \n\nUntil next time, Dane."
0,"Red alert. Red Alert. \n\nIf you are looking for good mobile phone customer service, this is not the store. I'm changing my provider to Verizon or AT&T after the experience I had last night. Here's how it went down....\n\nI headed in around 6:30pm as my contract expired so I needed to upgrade my phone and sign on for two more years. When I entered, I noticed around eight employees out front and three in the back...so I thought to myself, this won't take long, there are a ton of people working. I signed in with the \""receptionist\"" who told me the wait to buy a new phone would be 10 minutes. No biggie, I told her, I'll just go check out all the gadgets. \n\nForty minutes later I was still waiting - and showing as third on the list for service. Now this wouldn't be a big deal if I wasn't watching the employees talk to each other and head into the back for long periods of time while customers were waiting out front. I literally timed two people between customers - one waited over 15 minutes before helping someone else and the second employee wasn't helping anyone when I left and it had been 20 minutes since his last customer. \n\nNeedless to say, I left the store...but not before telling them to take me off the list so the poor people in line after me didn't have to wait even longer. I will not be back and have been researching other providers today."
1,"The restaurant itself has almost a casual cafeteria vibe, but I go there every time I pass through the area. The food is quick, cheap and DELICIOUS. The portions are great as well. I have only ordered one thing, but I've tasted a lot of friends' meals. Everything is top notch. Delivery + drive through as well."
0,"Sunday evenings must be the day they schedule employees who have performance issues to work. Server was slow and seemed to be in a bad mood, chicken I ordered had strange metallic taste. Nicely asked for it to be sent back and the server said, \""well it is Moroccan\"" and while removing the plate, did not even try to hide her annoyance. Next time will go to another District restaurant,"
0,"The pluses:  We stayed in the Pyramid and the rooms were ok, as far as cleanliness and beds and view go.  The hotel was the least smoky hotel I've ever stayed in in Vegas.  It wasn't very crowded.   Minuses:  hotel check-in girl was rude.  We had to come back after not being able to find how to get to the elevator to get to our room.  We were surprised by a \""resort fee\"" which was crap.  We never got the newspaper they said we would get.  The heater in the room didn't work and it was very smoky despite being the least smoky place!  Main floor is confusing as all get out.  The tv remote didn't work correctly and the tv picture was crap and the buttons didn't work.  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE eat at the buffet.  It was the PITS.  The Paradise Cafe was better but expensive for diner food.   We were told they had wireless internet, but discovering in the room that they didn't.. called the front desk, said there was a cable to use.  We couldn't find it so they said they would send someone with a new cable.. and they never came.  This place blows and I won't stay here again."
0,"Pretty low end for a purported high end hotel. Price is good ($20) for lunch but it really seemed like a larger version of the Old Country Buffet. Nothing very surprising or interesting to choose from though the Indian station was a bit different.  Crab legs were a bit suspect, too.  I'd save my money and go to a better hotel buffet (Wynn, Paris, Bellagio)."
1,"Awesome neighborhood joint.  Great wings,  delicious pizza and super friendly service! Love that you can watch pretty much any game at any time here, there are soooo many friggin tv's!"
0,Fun atmosphere... Bad service. Didn't receive our appetizer and our orders came out incorrect. Ran out of beverages and did not get checked on once. Will not be back.
0,"The food was mediocre.  Husband ordered a combination platter specifically to get some gator.  He received his plate with no gator.  When he questioned where his gator was, he was told that they were out of gator.  Um, hello? Why wouldn't they inform him of that when he ordered it?  The manager said that they wouldn't be getting any gator until the end of the month (this was mid-month) so it's not like they suddenly ran out.  Our waitress was nice but so new that every time we asked a question, she had to leave us to go find out the answer.  Made for very slow service."
0,"We eat here from time to time. It is good enough that we go back, but not my favorite. My husband thinks it is great."

0,"Since I loved coming to Bachi so much the first time, I came back a 2nd time a week later, but they were closed for a private party.  Three days later, I made a return.  Unfortunately, the service was extremely slow, taking 35 minutes to get our food.  On top of this, the waitress did not come one time to check on us.  When we asked about getting our fries, they informed us that it was up to us to ask them to bring it out before our burgers if we wanted the fries first (even though they automatically brought us our fries first on our last visit).\n\nWe ordered the peking duck steamed buns, which were very good, but not as good as burgers.  We also ordered the sliders, to which they forgot to add the fried eggs we had wanted.  The waitress gave us a %10 discount for all these mistakes and the slowness of the service, but I left feeling very dissatisfied.\n\nI can understand the wait if the restaurant was packed, but almost 40 minutes for food when the restaurant is less than half full is incomprehensible to me, especially when the waitress doesn't even come to check on you."
0,"I have heard that this is an older well established restaurant.  This place is clearly starting to show its age.  \n\nThe service was abysmal.  Around five or six tables, two waitresses, and they still could not serve everyone.  The waitress had plenty of time to talk to friends. The waitress even had trouble with our wine and order.  We had to repeat our order several times and we were right next to the computer. \n\nWe had, at best, warm food when it go to our table.    We asked for our appetizer first and got both entree and appetizer.  The appetizer was pipping hot and the food was warm.  Just a really bad experience all around with the slow service and sub par food.  \n\nIf you had a choice between this place and staying at home, I would save the money and hassle of eating on the strip"
1,"Let me first start by saying that I, like everyone else, don't really enjoy having work done on my teeth or mouth. \n\nWith that said - I was informed by my awesome dentist (Power Ranch Dental) that I needed to have my wisdom teeth surgically removed. Oh fun! Because that is exactly how I wanted to spend the end of April! \n\nWell let me tell you - it was GREAT. The entire staff at Sonoma Oral and Facial Surgery are great - especially the doctor and the dental assistant. I felt comfortable through out the entire consultation - even when the dental assistant joked \""we haven't killed anyone... yet\"" (for anesthesia you have to watch a consent video)\n\nWhen it came to the day of the \""big pull\"" everything went as planned. My molars were pretty empacted but the surgery was a resounding success. Absolutely everything I was told would happen, or I would feel, was 100% accurate. No surprises. \n\nMy follow-up appointments have also been great. I healed well and no longer have pressure pain in my mouth. \n\nI wasn't going to write a review initially. I loved everything but since most of my reviews are positive I thought I needed to chill a bit. What made me write this review is that I got my EOB in the mail from the insurance company and noticed that I had paid about $90 more the day of service than I was supposed to. I've dealt with this in the past and every time I have been told one reason or another why the extra I paid was really supposed to be charged. \n\nMuch to my surprise, and elation, when I called I was told \""we noticed that yest yesterday when we got the paperwork from the insurance company and we have already processed your refund.\"" How cool is that? I have NEVER been that lucky. Usually I have to fight with the doctor to get my money back. (My wife is a medical biller so I know the game)\n\nSo that's it. If you need these guys you will be in EXCELLENT hands - literally!"

1,"This place is great!!  Friendly staff and quality bbq!  This is real bbq, not the stuff they throw in an oven and soaked in Liquid Smoke.  Heck, the big honking smoker is right there so you can see the food come right out of it.  In addition, the Hawg Dawg, potato skins and nachos are all absolutely amazing.  Wash it down with a PBR in a can and I am a happy girl!  \n\nAs for the Illinois BBQ comment below, they aren't from IL so not sure what he's talking about.  Also, just for clarification, BBQ started in the South but not in the Southwest!!  This is amazing BBQ and worth the drive!!"
0,"New to the area and decided to try this place based on Yelp reviews & proximity. I was not impressed at all; the food was very bland with little to no flavor. We ordered chicken lo mein, vegetable egg rolls, spicy beef, Kung pao chicken and house fried rice. The \""spicy\"" beef was actually sweet, the Kung pao chicken was completely devoid of flavor and the house fried rice was okay. The chicken lo mein and egg rolls were the least offensive dishes...\n\nI try to steer clear of chains like Panda Express but the food was so bad it made me wish I had gone there instead."
1,"They got my order started fast and the employees are happy. So am I. Life is good.  I appreciate a business where the employees are happy and friends.  They all seem to get along well, which really helped the environment. Would I say this Starbucks is better than most, yes. Would I go out of my way just to go to this Starbucks, probably not, but I would go back."
0,"All of the restaurants on the Wynn property are ridiculously overpriced.  The Buffet is no exception.  As reviewed many times here, the meats were mostly dry and flavorless, especially the sausage.  The Kobe meatloaf was horrible.  The brisket was fine, though.\n\nThe sushi rice was very cold and hard, as is stated many time here.  You'd think they'd fix that.  The seafood crepes were cold, even though they had just been put out.  The lamb meatballs were OK, but wild boar risotto was dry and not well seasoned.\n\nThe variety is great, the dishes are somewhat exotic, but they taste and preparation of the food was very very disappointing.  However, if you want to sample a variety of mediocre food and don't want to pay the crazy prices at the other Wynn restaurants, your $40+ here will get you more quantity."
0,"We were really hoping this would be a great place.  It may be, but unfortunately, they forgot our order and we sat in a mostly empty restaurant for about 45 minutes wondering what happened to our sandwiches.  Ended up leaving hungry because we couldn't stay any longer.  They did credit us back for the entire meal, so that was good.  Maybe we'll try again??"
0,"Sullen waitress Renee after asking if we were ready to order dinner for the 2nd time simply walked away without comment when my friend and I asked for just a few minutes more.  \n    When I asked if I could substitute Collard Greens in place of the included salad I was met with annoyance.  Upon receiving our meals, Shrimp and Grits and the Black Bean Quesadilla, Renee did not serve the \""infamous mile-high biscuits\"" until we had to ask for them!  The were undercooked, underwhelming and dry- served with nothing but the apple butter that was in a squeeze-bottle on the table.  \n   My dish should have been labeled \""Grits with Shrimp Garnish\"" while my friend's dry quesadilla had a garnish of a completely inappropriate sweet sauce on top, no salsa and extremely dry, tasteless, salty potato cubes, possibly straight from the Cisco frozen section.  When Renee was asked if a side of salsa was possible we were given a hot tiny container of tomato pomodoro sauce-  the farthest thing from salsa imaginable.\n    The collards were basically inedible and were seasoned with so much MSG-laden spice that I immediately had a coughing fit-  no hint of bacon or ham as one would expect from southern greens.  Renee and another server simply snickered in the back of the restaurant at this and never replenished drinks or water.  \n   We were never offered dessert but rather presented with the check and lamely told about some charity \""cherry\"" on some random desert by Renee.  I would never go back to this \""restaurant\"" due to quality of food and there-lack-of of service!"
0,"Like much in Vegas, pretty on the outside, but no substance.\n\nAte here twice on a recent business trip. The space, redecorated from its previous goofy pseudo-diner style, is quite nice, masculine and casual yet well-appointed, with a classy bar and the now-ubiquitious but still pretty old style light bulbs. Sat at the bar and had friendly and attentive service. \n\nThe breakfast was standard - eggs/toast/sausage/potatoes were like \""diner plus\"" with a flavorful pepper mixed in with the potatoes and thick texas style toast. Fine. The major disappointment was dinner. I went in craving something just barely healthy (after a few days in Vegas I was desperate for a vegetable) and the main recommended entree at Citizens is a chicken/brocolli/potato plate that looked great. Unfortunately the execution was inexcusably poor, especially for a \""signature\"" dish. The chicken was flavorless and dry, even with the skin left on. Broccoli rabe was undercooked and also flavorless, and the potato quarters were the least cooked of all, with a full half of them too hard to even cut with a fork, and inedible. Everything sat in a plate full of broth, perhaps that's in an attempt to disguize the dryness and blandless of the food, but even the broth doesn't help. Chow in San Francisco does this chicken/brussel sprouts/mashed potato dish that's just bursting with flavor and juiciness, and it's like 12 bucks. This $25 plate was just sad and pointless. Again, like so much in Vegas in general, it's an opportunity to spend twice as much on something half as good."
0,"One of the worst most expensive Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. I live in Los Angeles and am used to good Mexican food and this was a disaster. I think I could find a taco truck that serves better Mexican food. The only good factor was the martini but at $17.00 it still left a lot to be desired. I ordered a chipotle chicken that was tiny, ice cold and at $28.00 a complete rip off. I had to send the meal back and was told it would only take a couple of minutes to get my Pollo Asado. Twenty minutes later I had not gotten it and my guest had already completed their meal. When the dish finally arrived it was a plain chicken breast, a side of beans, and a Chile pepper. It looked like something you would get at Baja Fresh.  Our bill was $85.00 for two entrees and two martinis. At these prices you would expect something unique. I have had better food at Chipotles and spent$ 10.00."
0,"we went to STFK for the first and unfortunately the last time tonight. I'm not sure if they hired an outside company to come up with this concept or they thought of it internally, but they can save a ton of money by NOT remodeling the remaining stores, and will stop losing long time customers like us.  I always finished up with their chili, but now it's an additional $3.49, and no more hot chocolate chip cookies. BTW, no more coupons either, so it's time to look for another place to have a healthy meal..."
0,"I haven't eaten at the restaurant, but I did witnessed the manager of this establishment come into the Subway on Penn and 6th and yell at the subway manager for using Taste of Dahntahn's garbage cans.

0,"First night- check into a stay well grand queen suite. Those nasty little escort cards were taped to the window, toilet was broken (never fixed), & we requested extra towels which we never received.\nSecond night, upgraded to the 2 bedroom Skyline Marquee Suite for that night and the next. No hot water in one of the restrooms. Call and talk to the front desk 4-5 times over the next couple of hours and they kept saying \""it was in the process of being fixed\"". Nobody ever showed up. So we paid over $1k for a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom suite and only got a 2 bed 1&1/2 bath. Also, my friend that was staying with me had someone spill red wine on his suit, he called and talked to them and they said they would come take his suit and get it cleaned for him. Good thing we didn't hold our breath because...  Surprise, they never showed up.\nThe lack of customer service was astounding."
0,"If I could, I would give this place a zero because that's what I got from this place; nothing. Here's why.\n\nI don't plan what I'm going to eat so when Japanese come into my mind, I think about the few places in town I can go to.\n\nRecently, my party came inside some time after lunch on a workday and we were told the place is closing and schedule to be re-open later. I was like What? , on a work  hour?\n\nOn another prior visit last year, I step in and ordered 2 dishes to-go on a worknight but later another waiter girl came back to me saying \""because we are so full of (other) customers, we won't take to-go order\"". That was the whole point of my to-go order because there lines waiting outside. Totally illogical, they could have said it would be a 30 minute wait and I would be fine with that. They didn't even try at recourse or more politically correct; they were not properly trained.  I think they've added outdoor seats to mitigate this.\n\nI felt priveledge to have patron them a few times, and my review of  the food is typical Japanese; clean and fresh. But, You can get that down the street  on Bell Rd too.\n\n\nNever have I felt similar to being discriminated and these waiters are northern Asian!  At least if  I got something from them even bad food, it was a purchase the merchant supposively should be happy to pocket and there's a chance I come back."
1,"Last stop on our Buffet of all Buffets line. Came here for brunch before we left for home. This buffet is HUGE!! I thought there was only a certain amount of selection so when I asked my friend where he got something and he pointed to the other side, I was shocked that it was that big! \n\nThere was plenty of breakfast/lunch food. Bottomless mimosas and our waiter NEVER stopped re-filling them. As soon as he saw saw an empty cup, it would definitely be filled. \n\nFor the most part, the food was really good. As this was my 3rd buffet this weekend, I didn't really feel like eating too much, but what I ate wasn't too bad. And they have a soup bar! I love soup! Their dessert slection was cut though. I think it was because it wasn't dinner yet :/\n\nOverall, I think it was really good. I think the huge selection just really impressed me!"
0,"Harsh. This is the best word we could come up with to describe Hash House. Just call it Harsh House.\n\nWe wandered here while waiting for our car to be serviced at AutoNation. 11am on a Saturday there was a line out the door. It smelled promising. We were seated in less than 10 and our waiter appeared in under a minute. Coffee and waters were back in less than 2 minutes. They place was packed so the service really is excellent. The food, eh. \n\nThe music is loud, and harsh and abrasive. The d\u00e9cor is harsh; I get they're going for a certain look, but it's not very comfortable. The food is, well, harsh. The spices just a tad more than the tastebuds are comfortable with. It was weird. I wanted to say I liked my giant heaping portions of salmon eggs benedict with weird plastic cheese sauce, but I couldn't. They were too... harsh. \n\nIf I were a tourist completely hungover from a night of debauchery on the strip and my tastebuds were fried from cigarettes I might like this place. But we won't ever eat here again."
1,"The atmosphere is very relaxing, beautiful artwork and a lovely mountain view beyond the parking lot along with the soothing Thai music makes this a wonderful place to relax and enjoy your food.\n\nI tried the ginger peach tea and Pho Thai dish. The tea is nice and cold, it seems to work well with my dish.  The Pho Thai has beef and rice noodles in a soup form that reminds me vaguely of ramen. It's gluten free since the noodles are a rice noodle, there are scallions and onions in it and it comes with a side dish that contains bean sprouts, a few jalape\u00f1o slices, some herbs and a spicy sauce dish that you can choose from to add to your soup.  It was delicious and a huge bowl so I ended up taking more than half of it home. \n\nThis was on the lunch menu so it was $8 for the soup, a great deal for the amount of food! I'm definitely coming back and bringing friends."
0,"I stayed in the main tower. Last time I stayed in the Palms Tower, which I liked very much. My room was dated and showed some wear. The shower head didn't work well and hot water took very long to heat up. The fitness center was a joke! A few exercise machines put into an unused room in the other tower was all that was provided without a charge. The TV there didn't work and the AC ran warm. Forget about this if you go. I was unable to print my boarding pass in the \""business center\""  and got no help from the agents at the Front Desk. I was charged for Internet access in the \""free zone\"" public areas after being told that I wouldn't be charged. All during my stay, I felt like your guest services staff were not happy or pleased to do so. The only bright spots for me were Charles in the Ceres Restaurant, Cliff and Rick at the Palms Port Cochere, and Ron at the Spa. They met and exceeded my expectations with pleasure."
1,"OMG OMG OMG, the happy hour hamburger is so delicious (I think it's the bacon that does it). \n\nI've only been here twice, and both times for happy hour. They have an excellent happy hour for the quality of food they serve. I've tried, obviously the burger and also the crab cakes, both which were yummy. The drink specials are great too, they make a great margarita and have an ample wine list. I'll be back!"
1,"I'm back In Vancouver now and find myself missing this gym, it had everything I needed and waaay more.  It's huge (and clean), with tons of equipment, has a shake and food bar, a shop with protein supplements and vitamins, but most importantly has an amazing room for boxing and kickboxing training.  \n\nOver the course of a few sessions I worked with a trainer named Matthew.  Though I'd been training in kickboxing for about 6 months I'd picked up some bad habits.  Matthew brought it back to basics for me and pushed me until I had given up nearly every shred of energy I had.  He's got a great demeanour without being forceful, making me want to work harder and harder, and he's got a great eye for body alignment, showing me subtle ways to get more out of my movements.  \n\nNext time I'm back in Montreal, however brief, I'll be sure to book a training session with him again."
0,"As other reviewers have described, the customer service here is quite lacking. When I called in to make a reservation for a Tuxedo rental for my fianc\u00e9, they placed me on hold for almost fifteen minutes. I eventually just hung up and called them back... to be placed on hold again, this time for only five minutes. Creating the reservation also took quite some time, even though I already had all of my fiance's measurements and the style numbers of the tuxedo we wanted.\n\nIf we weren't receiving a group discount here for the event we reserved for, I probably would have just gone to Mr. Formal. They are a local shop just down the street on Camelback with excellent prices, customer service and selection. A huge bonus there is that they ARE the warehouse, so they have everything in stock and there are never any rush charges."
1,"Ate there Saturday Sept 27th staying across the street in spring hill suites we wanted something to eat and the buffalo pierogies were awesome , wife had pull pork sandwich which she liked and I had sloppy joe sandwich and was very good.

0,"Me and a bud when out to eat, he is single and wanted to go to this place.  we asked if we could sit nearest the TV with the hockey game on... ignored, After seated far and behind the hockey game screen, we waited for thirty minutes before we had to ask if we had a waiter/ waitress? after another five minutes we left, nothing was said on the way out.  Menu seemed fun, nothing really Irish, but seemed good for not hungry and testosterone filled men."
1,"Take out order usually suffer a little for oblivious reasons, but this take out was a really good one.  I do have to say the market grille cafe did well this time.\n  Called in and ordered the \n    Lentil soup\n    Pomegranate chicken spinach salad\n    Greek trio platter \n    Baklava\nWhen I arrived the order was ready.  The girl behind the counter was friendly and very thorough on making sure my Order was correct.  I mean every single item was checked. I appreciate that considering once you leave coming back is a real pain for take out.\n   Food?  Well it was delicious!  Lentil soup was pretty good.  The trio was awesome.  Salad was nice , humus and pita was good even though I'm not a big fan of that food.  The moussaka was soo good,  the other two I got mixed up. The one with the pasta noodles was also very nice.  The other with spinach was a little over powering.  \n   My fianc\u00e9 had the pomegranate chk salad.  She liked it a lot.  To much spinach for me though.  \n   One thing for sure was the baklava was very good!   So savory. I mean I enjoyed every bit.  So, after this I would say I'm going back for seconds"
0,"This place has wonderful beer, I have to give them that... but that's about it.  The food and ambiance are average; the service is very poor.\n\nA large group of my colleagues and I visited last night, and were immediately struck by the attitude of a particular waitress who seemed intent on starting a brawl of sorts with my friend.  (Our group was so upset at the behavior of this individual that a follow-up email was sent to the manager, who was not particularly responsive.)  Moreover, the food took a really long time to arrive and, when it did, it was in a piecemeal and random fashion.\n\nI will credit them for comping several of our beers after the Waitress Incident... another waitress took over and was reasonably pleasant... this prevented us from leaving, which was my initial plan.\n\nSo, to summarize:  CVB pumpkin ale with sugar-and-cinnamon rim=amazing.  Food=palatable.  Atmosphere=very loud.  Service=abysmal."
0,"I don't know about this place.  I wanted it to be good but it's not quite there for me yet.  I had fish that was stuffed with seasoned potatoes.  The fish was undercooked but the seasoned potatoes were good.  It was served with sone Libyan Rice which was seasoned with clove, cinnamon and other spices and was pretty good.  The guy behind the counter was very friendly and helpful since this was my first experience with Libyan cuisine. They're a new business so I'm willing to give them a second chance.  :)"
0,"It's okay.  I tried it in Vegas with my sorority friends because the place literally just opened an hour ago...\n\nThe menu is very limited and the prices are ~$10 for everything.  I ordered the grilled cheese... it took much longer than it should in my opinion.  My friends got all their food before me, and I ordered first.... does that make sense?  Grilled cheese for $10 is not worth it.. even if there is lobster in it.  It didn't satisfy me and the combination of fishy + cheesey did not work here.  I tried a little of my friend's lobster mac and cheese... it did not work in any favor.\n\nIt was an interesting concept, but I'd rather walk a little further to Earl's."
0,"After realizing that every other restaurant at the TI was a walk-up, take-out, [late lunch time] we opted to sit down at the buffet restaurant. \nBoring and mediocre, if I hadn't been starving I might have been offended."
0,"Ouch, this place has gone downhill like the rest of The Venetian. Came here years ago and this place was NICE! Now it feels neglected. \n\n1) They use to have bottled water. Now it's a dirty drinking fountain with a clogged filter. Water comes out at a very very slow trickle. Makes you wonder if they ever changed the filter.\n2) AC turned way too low. I was sweating to death in the joint\n3) Bathroom was not property maintained\n\nThis place is ruining the Canyon Ranch name."
0,Food is not authentic Mexican one bit. It's edible but so is Taco Bell. Not worth the money.
1,"Amazing show!!!!! I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. Worth skipping the big names of O or Zoomanity for this hilarious, more intimate acrobatic display!! The beer garden is a lot of fun too!!"

1,"We wanted to go to the pasta shop, but when we got there we found it closed -maybe for good. Based on reviews from other Yelpers we decided to try this. Much different ambiance than the pasta shop bur there was a nice waiter who looked like a cross between John waters and Johnny Depp. They had several specials as well as an extensive menus and the waiter said they could make things like fettucine Alfredo. My husband opted for that and I had lobster ravioli. The meals came with salad or soup although you had to pay extra to upgrade to Caesar salad. The salads were great and quite big. The meals were also delicious although the salad plus the entree was too much food. Our total bill was $60 which seemed like a fair price.  If your are looking for some place to eat off the strip and the pasta shop is still closed try Sergios."
1,"This is a great alternative to California Pizza Kitchen, the pizzas and salads are very good, they have great variety and great prizes, and the atmosphere is much better. I will  definitely become a regular."
1,"Now that I've been here 3 times, I feel like a review is in order! Service has been hit or miss, but I'll let it slide until there are serious issues. Atmosphere is fun for groups or a date (although I'd warn it's a little loud - not the best place for conversation).\n\nDrinks: Freaking awesome. I've enjoyed most of the mojitos I've tried (particularly like the pineapple coconut \""paradise\"" flavored one), and I also really enjoy the sangria. I'm disappointed their HH ends at 6 PM, however. \n\nFood: I love the mix of spanish and new american tapas they have. The duck rolls, sliders, and mac and cheese are all favorites of mine although I realize they aren't spanish at all! I do think they do a better job of \""plating\"" the tapas here than Babreeba - for instance the beer battered shrimp come with a huge plate of assorted fried veggies. \n\nOverall a fun off the strip place to go. We went there with a group of 12 last night and got buzzed and full for $40 each with tax and tip. Not bad for Vegas."
1,Pretty good food and fun atmosphere. \n\nYo Yo

0,"I come here quite often and invariably they mess up my order. \nToday's screw up was I ordered 2 sandwiches without cheese and 3 sandwiches no lettuce. \nWhat I got was 5 sandwiches no cheese and all of them had lettuce. \nThis is getting ridiculous. . The receipt was correct. . Exactly as I ordered it.. so that means the person who made the food cannot read at all.\nFrom now on no matter how many people are waiting behind me, I will check my order and make them fix it before they can help the next person. ."
0,"I must say I've always LOVED Maurices, been shopping there since I was 12-13 years old! Clothes are reasonably priced and will last MANY washes and wears!! Even worked for the company for a short time.\n\nI still go in to this store to buy necessary 'staple' items because they fit so well and are great on the budget. However, the service I receive at this store is not only snotty and short but it's not the same service delivered to everyone. I've witnessed on more than one occasion these girls be hateful behind customers back... you never know when someone will hear you. And they are blatantly bit**y to me. If I based my shopping in this store strictly on SERVICE I would NEVER go back. Lucky for them, the price is right! \nIt's funny that a company founded off a small town feel and friendliness allows a store manager and her assistants to behave in a manner far from... The leader creates the culture of the environment, so its no surprise to me that each of the associates behaves this way!"
1,"Fresh cup is a refreshing new boba place right in central Las Vegas! I stepped in and already loved the atmosphere. The place was clean, cute, and I was immediately greeted by the friendly staff! \n\nI got the Thai Tea blended with egg pudding and boba. Their boba was cooked PERFECTLY! It was up to par with Half and Half, which I frequently visit in SoCal! The drink was overall a refreshing way to cool down from the hot Vegas heat!"
0,"This company is a total joke.  I try to run a law office using their printer.  The printer is a constant problem, and their support is not afraid to be rude to you because their stuff doesn't work.  Not impressed with this company and will be dropping them when the contract is up no question about it."
0,"I've been getting my nails done for years, always at the same place though. I was in the area and needed a new set desperately so came here, it looked like a nice place. WRONG!\n\n I got pink and white nails which is what I always get (for $35) which is apparently their \""solar nails\"" that cost me $45. Whatever, I paid and tipped without complaining. The next day I could clearly see where over half of my nails had lifted and were coming loose. You could also see the line where the tip was glued on and not covered by the white gel.\n\nI didn't have the time to go back to the salon to show them my nails at the time and figured I could make them last for 2-3 weeks and just go to my regular salon to get a fill in. WRONG AGAIN! By Wednesday, 2 nails had popped off and they all looked horrible. Remember, thats only 4 days after they put the new set on. \n\nGot off work Wednesday and went to the salon to get a new set put on or my money back. They argued with me and told me their policy stated they would only replace within the first 3 days of getting your nails done. Needless to say I had to raise hell to get all of my nails fixed. And, they still looked horrible. Will never recommend this place to anyone nor will I ever go to a nail salon without reading the reviews first."
1,"I am a pizza lover.  I actively search out the best pizza.  When I go on vacation, I make sure to visit at least a few of the top rated pizza places in the state I am in.  But Grimaldi's still beats them all out.  Even though I am a pizza enthusiast I am not one who can analyze every ingredient, so I won't be describing the pizza taste in detail here, I just know if it tastes good or not.  I just got back from a trip to Seattle, and visited two places that claimed to be certified from Italy for their pizza, and I would still take Grimaldi's over them.  I think Bianca is way over hyped, and I'm not one who is eager to wait over two hours for my dinner.  Salads are great, pizza is great GO HERE!!!  Only thing I would complain about is that all pizzas are make your own, and adding a couple toppings can run up the bill.  But even just getting pepperoni is amazing."
1,"Been here a few times with frat boys but I never catch a good night. I mean hey, I obviously make the best of it and enjoy myself but it's never quite as packed as I'd hope it to be. Usually I find myself looking around and knowing everyone in the room which isn't what you're always looking for on a night out. \n\nIt's a pleasure getting into Jackrabbit when you're with the right people and the bouncers have always treated me well. \n\nI remember going there last year after the Lupe Fiasco concert on a Thursday for my birthday and the bartender gave me a free drink.. or two ;)\n\nThe music's great and I've even been on stage shaking my booty here and there. \n\nThough I doubt you'll be checking out the decor of the place next time your there, do check the wall paper its cheesy but cool!"
0,"Strip Burger is the indoor/outdoor burger joint attached to the Fashion Show mall on the Strip side. Since we had a $100 gift certificate and the prices are reasonable, we had the freedom to over order and had a fair sampling of their offerings.\n\nWe started with three milkshakes, which obviously were a hit with the kids. The chocolate and strawberry were both good, but nobody really cared for the vanilla. It isn't too hard to blend ice cream with milk so no points were scored for this indulgent first course. My brother and I each had beer to go with our milkshake (bad timing) and my sister-in-law had a margarita that was shaken in one mason jar and served in another. The presentation was cute but because the drink tasted worse than a manufactured drink from a machine at Fat Tuesday's, all points were lost.\n\nDisappointingly, the burgers weren't that great either. We had their self-proclaimed famous blue cheese burger ($9.95) and the hickory burger ($9.95). The meat itself was alright, but they hadn't considered using a necessary moisture barrier between the meat and the bun. A juicy burger cooked on a flat top is bound to drip, so the best method for preventing this is to first set the patty on a paper towel after cooking to absorb the excess liquid, and then use some other ingredient (or ingredients) to form a layer between the meat and the bun so as to prevent the bun from getting soggy, such as lettuce, onions, etc. Despite the misleading picture on their website, the bottom half of the bun turned into a thin mush. The flavor of the meat and toppings were alright, but not good enough to compensate for the burger's shortcomings, so overall they weren't terribly successful.\n\nWe also ordered the \""atomic fries\"" ($4.75) which weren't atomic at all, though it is still hard not to make fried potatoes tasty with the addition of processed nacho cheese and green chiles. I wouldn't order them again, but shamefully we still consumed most of what was in the basket. The highlight of the meal was another side, fried pickles ($3.95). I had my hesitations but I am always intrigued by interesting fried things so we tried them out. The were crunchy, vinegary, and salty, and were served with a ranch dipping sauce. I could have had these and the chocolate shake and been very pleased with my lunch.\n\nDespite the mediocrity of the meal, the prices were still quite reasonable for a casual Strip lunch and I can see why the place is usually busy. Gourmands on a food tour of Vegas certainly wouldn't eat here, but if you have friends in town on a budget that don't want to venture off the Strip, this is certainly a place a recommend. It's hard to find a sit down restaurant with such a prime location elsewhere that would cost you anything less than twice as much."
1,"If you ever want to look at accessories (mostly purses) that no one else would have. Go here. \n\nEven though the bags cost a fair deal, doesn't mean that you can't own other little accessories. They have headbands, bracelets, earrings, etc that are all so pretty! \n\nMy favourite part is their colourful range of change purses. They always spread them out in a way where it looks like a rainbow of delight!\n\nI suggest just walking in to see one of Edinburghs great independent accessory shops!"
0,"Decided to do a late-night run to Taco Bell, the line was long but we thought 'what the heck'. When we got up to the speaker box, the cashier was laughing about a joke his coworker had just told him or something. He asks us to hold on, comes back to us to take our order 5 minutes later, we order two double decker taco's (add nacho cheese plus $1), a tropical freeeze, and last minute..the 4 piece Cinnabon treats. After scrolling through my Facebook newsfeed 17 times we get up to the window. We see a lady at the counter, I assumed her shift was ending because she had her purse on the counter where they take customer's orders and she was holding a banana...between her armpit. The guy came to take our money and hands us our food. We drive away, ready to feast! We get back to our place, I unwrap the cheesy goodne-oh what the hell! NO NACHO CHEESE....okkk....we eat them anyway. I pop one of the Cinabons into my mouth, bite down on the swee-oh god! Tasted like i was biting into a handful of sand. I take another bite-not sure why, but curious to give them a second chance. NOPE. Nope. nope. Now I've been sick for a few days *sniffle* so my tastebuds have been acting up. Food is tasteless for most bites, color has become colorless, and touch..well touching is cool. ANYway, this BITE felt like cum. I'm pretty sure it was."
0,"I lived here for almost 3 years. Almost because I am pursuing legal action to get out. The staff moving in was horrendous. The staff now is so green one cannot even reason with them. The staff care not about the tenants but about profits. Strange fees pop up, security has lacked, repairs are done by the lowest bidder. For the money you'll spend here one can get so much more. Run, don't walk, from this complex."
1,"This was only my first time here, but I'm a fan already.  I think I need to make Donut Mondays a tradition so it sucks less to drive into Crafton for work.\n\nI got an Elvis donut: bacon-maple frosting on top of a banana-cream-filled donut.  It was heavenly, though a little sweet.  I'd like to have some actual pieces of bacon sprinkled on top to add a little saltiness or some dark chocolate to cut the sweetness.  The dough itself was light and the perfect combo of crunchy/crisp exterior with a light, heavenly inside.  I wonder if that's how the Crafton Angel donut got her name.  I didn't actually look at the menu boards to see the full offering, but there were also Danish pastries and muffins in the case.  The price is also reasonable ($8/dozen?!) though they're well worth more than that.\n\nThe woman behind the counter was so friendly and there was a gentleman sitting at the counter (yep, a counter, like a true diner) who was a regular customer.  Both were pleasant and I would have stayed to chat longer and actually look at the menu, but my work schedule would not allow the chit-chat.  Maybe next time I can get here earlier - they're open 10pm to 3 pm the next day (usually 24 hours, but the weather got in the way of that).\n\nAlso - is it doughnut or donut?  I insist on the latter."
0,Went in and was sized for a bra. I was told that I was wearing the wrong size and suggested a different size.  They did not carry the different size so the fitter/salesgirl suggested I make the compromise to buy the same wrong size I had previously come in wearing.  Silly.
1,"I've used them multiple times.  They are always prompt, professional, get the job done quickly and correctly, and are very fair in pricing.  Additionally, they always take the time to explain things and provide tips."
0,"Do not go here. The Aria hotel is beautiful site and a must spot to visit, but the buffet is the worst I have had  in Las Vegas (I am a local). I went with a small group and ran into friends. The buffet would not let us sit next to each other, or even the same section unless we paid an additional 18% which would have been $60 dollars - just to sit at a table next to our friends (several were open).  The service was really poor from the check-in to the server (who only showed up once the whole time).  To top it off the food was poor even by buffet standard, especially the sushi. Tried to have an open mind but even the prime rib was overcooked and thin, the salad had been siting so long it was soggy. So many better options- do yourself a favor and don't go back..   They are the first restaurant I have ever thought was so bad I would give a negative review."
0,"Horrible customer service and staff is rude. I stood by the pistol display case patiently while i waited for someone to help me with a pistol i wanted. NO ONE acknowledged. I purchased my lane ticket and figured i would ask about the pistol i wanted after. The two individuals i spoke to while purchasing my lane ticket acknowledged my soda pop. Said nothing about it. When i finished shooting an older gentleman said, \""Next time read our policy, no food or drink.\"" I don't go to shooting ranges to be disrespected. Instead of asking how my shooting went, how my firearms performed, the SW staff member was rude. \n\nSGC is the same distance to me and i get fantastic customer service. Plus, they give an awesome LEO discount. If SW doesn't want my money fine, but don't be rude to your customers. Will not be returning and will not be recommending."
0,"When dining at the Bellagio, I'm aiming for a 4 or 5 star experience.  This was way below expectations! The service was extremely spotty.  \nWe had a large party, and I do understand if certain mistakes are made during busy hours.  However, they weren't super crowded.  Took a while for everything to come out.  What I really disliked the most was the waiter dropping off everything at certain spots of the table.  If you're a fancy sushi restaurant, wouldn't you at least know or remember who ordered which food and where it went? Also, there was clearly timing issues, and dishes came out one or two at a time.  For a large party, some people had to watch others eat.  It just amazed me how they dropped off the food, and since we were a large party, it took a while to determine who had ordered it.... And the waiter was pretty clueless also! The food itself was pricy, yet it was decent. The edamame was good, as it was well seasoned.  Besides that, definitely not worth it.  I would only go here again if I was forced to... If not, definitely visit other sushi places on the strip!!"
1,"Super delicious short rib tacos!  Lots of chandeliers and candles give a dim, romantic vibe."
0,"Not very impressed. It was a half hour to closing time, so maybe they just slapped mine together or something, but I got these duck rolls and they were just.....kinda fatty/greasy and they had a strange smell to them. Then I also got pad thai with salmon and the salmon was overcooked and hard....ugh no good. The pad thai, itself, was pretty good, but not $13.95 good. I spent $30 just on myself there and it TOTALLY wasn't worth it. Save yo money!"
0,"*** IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARTS I WOULD***\n\nDO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD/EASY MADE MONEY HERE!!!! \n\nI stopped here on Thursday of last week for the first time. I was looking around for some photography props and had found an ok chair. The price was double if not triple what it should me. I mean it's a chair made out of pallets and they are charging $60 for it. Ridiculous. So I went inside and kindly asked if they negotiated prices and she said NO they are set. I said ok and thought no biggie. Because it was so dead I had asked her in a kind voice if it gets busy for her on the weekends and she said in the snottiest voice \""I don't know, I don't work the weekends\"". She never stopped to speak with me or look me in the eye. So flipping rude. \n\nThe day this place closes is the day I am throwing a party. I am so for supporting  local business and this lady and place makes it hard to sell this to others. She/they ruin it for other business owners. \n\nList to the people coming to your store and make a change or say bye bye to your store."
0,"this place only gets one star, and that's for ambiance and atmosphere.  definitely a cool place to hang, but the food is not so good.  i've honestly had better food on an airplane.  i don't write reviews, but felt compelled to write a review after our experience there.  the bread came out and it was very good, but that's where it ended.  my stuffed chicken was tough and flavorless, the crabcake was barely acceptable, and the spring rolls were bad.  to summarize it all, the food TASTED LIKE IT WAS FROM A MICROWAVE.  go for drinks, but as good as the food looks, you're better off going to Denny's."
0,Horrible! This place didn't even deserve a star! I order 1 sandwich and it took 20min to make and this was at 4:26pm they where not busy. When I got the sandwich (number 11) it only had TWO Slices of meat and a tons of carrots. This place has gone to the dumps the only thing health about this place is your jaw gets a workout from chewing the hard French bread! I'd rather go to subway and I hate subway. I'll never go here again.\n\n***Look at every French roll sandwich picture and you can see the amount of meat if you can see the meat at all!***
1,"I have been here about a handful of times, the last time at a company Christmas dinner with my husband.  They were very generous with the appetizers for about 12 people and the service was excellent.\n\nMaybe it was the holiday spirit, but the mood just seemed great for a chill and relaxed evening with my hubby's coworkers.  No one even ordered alcohol, which was probably good because we would have been there all night.\n\nThe few other times I have been to Switch was with alcohol and their mixed drinks are really good.  There was a pomegranate and vodka drink that I recall being very original and tasty.  I think one of  their happy hours it's two for one, so ended up having at least two of the same thing.\n\nAnd any place that can serve lobster mac and cheese for about 10 bucks is always worth going to."
0,"This place opened 1/21/14 been watching them construct the place, was excited to go there.........it SUCKS!!!! Fox10 news lied big when the had these people on to promote, they should be a shamed of them selves to tell people to go there  when they tasted the horrible food. All my dishes (which is a la cart) tasted like fish, inside smelled like fish. So I sat outside. I has a chicken taco, pork taco, both had no flavor and they give it to you in 1 tortilla.....hello street tacos come double stacked, had the Columbian rice, is was crunchy jasmine rice with lemon squeezed on top, the salsa was bad also had no flavor either. Nothing had flavor. My friend had the fish taco and said it was nasty. They give you a 40.oz empty bottle of beer filled with water (tap I'm sure). And the service sucked, waiter asked if we wanted our checks and forgot. The lunch crowd was gone. I had to get up and going inside and tell the guy \""did you forget us\"". I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!! Lucky I gave them 1 star, guess I had 2 eat it, pissed I did and paid for it."
0,My experience was horrible.  I was one of the first clients to arrive in the morning.  I was immediately seated in a chair for my pedicure.  The water was cold and was not asked if I was okay with that.  The nail tech was rude and rushed the pedicure to move on to one of her regular clients.  No base coat or top coat was applied to my nails.  I had to request more than one coat of nail polish and ask for a top coat.  The Bottom of my feet were scrubbed for about 30 seconds and toes were not filed evenly.  What a waste of money!!!!
0,"Only been once... won't be back.  I really really really wanted some fish tacos and they are fairly close so we tried it out.  We eat out with our baby a lot (she is under one) so we go at odd hours (to annoy less people), so keep that in mind (they probably didn't have their A game on).  \n\nDrinks were meh and the tacos were AWFUL.  I feel like I would have been better off going to taco bell (they don't have fish tacos but I would have felt more satisfied by eating their bad Mexican food than I did by eating Tex Tubb's fish tacos).  I consulted with the waiter about my fish tacos (you have four options) and decided to try the Achiote Tilapia, Fried Catfish and Marinated Shrimp.  Shrimp was overcooked, the Tilapia was ... well, the Achiote seasoning is all burn and no flavor, but it's not even that hot! (and it's on almost everything on the menu, which is why I'm not excited to give them another try)  The Catfish was the best but that isn't saying much. \n\nService was pretty good though!"
0,This was my first time here and I have to say I was unimpressed. That is just my opinion. I am sure most will call me crazy and it is not that I didn't like the sandwich I just thought it was ok. I have had better.\n\nNow to clarify I am not a fan of the major sub chain. I don't go their Way at all. I am the Duke at my favorite sub shop. Now some people may not like that place and that is fine. That's what makes the world go around. If we all had the exact same opinion on everything life would be boring. But so far everyone I have taken there likes it. Even one person who had been to Jersey Mike's before liked it more.\n\nI got the Original Italian on white bread regular size. I thought the bread was dry. The whole sandwich was dry to me but I like extra condiments on my sandwich. The meat was good and I like the fact that they slice it right in front of you but overall I was just not impressed.\n\nI will not be disappointed if I never go back to Jersey Mike's again. Not because I hated it just because in my opinion there are must better places out there. I was even excited to try it because a lot of people talk about it. Maybe I just went on a bad day. But I tried it was not impressed enough to even give it maybe one more shot. I will stick with my favorite sub place. Maybe sometime in the future someone can talk me into trying Jersey Mike's again.
0,"Okay, so to update my previous review:  Unless you plan on solely using the gym as a place to do cardio exercises and use weight machines, avoid this gym like the plague.  They wouldn't let me use my foam roller or resistance bands here because of their 'no outside equipment' policy.  Also, they don't provide things like stability balls or medicine balls, which are pretty much standard gym fare.\n\nAlso, the siren alarm makes a terrible and distracting sound whenever someone drops weights or otherwise displeases the staff.  It is so loud/unexpected that I have hurt myself both of the times it went off in my presence -- once I clocked myself in the head with a dumbbell, and once I got startled by it in the shower, and fell on my ass.  Furthermore, for a place with a 'no-judgement' policy, this gym seems to have a high tolerance for people laughing at people whose workout routines involve compound exercises.  Yes, some of these movements are strange-looking.  No, that doesn't mean it's OK to openly laugh at other gym-goers.\n\nI quit this gym yesterday and will NOT be coming back."
1,"Thank goodness for Yelp so I knew what to order here.  I smartly went with the ribs dinner with sides of mac n cheese and yams.  Everything was about as good as it could get.  \n\nPlease don't judge this place by its appearance or location.  You'll know you're there when you see the big drums where they are cooking up the ribs and chicken.  However, you may smell that distinctive smoke flavor in the air well before you make visual contact.  When you go inside it's a simple lunch counter with a few tables.  Inside it is very hot and smells like the inside of one of those drums.  Everyone was friendly and patient with me as a first-timer.  \n\nI admit, I had a Google Offer that was about to expire or I might never have heard of this place.  My certificate was good for $12 and my meal was around $10.  I wasn't worried about the difference but the young man behind the counter told me to grab a drink so I'd get my money's worth.  I went with a can of Hawaiian Punch.  Great customer service along side some legit BBQ.  Can't beat it."
0,"Casino Only: First attempt, we waited forever to get to the valet then told that valet was full. They were so disorganized so we turned around and left. The next day we tried again. I had heard that they remodeled but as far as the gaming area went, it looked like they just replaced the carpet. MGM is big, too big I think because they seem thinly staffed, not a lot of drink girls and painfully slow valet. I understand there were some big conventions going on but the other hotels didn't seem to have a problem managing the crowds. The casino floor is also the most annoying the way that it's shaped, forget about trying to find people in there."
1,"Damn It I got beat! Arrrghh yea so this was the Original of the copied Pinkberry. When one of my employees told me about it next to Joe's Pizza....I freaked because now I don't have to go to LA for this fantastic Korean staple of yummy dessert goodness. She also said they were a little bourgeois(prounounced bouzje wa) OK so they boast that they use real Yogurt and Pinkberry uses powder. Hmmm....Whatever it's good. The decor is like stepping into gramma's house but it got hit by a ball Harajuku Girls. It's got the whole minimalist yet plastic furnature outside. Modern, chic, and some over the top. Employees were newbies. So don't expect too much right away. Two flavors...GREEN TEA, and Regular....not really vanilla because of the hint of tarts. You have crazy toppings like Captain Crunch, fruity pebbles, cocoa pebbles, granola, mango, blueberry, banana, strawberry, etc...I guess the owner or manager overheard me because I'm loud. But I was looking for mochi too. He said that they would be getting them made soon! I also found out they're open till 3am? or was it 4am? Whatever....it's open late. That means late night cravings...GONE! WOO HOO!"
1,"My husband & I came here for dinner on a Saturday evening. We were seated at a booth as soon as we walked in. We ordered drinks. Then I had their specialty, the grilled cheese burger. It was unlike anything I've ever had before. There was no bun, it was buttered bread made just like grilled cheese, except there was a burger inside. Quite yummy & I would definitely recommend it. My husband had a bacon cheese burger the he liked. Said it was not great. The fries were really good. It was quite, quite loud due to a party in the bar area. But, it was a Saturday night & the place was good, so we could expect a lot of people. There & try it! The service was good too!"
0,"DO NOT GO HERE-esp. If your own posh hotel has 5 pools and better service.  Staff hung over from the precious shift at the club closing at 4am so running late to open waiting 15 minutes for kiddie pool \""beach\"" to open. Staff hounding us about buying drinks and renting beach chairs that were 1) all reserved and 2) no one was there at 10:15am.  Coming from the Bellagio I expected better service as I felt practically kicked out of there because what, we were not hot enough?!!!!  Making my blood boil just writing this esp. After spending $10 on taxi and $32 on drinks and we stayed less than 10 minutes.  All the waitresses are hot so any photos you see advertised are of them to make you think only beautiful people go there. Consoled myself with a clutch from Alexander McQueen-you won't be getting my business anymore TAO (restaurant was good, club was good but crowded).  I hope the Venetian shuts you down b/c seriously they have better and bigger pools than you."
0,"The Good:  The Gyro Meat. Can't really knock this part. They have it down. Too bad they dont do their Shwarma on a spit as well.\n\n\n\nThe Bad: Pretty much everything else. The Shwarma was very dry, the Hummus was average at best, the \""greek salad\"" was a bunch of cuccumbers and onlions diced up together. \n\nWe asked for some spicy sauce like Sriracha or something to kick up some flavors on the shwarma and they said no but they do have some pepper paste they would sell us for $1.\n\nToo many better places with much better flavor profiles in the area. If you want quality and authentic look to places that are more middle eastern like HAji Baba, Mijana and Tasty Kabob"
0,"If you're expecting competitive pricing, excellent communication and quality installation for your granite project.\nAVOID THIS COMPANY!!\nOnce you've signed the contract, you will not receive any communication, I had to prod information from the sales representative Tina. We were never told what to expect, ever. I upgraded an island edge myself after the original quotation that added to the cost, never was it recommended by the sales representative. Now at this point I am questioning their professionalism and became concerned.  I checked their pricing and they were higher than two other quotes I received.  When I asked if they would price match, I was told by the owner Dan that I could cancel the contract for a $300 cancellation charge and at the time they had not spent a penny on the project yet.\nThe template maker either failed to make correct templates or the cutters did not follow the templates as the sections were off by 1/2\"" at the joint and they just filled it with caulking, unreal!!!\n I had to give quality an F because the installation was so sloppy, one of the installers washed the epoxy they used to install the sink off of his hands with acetone and pored it all over my new floors. I informed the sales representative about the stains on my floors and she said she would tell the owner Dan, I have not heard a thing from Dan, nor do I expect to. The caulking all had to be redone and a section was missed completely. There was epoxy left all over the tops and sink, that I had to clean off. The installation crew has no process for covering up anything and really did not care at all. The granite fabricators do not deserve this score however, their work was fine.\nThis company does not care about you as a consumer, read their other reviews, I only review excellent or awful experiences. This was an awful experience. When I asked about the negative reviews and his employees lack of enthusiasm, communication, and quality of workmanship, I was told by owner Dan \""we're only human, we make mistakes\"" \nWhat a cop out Dan, everything we experienced could be corrected with leadership!\n\nUPDATE\n\nThe nightmare continues, on New Years Day our sink fell down, I had asked the installers if they were going to use the factory installation brackets provided by the sink manufacturer and they said they use epoxy and have never had one fall off.\nI read the installation process for correctly installing our very expensive Blanco stainless steel sink and epoxy was no where in the instructions. I had to do the installation from under my sink, and although very difficult to do this way, it is done correctly. Dan will reply with apologies and say he stands behind his work, I however choose not to have them ever return to my home for anything,\nPlease people: DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY"
0,"It's big, it's new, its awkward. \nDon't get me wrong, I'm about as awkward as a virgin in college but when it comes to casinos - it should ooze cool, sex should be pouring out of the wallpaper and the drink girls should scream \""bend me over on your knee and call me susan\"". This casino lacks an overall theme, a personality, and to get from 1 location to another requires a mile walk. \nFor what the casino/hotel lacks in personality and convenience, I must say their service people were pretty nice - except for one of the cab guys that seemed annoyed that I wanted to handle my own baggage where I hear him say \""Some ppl just don't understand this is how we make a living\"". \nSo Aria, you are a song that I won't press repeat on sorry."
1,"As a 20 year resident of Scottsdale, I remember this location being a pottery shop for the longest time.\n\nIt's nice to see them redevelop the building into a cozy Mexican restaurant.  The patio and outside bar are good areas to enjoy a meal when the weather is nice.\n\nThe prices are reasonable and I enjoyed my skirt steak rice bowl with stewed beans.  The flavors and the different sauces that you can add make for a nice option without the heavy sauces and cheese that come on dishes at most Mexican restaurants.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my experience here and plan to return."
1,"After seeing a lot of airports and going through a lot of security checks, I've decided that LAS is the one of the best airports on the west coast. Check-in is always under 15 minutes if you don't bring crazy stuff in your bag and remember to take your laptop out. It's easy to navigate. There are a lot of places to eat, and plenty of places to charge your phone/laptop. AND FREE WI-FI! :]"
0,Worst customer service ever!
0,Terrible customer service each time I've come to this place.  Only gave 2 stars because I like firehouse and my subs are always good but I've never been greeted by employees here when I walk in. Will not return. Subway it is!
0,"Automatic 20% gratuity on parties of 5 and more.  No separate checks.  Tiny tiny portions for the money.  Seriously, $15 for 2 corn tortilla enchiladas.  The rice was hard, the beans were dry.  A message that says, \""one complimentary refill of chips and salsa.\""  Who charges extra for chips and salsa?  At a mexican restaurant...and one that' s much more expensive and less than average quality.  Seriously, I love my fellow yelpers, but this is not authentic mexican food.  It's just bad.  I understand that Phoenix has much to be desired in this area, but yeah.  To be fair this was just one time here....they may just be inconsistent and have good food other nights, but the portions are not likely to change."
0,"Was fairly empty... Hostess sat us next to the kitchen anyway... Waiter was preoccupied with conversations with what seemed to be the manager... Forgot to put our order in... Food was really late, with no apology...  The food was ok... Pizza is the best thing we ordered... Our bill was $120 for 4 people with a bottle of wine... Not bad but the service and vibe was really bad."
1,"I love me some TCBY. I've come here at least 10-15 times since the place opened. The decor is very nice, and is hip and modern. There are a lot of flavors to choose from, from root beer float to vanilla to tart. Some of the flavors are great, some are just plain bad. There are a wide variety of toppings, including fresh fruit and loads of candy. The yogurt tastes good, although it could be a little more creamy. It's a great alternative to heavy, thick ice cream."
1,"We had Jessica, she was great! Our 14 month old boy's haircut turned out perfectly and she was very patient with him wiggling around! He had his first haircut at a different location and I didn't like how it turned out, but I read good reviews about this location and Jessica, so we gave it a shot. Glad we did! We'll be back!"
0,"This place has gone down.  It was never spectacular but it was a good place for a burger.  The staff is indifferent about service.  Even though they have a number system to let waitstaff know where to bring food my burger went to another table. The person opened my burger and told the waitress it wasn't their burger.  Then she brought it to me. After some strange person touched the food, she still wanted to give it to me.  As she gave it to me she told me it was my burger with no lettuce.  Not only was there lettuce on the burger it was mixed in with the fries.  She rolled her eyes and huffed as I told her there was no lettuce.    \n\nThe food in general was less than ok.  Burger and fries were cold.  In fact the fries were not cooked all the way.  \n\nI needed another napkin and got up to get one. There were only 2 dispenser, one on each end of the place. A waitress fussed at me for getting my napkin.  Apparently the one I used was for employee's only.  \n\nWith some good competition around them their standards are not enough."
0,Pricey for smoke meat place at 20$ for sandwich coke fries and pickle...  Smoked meat has no taste . Go to Schwartz wait in line u will love your smoked meat much more there...
0,"We stopped in here last weekend for a quick bite before meeting friends.  The restaurant itself is cool, hip and modern.  Service was very good too.  \n\nThe real issue was with the food.  We ordered the mac n' cheese and the sliders.  Both were incredibly underseasoned.  I think the food has potential but I'm wondering if they had a substitute cook that day."
1,"Hang with me here..... I had a vertebrate paleontology class in college.  Our professor often discussed the lack of evolutionary changes in crocodilian species over the course of millions of years while other species have evolved all sorts of other features.  He basically said \""it's not possible to do what they do any better.  A bigger brain means they'd probably lose jaw muscle.  Larger body size means they'd probably lose some of their ability to sneak up on prey.  Over the course of millions of years, these things would be a big deal.\""  Point being, crocodiles haven't evolved because they're perfect as is for what they do.  Well, for what it is, Which Wich does a perfect job.\n\nTons of options, all completely customizeable, fairly fast service, high quality ingredients, toasting capabilities, inexpensive, friendly staff that aren't afraid to interact with their customers, etc.  Perfect lunch spot.  It can get crowded (obviously a good problem to have), so come during off hours or plan on getting it to go."
1,"Open 24 hours. The cafe is called Images & located in the back. Old school feel & look to it all. 2nd hand smoke galore.\n\nMy fiance and I went there because I was craving liver and she found out that they are one of the few places which still serve it. I was not disappointed. Bonus!: the french dip she ordered was A-mazing.\n\nTheir service was fantastic as well. Our waitress, Christina, took pride in her work and paid close attention to detail. We even noticed her send a few dishes back to the cooks because they weren't to her standard.\n\nWe can't wait to go back to experience this hidden jewel again.  I'm thinking: late night slice of pie and coffee at their counter. How about that?!?"
1,"As you walk in to Ennio's, you are greeted by a great mature atmosphere as well as a warm front of house. The wait is usually not long and seats are available almost right away. \n\nI ordered the calamari for appetizer and Spaghetti A'Matricianna for entre. My gf had the Bambino pizza. The calamari was slightly greasy but nicely flavoured. My spaghetti was delicious, but a bit heavy on the sauce. The bambino pizza was apparently quite delicious.\n\nOverall a very pleasant experience"
1,"Great Italian food with portions designed to share.\n\nAnd it was a good thing our waiter brought that to our attention (he must have heard our comments on the prices).  We ordered 2 half portions and one full (lobster ravioli, a brick of lasagna, and something else I couldn't pronounce) and it was just enough for the 4 of us.  After the alcohol we even kept the bill under $100.  I would definately recommend this place, just be sure to bring a few friends and an appetite!"
1,"BJ's always has good food but the service is usually sub-par. This place would get 5 stars if they could just improve in that area. I like their salads, burgers, pizzas and they also have some pretty good lemonades."
0,"I ordered the top sirloin medium rare. When I cut into it I discovered it was well done! A server did not come around until 15 minutes later. By then I had decided to try it. Dry and tough!!!! The server ask if I wanted another, but my friends were almost done with their meal. So I just told her I was very disappointed and did not finish the steak. No compensation was made. I guess BJ's us just not a place for steak. Very disappointing."

0,"I love their smoothies, but unfortunately they have no customer service skills. I went in with my sister after our workout and they were taking forever to make our drinks and then my sis thought her drink was ready and it wasn't. ..it was \""the managers\"" drink. They need someone with good management skills to run that place."
0,"Everything was spectacular EXCEPT the medical care I received. The waiting room, exam room, and restroom were spotless, and the MA and office staff were nice. The PA who was working on the day I COMPLETELY BLEW ME OFF. Ignored my symptoms, and told me that what I'd already done to relieve my symptoms were pointless (I know enough being raised by a NP to know that they weren't). She didn't even do an exam until I ASKED HER TO. She didn't ask me any questions, and didn't listen it what I was saying. She offered a shot of a pain killer and I told her that I wasn't interested in pain relief...I wanted to take care of what was causing the pain...a few minutes later the MA walked in with the shot. ATE YOU KIDDING ME? WAS SHE EVEN LISTENING?! WebMD will be more helpful than this place."
1,"This place just opened up, it's located in the AJ's anchored shopping center at Scottsdale Road & Lone Mountain.  Tom and his wife opened an upscale nail salon and they are great at customer service.  It was a great relaxing experience...  I'll be back."
1,consistently good food and service
1,"I am in the process of switching from Skank of America so I opened an account here. The service here is very friendly and personalized and unlike a big corporate bank, most of my requests are greeted with a yes and more often than not, are handled and carried out by a friendly associate as opposed to being told how I can go home and do it myself online.\n\nAlso, there seems to NEVER be a crowd at this location so I am usually in and out in 5 minutes instead of waiting in a long line for one of two tellers to look after me. A very refreshing banking experience"
1,"Rice paper is within walking distance of our house. I'm surprised I haven't rated them, yet! When they opened we went 2-3 times a week (I kid you not). They are basically a spring-roll bar, not a restaurant, but they do offer the experience of fine dining. They have happy hour and drink specials daily (which is great, as their cocktails are delicious and on the pricey side: $9-$13).\n\nI'm a vegetarian and am so happy with their menu! Their veggie spring rolls are DELICIOUS. Their noodle dishes are so good and they are very helpful with subbing tofu/etc for meat. They even offer a vegetarian pho! The boyfriend loves meat and he always leaves happy. Their rolls, sandwiches, pho, and dishes are great. Have not tried the salads -- but I'm sure they're just as great.\n\nI took my mom here for her birthday. She's never had thai food before and she loved it!! We are happy, loyal customers. Be prepared to spend at least $20 each if you are getting drinks but it is worth it."
1,"I have been a member of Mountainside for a little over a year now. I love the location! Its halfway between my house and work, which is perfect for me! I also love how all the cardio equipment has a TV on it! It makes the pain and little less! I feel like they are really clean and everything is up-to-date!\n\nThe down side is that they are really expensive. I wish they had a pool to make everything worth while! I also wish they would leave the towels in the bathroom. Its a pain they keep them up front. Why do they even do that anyways? Also, my main concern is the times they have for their classes. I wish they would have a yoga, cycle or fitness class in the afternoon! All they have is from 9-10 to 4-6. Would it really be that hard to have a class twice a week between 12-3??"
0,"I've never left a review on yelp, but felt like I had to after this experience. I used this Petsmart Grooming back in December. My dog came home with a red irritated butt where they had shaved her. By the next day there were little bumps all over and they increased in number and ugliness over that day. I called them to tell them I was taking her to my vet and they said bring her to Banfield and they'd take a look. They admitted no fault except that maybe the clippers irritated her skin and gave me an antibiotic and ointment. Months have gone by and I've made numerous trips to my vet and tried 3 different antibiotics. I don't know what was on those clippers or how/if they clean them, but clearly something caused an infection that antibiotics are not killing. My vet is now taking cultures and testing for mhrsa. After this ordeal I would never recommend Petsmart grooming."
0,Was threatened to have my car towed because I stepped away for no more than two minutes to look for the valets. Had a 30 minute wait to check in. Despite what the website and signage tell you it costs $22 to use the gym. It's the year 2014 and WiFi costs $15 a day. Shampoo but no conditioner. Oh and when I walked into my room for the first time there was a blueberry in the bathroom sink. All in all Bally's made for a genuine WTF experience. With all the options in Vegas I say anywhere but here.
0,"We went there on 9/26/14 with a party of 5 at 10:10pm.  The restaurant supposed to close at 11:00 pm.  When we walked in the waiter gave us a dirty look,  We asked for drinks and he told us all they get is soft drinks.  We ordered 3 won ton noodle and one beef brisket noodle soup.  The soup was luke warm and the won ton was not even heat all the way through.  Tjhe beef brisket was very fatty in a bad way,  The soup had no taste,  When we were half way through our meal the waiter said they had to closed down the register and want us to pa right the wayy.  The other staff was all standing in the dining room and staring at us while we eat.  Overall, the food was bad and expensive for what it was and the service was horrible and they only take CASH.  Would not recommend anyone go there and waste their money.  It is too bad they carry Sam Woo's name and this might lead customers think they are all the same quality.  The ones in LA are much better in terms of food quality and serive."
1,"This is a great hotel but they have been raising the rates through the roof lately (and I'm not sure the new prices are worth it)! I love how gorgeous everything is - the decorations are impeccable - but I was able to stay in a corner suite at the Aria next door for less than a standard room at the Cosmopolitan my last trip. Needless to say, given the choice, I'd stay in the corner suite every time. \n\nBut the Cosmopolitan staff is super friendly and even if you don't stay here, I'd definitely recommend walking through (especially if you are with a bachelorette party - all those sparkles!). I love the chandeliers and casino. They also have great restaurants and a very cool pool. Hopefully they will stop price gouging and I can stay there again."
0,"DH & I went for dinner there tonight, we had a veggie pasty and the crust was nice & flaky but the stuffing of the pasty was tasteless, peas were tasteless, mashed potatoes & gravy, weren't very good either. Beer selection was good, but food was terrible."
0,"I'll preface this by saying that I NEVER write reviews; so, the fact that I feel compelled to do so today...should say something. \n\nThe girl who works here does an awesome job -- she's very meticulous and the end result is great. My star goes directly to her. \n\nThat said, my biggest pet peeve about this place is that they keep the most random hours! Why bother posting business hours on the door when they are very RARELY adhered to? I've attempted to come here a handful of times, at different times of the day, only to be met with locked doors. They don't even have an answering machine/voicemail! Completely unprofessional and frustrating, to say the least. Not to mention a waste of time/gas! \n\nI've tried to look past this before because I actually like the threading results; but, honestly, it's just not worth the trouble anymore. Moving on..."
0,"I've stayed at places that's a little more expensive but I wanted to see what I would get for $25/night.  On the travel sites, the hotel is rated 3 stars and reviewers have rated it 3.5 stars.  \""That's not bad.  How bad can it be?\""  \n\nThe place is cheap and you get what you paid for.  But a used dried up condom under the bed in one room and blood stained mattress in the other?  Are you kidding me?!?  The mattress was just flipped over cause the other side was \""cleaner\"" or stain free.\n\nThe hotel moved us to other rooms but can you imagine other people that stayed in that same room, sleeping with a used condom a foot and half from their head.  Gross!!\n\nCheck you bed before jumping in, you never know who's biological fluids you're sleeping with."
1,"We went here on Memorial Day weekend, so we knew it would be expensive, but we didn't care.  Paid $225 for a daybed + umbrella, and about $150 for drinks on top of that.  Had a great time!  Staff was friendly, people were friendly.  At first my wife was the only topless female in the place, but as the day went on and more people came in there were many more.  Great service -- worth the price for a topless pool in Vegas.  \n\nGood points:  \n-No kids!\n-Not as crowded as the main pool in Mandalay Bay.\n-Great food and drinks.\n-Good service.\n-Good location.\n\nBad points:\n-No shade.  We had an umbrella - but it was positioned on the east side of our bed.  When the pool opened at 11am we had some shade, but as the day went on we lost all of our shade.\n-Expensive.  But, for Vegas, it seems comparable..\n\nWe ended up meeting another couple in the pool there and that subsequently led to a great night -- but that's another story.  Anyway, we highly recommend the Moorea Beach Club!"
1,"I've liked everything I have tried.\nThe sashimi seems fresh.\nChef's special sushi or sashimi sampler is the way to go if you don't know what you might like. \nThe fried veggie tempura is a tasty appetizer to try, but not very healthy. \n\nIf you are worried about calories beware that a lot of rolls have spicy mayo, cream cheese, avocado, or battered/fried fish. not all tho, you can get sashimi or lighter sushi rolls. \n\nThe only complaint that I have is that they only have one chef, and one night I had to wait almost an hour for my appetizer because they had a 12+ people order placed online ahead of mine. They were very apologetic and gave me a free roll. However, I left after the appetizer (and free roll), and I had planned on spending at least $30 more dollars. So I guess they sometimes have more business than they can handle."

0,"A Co-worker of mine lamented last week \""have you tried Humble Pie?, it's said to be the best pizza in Scottsdale.\"" I had a hard time believing this, better than Grimaldi's? Better than Nello's? Then I hoped on Yelp, saw some favorable reviews and decided, hey maybe it is!! So Husband and I ventured up north to the Tatum location on Saturday night. We instantly  noticed the open kitchen centered around the wood oven, the place was hoping. This must be good. After waiting for what seemed like several minutes the waitress finally arrived to take our drink order. Husband ordered and Shiner Hefe and I went with the featured Limoncello Margarita. Several minutes passed once again, and finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken. The first sip I took of my cocktail was like a punch in the gut. I am all for strong drinks, better value. This was strong to the point that it really was not enjoyable. Figuring it may take awhile we started with the antipasto board. I ordered the Egg pizza, Husband seemed delighted by the idea of the Coppa pizza. When the Antipasto arrived we were pleased, it was simple and amazing. Small bites of meats, cheeses, olives, marinated tomatoes accompanied by crusty bread. Now, slow, inattentive service, and bad cocktail aside, we were ready for the pizza. My pizza of whole mozzarella and prosciutto was topped with a sunny side up egg. It was good not great, the egg added a nice flavor that complemented the smokey prosciutto and crust. It did seem however it was really salty. I know prosciutto is a salty meat, but this tasted like the cheese and crust were carrying a good dose\n, just in case. I asked husband about his pizza, and he commented the same, very salty. We finished what we could of our salt licks and waited, and waited for our bill. I wanted to really like this place, but the slow service and salty pie left me feeling very meh, While the antipasto was good for my money I will take Grimaldi's, Nello's, La Grande Orange or Bianco any day."
1,"Cheskie's is a Jewish bakery, not a typical Montreal patisserie/bakery. I must admit that I don't have much of a point of reference as I don't typically frequent Jewish bakeries. Furthermore I only purchase one item a Cheskie's and I don't even know what it's real name is. I call it the 'Chocolate Bomb'. They sit in a big tray on the back counter and I think that there is a second flavour, caramel or cinnamon or some such thing. I did try that once and it is not as good as the chocolate. \n\nYes there are many other items at Checkie's that look very tasty and each time I head over there I think to my self 'I'll give something new a try today'. Then I see my 'Chocolate Bomb' and I can't take my eyes off of it. I start thinking about how wonderfully packed full of chocolate it is and how the dough is so sweet and moist and how every bite will just melt in your mouth. Before I know it, I've ordered the 'Chocolate Bomb' and again not given something else a try."
0,"Not happy at all. My son bought his second Ipod a year ago. The first broke, and when we took it to the apple store, they said \""tough luck.\"" So, I told my son to make sure to take really good care of the new one. He did. For no reason, it stopped working. We sent it to be repaired and got it back saying \""water damage.\"" No way. So we went to the store and told them about it. The floor guy said to wait and he'd have a \""genius\"" look at it. He came back and said \""no water damage. Make an appt for tonight and they'll fix it.\"" Went back, saw a \""genius\"" and told him the story. Without looking at it, he said must be water damage. We said impossible. He said well, this square hole will be red if it's water damage...yup, water damage. I took the flashlight from his hand and looked. It was white. I know red from white, and this was white. Oh, he said, I meant that there's a little red line. No red line. Oh, I meant that there's a red corner. No red corner. He shows it to someone who glances and says yup, red. This is nuts. Talk about spitting in your face and saying it's raining. They insist it's red and there's water damage and won't look into why this well taken care of ipod won't work. Son not allowed to buy another one. MP3 next."
1,"WOW, let me tell you! Travis and I had one of the best dates Friday night and it all started at La Piccola's! Friendly service take us 'to the best table in the house' and at first I thought they were just joking around, but they bring us into this cute little room and seat us in a window seat next to a fountain glowing with simple lights. \n\nWe ordered the Hummus appetizer - it was served with warm pita pieces. It was full of flavor and deliciously combined with baba ganoush. Yum\n\nThen we moved onto dinner, I ordered the Turkey Roast with Raspberry Pepper Sauce - WOW! The turkey was tender and full of flavor, but not over-spiced. The combination of flavor when I used the Raspberry Pepper sauce was incredible. My Greek salad was amazing with the home-made dressing and the grill asparagus were perfect.\n\nTo top it all off, we ended the evening's dining with some Gelato. The food, service, and ambients was as good as it gets for me!\n\nYou can tell everything is home-made because at the end of my meal, I was full and well-fed but not bloated or weighed down by grease and salt. La Piccola Cucina has become my newest favorite in Italian restaurants and I'm excited to go back and try something new."

We shared a salad which was delicious and a Margarita Pizza, well we ordered one to share and it was soo good we ended up getting another one and sharing that as well!!\n\nIt was about $30, not too bad....\n\nOn our way out we asked what the difference between virgin olive oil and extra virgin olive oil... the pizza maker guy knew they difference and we walked out of there full and a little smarter!!!\n\nI would have to say the reviews are pretty right on, i would recommend this place to anyone who wants good, authentic thin crust pizza!!!"
0,"I took my friend to the Mercy Gilbert Emergency Room and I was very surprised at how callously she was treated.  She was in severe pain and was placed in a bed about 10 feet from the nurse's station.  \n\nWhile she lay suffering, the nurses were loudly discussing their weekend plans without any regard for her.  \""I'm going out with Josh tonight!\""  \""I've been checking flights for my trip.\""  \n\nWhen I requested a cup of water for my friend, they told me no and instructed me to get back behind the curtain.\n\nThis went on for an hour and these nurses couldn't have cared any less.  \n\nI was further shocked when the hospital's Director of Customer Experience told me that the hospital is known for pain management.

1,Amazing experience! Came with a large party and had no issues. Server was polite and accommodating to everyone. We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and truffle fries as appetizers. Tried several different burgers and there was not a single disappointed person in our group. Great mix of flavors! Great quality! Cannot wait to go again and try more of the menu. Highly recommended!
1,This is a great local business with a very knowledgeable staff. I walk away from Harper's with very reasonably priced plants/trees (the competitor/chain up the road has ridiculous prices for the same trees!) and the know-how to take care of them. Would recommend visiting this place just to tour their lush grounds and relax.
1,"Sometimes they have additional 30, 40 or 50% off clearance items depending on the season.\n\nI found a pair of lightwash destroyed \""erin\"" skinny jeans for under 10 bucks in the clearance section way in the back.\nScore!\n\nXS sell out really fast.\nIf you're a size M or L, some good deals in the clearance section if you look"
0,"We were only in for a drink. The server looked and acted as if she did not need the hassle of having to serve us or speak to us or offer any form of hospitality. My gin and tonic was really flat, but I couldn't bear facing her miserable attitude again by complaining. The food menu read really self-indulgent and mega-overpriced outrageous pricing. The place was filthy dirty, floors, walls and bathrooms, and staff did not care. It wasn't busy, 5pm on a Friday. All the marketing smacks of desperation and I have no idea who they are targeting. Not us, for sure. Got out asap to no farewell, as expected."
0,Our meal looked nothing like the pictures people have posted. The service was terrible and I wasn't impressed the the food. Definitely won't go back.
0,"My husband, some friends and I went to this place for restaurant week. We all sampled different dishes to experience a range of items - the multi-flavored french fries, soups, steaks and desserts. While everything we sampled was good, I was not blown away. My steak was good, but not great, and considering the regular prices, great should be on the menu. Also, the restaurant is one main room with hardwood floors, effectively creating an echo-chamber. This is one of my major restaurant pet peeves - you sit down at a nice dinner only to have to yell across the table. I expected more from Michael Mina and certainly for the celebrity chef-inspired prices. A better steak, and better experience, can certainly be had for less."
1,Went here for the first time a couple of weeks ago. Nice interior and a good varied menu. The special of the day was a lovely venison steak. The staff were  friendly and helpful. Nice central location if you plan on going out afterwards in the Grassmarket/Royal Mile area.
0,"Allow me to jump over the food review and skip to the end of my visit to where I was surrounded by security guards, the restaurant manager, and the casino manager. They were ineptly attempting to figure out how to handle an irate customer (me). As you can see, this was not a pleasant experience at a well-run establishment. Nope, it was a horrible evening at a piece of shit crap factory. Now back to the beginning...\n\nTHE ORDER: I ordered the ribeye with garlic mashed potatoes, garlic green beans, and added a lobster tail. My wife ordered the same, except with the sirloin. One daughter had a sirloin, and the other had a chicken panini with soup.\n\nTHE QUALITY: My daughters' meals were alright. The lobster was alright. The mashed potatoes and green beans were alright. My steak and my wife's steak were NOT alright. The ribeye was ALL FAT. Okay, that's an exaggeration. I was able to find approximately 4 bites on it that I was able to eat. The rest was fat, and I could not eat it. I have attached a picture of it. I understand that ribeye is a fattier cut of meat. It is one of my favorites. It is the cut I get every time I eat steak. This steak was not a cut that should have been served to anybody.\n\nMy wife's sirloin was inedible due to chewiness. I don't have a picture of hers, but just imagine a piece of meat with 5 bites taken out of it, and all 5 bites spit back onto the plate.\n\nTHE COMPLAINT: I asked a server to speak with the manager. About 4 minutes later a guy walks up, and asks what the problem is. I tell him that my ribeye is inedible due to the amount of fat. He simply says, \""okay\"" and walks away. The table of 4 just seated next to us overhear this and ask about the bad steak. I show them my food and they are immediately interested in the goings-on.\n\nTHE ESCALATION: About 3 minutes later the pompous Japanese manager reappears and says, \""I will remove the lobster from your bill\"". I pick up the uneaten steak and say, \""How about you remove this from the bill. I can't eat it\"". He goes into an explanation of how they receive the meat and cut it there, and the cut you get is the cut you get. I then pick up the steak and tell him, \""You need to tell your cooks that when they pick up a cut of meat like this, do not cook it. Throw it out. Do not serve it to a customer\"". I said \""This piece of meat is shit\"". He told me if I speak to him like that, he is going to leave the entire bill with NO reductions and make me pay the whole thing. I say, \""F*#$ YOU\"". He says \""Okay, here's your whole bill. Pay it\"". I place it on the floor and tell him \""That's where it's going to stay. I'm not paying it\"". He says \""I'm going to call casino security\"". I tell him \""Alright\"". The table of 4 just seated next to us witness all of this and get up and leave, saying that they can't believe a restaurant would treat a customer like that.\n\nWe watch the pompous Japanese restaurant manager walk to the hostess booth and use the telephone. A few minutes later two guys from casino security show up as well as the casino manager.\n\nTHE RESOLUTION: My wife decides to jump in and save the day. I take our daughters and stand in the lobby area in order to remove myself from the situation. My wife listens as pompous Japanese manager tells casino manager that I devoured all the food on my plate, then screamed profanities at him in an attempt to get a free meal. None of that is true. She walks the casino manager to our table and shows him our plates of food. He then instructs the restaurant to remove our steaks from the bill and tells my wife that I am banned in the future.\n\nTHE VERDICT: This restaurant is a fine establishment with excellent food and an extremely courteous staff is what I WOULD say if it were true. Unfortunately, this is a piece of crap excuse for a restaurant serving garbage on a plate with a staff who make Hitler look like a fun play date. My wife says she would have rather dumpster dived for her meal. DO NOT EAT HERE. I can't emphasize that enough. DO NOT EAT HERE. But DO stop in briefly and tell the pompous Japanese manager \""Hee Haw\"" because he is a total donkey. I will send a special gift to anybody who goes in, says \""Hee Haw\"" to the pompous Japanese manager, and reports it on this review."
1,"This place had really great food. I was very surprised, that's a good sign that people know about it when on Monday night there are no tables to be had at 8:00 PM! I would recommend the ribs, or the beer can chicken. Those were my two favorites. And the mac & cheese is really good too!"
1,"Close by to my work, we often stop here for happy hour, since there's more than a few scotch aficionados at the office and L'ile noire has an excellent selection. From time to time, they'll have live music as well, so ends up been a pretty fun place to hang out.\n\nWhile I'm not the biggest Scotch drinker, they do have a decent selection of beers to choose from.\n\nPlus, it's super close to the Metro for you to get safely home =)"
0,"Let me just say, I love cafe rio. Order all the time. Today, I went into the one on Maryland and I never seen more rudeness than I did today. As I watched one of the workers ask Sonya for help, she basically said no ask someone else. While Sonya was saying no to help one of her fellow employees out, I watched as she rolled up silverware for a catering order. 1. She has no gloves on, 2. She was coughing all over the utensils. I feel so bad for who Evers catering order she was taken care of. Once again, Sonya was asked for help and she yet again said no. I felt horrible for the woman asking for help. I will not be returning to that location."
0,"Within 10 minutes all of us got sick, don't know if it was the undercooked burgers or the parmesan truffle French Fries. I see from the reviews below that we are not the only ones that got a touch of food poisoning from this place. We did tell the management later that day after we all purged and they did offer us a refund, we declined. I don't need a free lunch.  Just make it good!!\n\nThere are too many great places to eat in Vegas; this is not one of them."
1,"I have been to Ti Amo several times over the years and it never fails to deliver. \n\nSituated in the centre of the busy and bustling Nicolson Street, Ti Amo is just across the road from the main University campus George Square and it is just a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach. \n\nThe decor inside is very authentic Italian, with Italian music playing in the background which gives the restaurant a great atmosphere. It looks quite small from the outside, but the restaurant is on two floors so it is very spacious inside and has a large capacity so it would be an ideal place for a big group of people. \n\nTi Amo offer a very extensive menu with authentic Italian dishes, including pizzas, pastas, risotto and a good selection of different meat dishes. I had the marinated olives to start when I came here which were really tasty, and too oily which was good. But my main course was by far the superior dish. I had the Four Seasons pizza which was absolutely gorgeous. The pizza base was really thin and perfectly cooked without any burnt bits and they didn't skimp on the topping and cheese, which always gets a bug thumbs up from me. The portion sizes are really decent and the prices are really reasonable too with most main course costing about \u00a37. \n\nThe staff are really friendly and accommodating and make you feel that nothing is too much trouble for them - amazing! A great Italian restaurant which I am definitely going back to."
1,"Loved Ronde.\n\nPopped in for a browse and coffee. My Dad is a cyclist and I wanted to pick up something a bit extra for his birthday. I had already gotten a voucher for a local (to him) bike shop but came here and had kit envy. Great range of clothing and accessories and my Dad liked his thermal socks. \n\nSeriously high end kit and bikes though. If you want to pay several hundred quid for tyres, this is the place to come. Small range of women's clothing but what they had made me want to rush out and buy a bike and be a bike fashionista, roaming around the city. Cute range of cards for cyclists and some of the posters and art work was lovely.\n\nStayed for coffee - great and ended up tempted by the soup (think it is by Union of Genius) as it was Ghanian chicken and peanut. Busy cafe with locals and cyclists popping in. \n\nWorth a visit and when the bike races are on, they show them in store. I'm sure I'll be popping in again."
1,"Visiting the other neck of the woods I was in the mood for a healthy alternative to traditional fast food. I'm not a fast foodie by any means but dinner time ran late and this girl wasn't in the mood to cook. \n\nProtein on the go! Strip N Dip offers healthy alternatives to the traditional (and most often) delicious deep friend chicken strips.  I ordered the baked AND grilled chicken strips (had to quality control them both), and I was pleasantly surprised by their flavor minus the delicious sauce options.  \n\nA diverse selection of sauce options, veggies or carb-filled sides (mac & cheese, fries..) and garlic bread come with every order.\n\nFor the price and the food quality it's a nice alternative to traditional fast food.\n\nThe venue itself is filled with sass and the staff was nothing short of what customer service SHOULD be in this town."
1,Really nice outdoor patio. Sunday drink special on whiskey was really good. Very reasonable price for uptown. Nice variations on Irish cuisine.  Worth checking out!
0,"Because of their restaurant policy, I give it two stars because of the bartender. \n\nI came here to do the bar menu and have a few drinks for my BIRTHDAY..I thought the bar menu was from 4:00-6:00pm but it was 3:00-5:00pm. We had arrived at 4:15pm and ALL seats at the bar were taken but there were small tables next to the bar that were EMPTY.  \n\nI asked the host if we could sit at one of the small tables and he informed us that ALL tables are for DINNER ONLY and it starts at 5:00 pm. ( he wasn't the most friendly) Well there goes that plan. No one would be leaving the BAR and then the menu would be over. I have never heard of a restaurant that ONLY provides seats at the \""literal\"" bar when they are serving their bar menu. Maybe they do things differently in CA.\n\nPlan B: Go to the Bellagio fountain show..which was wonderful as they had the show to the tune Lady Luck by Frank Sinatra..ahh...classic Vegas..on the way back, we walked past OLives and I thought well I have to at least get a birthday drink and they had 2 seats open. The bartender poured well ..got our money's worth, not watered down like most restaurants ( that is why I make my own most of the time). Didn't have dinner, too expensive and needed a reservation though the seating was practically empty for the tables..went to see the Monet exhibit and get dessert elsewhere.."
1,Decent enough place although it's a tad on the pricy side.  What I do find amazing is their pizza tastes 2x better after it's been refrigerated.  Amazingly good when you have it for leftovers.
1,"I had a groupon for colon hydrotherapy, and my experience was good. There are a lot of negative reviews for this place at their old address, so to their credit I wanted to tell my experience.  After making my appointments, I got follow up confirmations via email. These emails said no food at least two hours before the appointment.  I also got reminder emails right before my appointment. When I got there, the office was small but clean and quiet, New-age music in the background.  The therapist was extremely informative and kind. I was told up front that one appointment wouldn't take care of my problems, but it would take several. I already knew and understood that, don't expect to get totally cleaned out with one or even two visits.  They even gave me a dvd to take home.  The only reason I didn't do 5 stars is because it was kind of a hassle getting the appointments. No one ever answered the phone when I first called.  I had to leave a message and it took them about 4 days to get back to me. But once I got in they treated me great and even spared me my dignity. I will go back for sure."
1,"Ok, so i read through some of the previous reviews and i agree that sometimes the establishment can be dirty(bathrooms) and the service is sometimes not perfect....but that doesn't really change how i feel about the food. I grew up in the midwest with all extended family in the south....Stacy's is the place if you remember or EVER enjoyed true Southern Style BBQ...It took me almost 6 yrs to find Stacy's...and it was for their Fried Catfish, fried in the skillet with cornmeal; this is nowhere else to be found except in the south...love the fried pickles(cornmeal as well). I have tried their sandwhiches and ribs and it takes me back to the times our family would stop on the side of the highways in Tennesse @ BBQ shacks to get pulled beef/ pork by the pound and the tradition of all southern family's frying catfish with cornmeal in an ol cast iron skillet...I love this place! Thanks Stacy for making me head back to my childhood"
1,"Bring 8 people and order one of everything on the menu, I have....you will not be disappointed. Get in early or make a reservation."
1,"It's still as divey as ever here at La Bayou Casino.  It's run down, cramped and there's dusty stuff all over the walls and ceilings.  God knows I love this place!  It's one of the coolest places in downtown Vegas and they always get my business.\n\nFrom the time you walk in the door and get your beads and raffle ticket till the time you leave, it's non-stop free drinks, cool employees and loose slots.\n\nYou know how most casinos only offer you free drinks when you are playing the $1 slots or better.  Not here!  I walked up, got some Mardi Gras beads and before I could sit down they asked me what I wanted to drink.  I hadn't gotten half way done and she are offering me another drink.  These ladies usually come by about once every 10 minutes so drink fast and get your moneys worth.  By the way, these aren't pussy drinks either - you can taste the alcohol.\n\nTheir slot machines are usually pretty loose (not this time but usually).  The machines are retro coin payers so don't be looking for slots with tie ins to the latest movies or TV shows and be sure to have a cup or two handy for your big win.\n\nLike I said before, I'm still loving Barbara (manager) and Mary Ellen (cashier).  They are part of the experience and if they ever leave, the place just won't be the same.\n\nMan I want to go back there right now."

0,"I heard great things about Price's. A colleague invited me to lunch one day and I finally got to try it. Unfortunately, I wasn't very impressed. I wanted to like the food- but I just didn't. Maybe I'm spoiled by my moms southern fried chicken recipe.  :)\n\nAdditionally, it didn't sit well with my stomach. Yikes! But if your stomach can endure lots of grease, you may like it."
0,"I may be a poop in a group but the Siren's of Treasure Island could of been a wee bit better. It was hot, crowded and one could not really see the whole show. The story line is lame. The main girl's voice sounded like a dudes.  The really funny thing it that this was a live performance and no one clapped at the end or even yelled Yahhhh. How ever the fire show next door at the Mirage....when it ended with no live performers, and no story line..... people yelled, clapped and cheered.....  Kind of funny how Vegas is.  Maybe in the future Treasure Island will change the Pirate Show. But for know it is just OK in my book...... The fun of Treasure Island however is inside.... so much to see and do...... skip the show and just go inside....."
1,Awesome pool. I go here every summer on my own as well as with a group of children.  \n\nI like that this pool has ample chairs to sit around the kiddie area so I could watch my kids.  What I DON'T like is that the lifeguards are all clueless.  There are times when we'd be sitting in the shallow end and almost get knocked down by kids who were fighting in the area. We even mentioned it to the lifeguards on duty and they don't seem to care.
1,Love this place! It's my favorite! My roommate and I come once a week. Best sushi in town!
0,"I used to take my all of my dry cleaning here all the time until they LOST my jacket. When I went to drop of my items, I was given two claim tickets since the other item required a repair. Both articles of clothing were going to be ready on the same day. When I went to pick it up on Saturday morning, the young lady working informed me they didn't have the jacket. After about 30 minutes of describing the jacket, she calls what appears to be the owner. Then they DENY that I ever dropped off the jacket!!! I was furious!!!! I showed her my 2 claim receipts. She refused to acknowledge anything I had to say. I told her I was not leaving until they found my jacket! She started threatening me starting they had video cameras. This place is absolutely horrible! Worst experience of my life!!!!"
1,"Second time here.. Amazing sushi, amazing service and vibe! Of course it's pricey but when you stay at Luxor you get a 20 dollar off coupon! Sooooo worth it"
0,"The food's pretty bland. First time I went there, I asked for my curry to be \""Thai hot\"" (meaning make it like you're making it for someone Thai, not watered down for American palettes). There was no heat.\n\nNext time I went, I told the waitress that last time I ordered, I said \""Thai hot\"" and got bland. She seemed surprised and well, maybe the last waiter just didn't hear me? Ok, so, just in case the last waiter didn't hear me and they actually do know how to do something other than bland, I told her an 8 out of 10 on the spice scale. Yeah, no. I poured in some chili powder and ate it. \n\nI usually order medium spice at my local Thai place in Maryland. Nicky's hottest setting is like eating ramen noodles by comparison.\n\nIf this is the best Thai food in Pittsburgh, I'm really glad I don't live in this city anymore, because clearly Pittsburgh doesn't know Thai."
0,"Got a chicken sandwich which was supposed to be breaded, it was not. The bun was 4 times the size of the chicken. Sweet potato chips were chewy. Probably should've tried a burger, but I wouldn't go back."
1,"Amazing! Incredible treehouse setting, stupendous service and great food. Las Vegas has a new jewel high atop the rather dull Crystals shopping center at the dreary City Center. I can't tell you how wonderful the entire experience dining at Mastro's is--it's magical. Go, enjoy and bring your camera and appetite."
0,We came in on a Sunday night with two table taken in the place and were asked to move to a smaller table in case a larger table came in. They are closing in 25 minutes and we wanted to watch the football game. I said we would move if a larger party came in and got attitude from our waitress.\nI would think they would want the extra income before closing. We live in the neighborhood and are in the industry. Dirty looks and attitude don't work for us.
0,"I HATE Blue Wasabi. I had the WORST experience here. You couldn't pay me to consume that repulsive crap they call \""Sushi\"". \nQuick summary of my experience.... My boyfriend and I went on a date. We sat on the patio. It took FOREVER to get our food. Granted it was kinda busy, we only ordered 2 rolls & some edamame. It shouldn't take an hour & a half. The waiter offered no apologies or explanation. The rice was sooo stale & dry. Sushi looked like it had been sitting out for an hour. We couldn't even choke it down. It was horrible, no joke. \nThen some poor girls purse was stolen right from the patio. Some dickhead drove up to the patio, his friend jumped out & snatched this womans purse who was dining on the patio. \nIt was a horrible experience. Blue Wasabi SUCKS!"
0,"Good cleaning, but way overpriced! I tried to negotiate a deal with the owner for regular dry cleaning (I clean about 40 pieces/month) and was shot down. Her excuse: We pay way too much for coupons and advertising. OK... I asked for the coupon price on the 20 pieces I had there and was refuted once again. Goodbye $120/month steady business???"
1,"I have tried a few different classes & have really liked all of them. The instructors are great and very kind. The classes/workouts are fun, and intense. The location makes for really easy access. They also sell really cute workout clothes (both their own brand and Lulu Lemon).  I would recommend it for sure- I love it."
1,i dig this place.  i love just tearing up the pizza like they do in italy.  the pizza was great...not at all greasy.  the servers are quick with the refills too.  \n\ni went there with a friend and the atmosphere seemed kind of dead though.  it's nice and clean...but i feel like they need to liven it up a bit.
0,"Came here for a sponsored event that included open bar and some free food.\n\nThere were only two servers at the one food station which caused the food line to be incredibly long.  The food options were also pretty limited (not sure if it was due to the sponsorship).  At one point of the night, the top bar had run out of Dos Equis, without a sign they were going to replenish.  \n\nThe atmosphere and amenities are geared towards a younger crowd - unfinished wood tables and chairs.\n\nThough the service a bit off, everyone was very nice."
0,"Had a perfect weekend in Sedona and was finishing it up at the talking stick. My overall experience of the resort was great with the exception of the spa. The customer service, attitude and communication of the spa staff was very poor. My main complaint is Terry the spa manager. Her management skills need some work as her communication style was combative and lacked balance. Unfortunaltley the spa staff are a bit snooty and lack good quality customer service skills. Would love to see the resort get some people I'm there who know how to provide good service!"
0,"I have been to this location a number of times. Each time, the service has not been great. We have waited too long for menus, drinks, and for our order to be taken. We were given our food and still had no silverware. Three separate people in our party asked for silverware at different times. We still never received it and had to walk up to the hostess to get some on our own so we could eat our food! The food and drinks are pretty good but I will never return to this location due to the poor service."
1,"What can you say, you can't beat the $10 month to month membership.  It does not have everything you would find in a full service gym but for the cost it is an excellent value.  There are three things I wish they had but won't complain; steam room, sauna and a rower machine.  Like all gyms you will find free weights, weight machines, tons of cardio machines with TV's and iPod connectors.  You will always find a cardio machine during peak times but will not find any classes or daycare but again for the price no biggie."
0,"As the saying goes about beer and kids.  Just cause you can make them doesn't mean you should.  The IPA tastes like mildly sweet water, fish and chips were mediocre.  The best item I had was the tap water with ice.  Yummy.  \n\nPlease do not ruin the three little beautiful letters, IPA by labeling your beer with them.  \n\nI'll bypass this place next time and go to Cinnabon."
1,"Here's a tip: check the ASU game schedule if you're making reservations during football season!  Something I neglected to do, and we ended up being stuck in game traffic, re-routed around a bunch closed streets, and arriving 30 minutes late for our reservation only to have nowhere to park.  Luckily, there was an empty spot in the lot behind the restaurant, and they were still able to accommodate our reservation, so it all worked out in the end.\n\nWe chose this place because we wanted a fancy restaurant that wasn't a steakhouse or seafood place.  House of Tricks delivered.  Food was amazing.  Atmosphere is intimate and just what the husband and I were hoping for on our date night.  \n\nAlthough we'd been here to eat before, it was 6 or 7 years ago so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I will say that I enjoyed the outside ambiance of this visit much more than I did the inside ambiance I remember from the first visit.  It's just so pretty on the outdoor patio, especially in the evening when the weather is nice.  And despite the tree we sat under that kept dropping its giant flowers on me!  Just as we were finishing our meal, a large party was seated on the patio next to us, and I was immensely grateful that we were almost done, because they were very loud, drunk, and obnoxious.  One of the other hazards of eating there on game night!\n\nWe'll definitely be back.  Just not on game night!"
1,Food was soo yummy!!! Will be back to try those yummy looking cronuts.\n\nThe dirty chips were amaze balls. I'm going to be coming in to try the French toast very soon.
0,"Heard the hype, d\u00e9cor was pretty cool.  Contemporary and dark.  I was sad to walk in and feel a little left out of what was a cool crowd and your not welcome vibe.  Served a drink and waited about five minutes and after I asked for another round. \n\nI will go back and assume this is not their typical service.\n\nFingers crossed for next time, especially since this is in my neighborhood."
1,"Yelp needs a 10 star option for this place. I LOVE MIKKI!! Every time we come she is wonderful! The food is amazing.  The Kai Pik Pao, spring rolls and a Thai iced tea is my usual and I have never been disappointed."
0,"We were staying at the Sanctuary for our anniversary weekend. Elements came highly recommended, but we had a lot of restaurants that we wanted to try, so had to go to Elements for lunch. The restaurant is beautiful with a fabulous view of the Valley. We had a window seat to take advantage of the view. Our server was prompt, friendly and attentive. \n\nThe food was unfortunately a huge disappointment. We started with the grilled pear and brie quesadilla. The pears were not grilled (were barely even cooked). The brie was good, but the overall combination lacked much flavor or pizazz. The honey and pine nut garnish were the only real source of flavor and made it tolerable. \n\nWe shared the \""specialty\"" Asian grilled chicken breast with grilled corn and cilantro slaw and the Angus burger with cheddar and balsamic roasted onions w/potato chips. The chicken specialty was an unseasoned cooked chicken breast with cold barbeque sauce poured on top and then cut into slices. I can't even remember having such a bland, uninspiring chicken dish. Trader Joe's frozen teriyaki chicken breasts are far superior. The grilled corn was actually grilled and was sweet and delicious. The cilantro slaw was some cabbage with shredded carrots and a few springs of cilantro, but no dressing or seasoning to bring it together. \n\nThe Angus burger was a good burger. Balsamic roasted onions were delicious. Potato chips were not anything special. \n\nWe also had breakfast from Elements via room service. Another disappointment. Average scrambled eggs. Fruit plate with limp, unripe cantaloupe and honeydew. Good latte. \n\nOverall, I am glad that we chose to go elsewhere for our anniversary dinner. We may go back to the Sanctuary, but not to Elements."
0,Fletcher's is a joke.... I went there for and oil change and they convinced me to buy 2 get one free. So my total out the door was $40. Well making this next appointment was the worst!!!!! I called everyday at 8am for there stupid same day app. crap and somehow they were already booked for the WHOLE day or didn't answer. I went in to get the refund for my other one I purchase and they would only give me 8$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When I should have gotten $20. The guy gave me so much attitude when I said fine I'll take the eight buck. But I have obviously can't get any help from them so it's 8$ or nothing! They also did nothing to try and accommodate the annoying situation they put me in .
1,"Right down the street from Arepas, is desert! Best place, oldest place. I want some, now. This blows Sonic, Cold Stone, BB, and Dairy Queen. Even better than a Frosty. I get mint chip, but I need to try everything. Super yum."
1,"I go here every Wednesday with a group of friends. Great food, good customer service."
1,"I'm not a mani/pedi person. I went with my aunt who got a pedi. My manicure has not chipped yet in four days. The prices were reasonable, everything including tools are clean. Lots of polish to choose from and they don't look old or gloopy.  The gentleman who took care of me turned up the football game for me to watch and shared a nice conversation with me. The only thing I didn't like was the cuticle cutter wasn't as sharp as I'd like and pulled on my skin a bit instead of cutting. I'd go def back."
1,"I stopped in here while visiting Las Vegas last week.  It has a unique decor, very much like a nice men's club, with lots of wood paneling and comfortable chairs.  There is lots of room to lounge upfront and then they take you to a smaller, but still very nice area in the back for the cut & shave.  Everyone in the place was extremely friendly.  Then, most importantly, they did an excellent job on both the shave & haircut.  It is a bit pricey for a 'barbershop', but certainly not unreasonable for the service they provide."
0,"Prices at mad pita are pretty cool, the service is great, there's fishes floating around in vases on the table...\n\nAnd...my gyro meat wasn't roasted and carved off the spit how I like it :(\n\nGyro meat is in strips and fried on a skillet top; not how I prefer. The lettuce and veggies were fresh, the tzatziki sauce was yummy as was the feta, but the meat and boring pita killed my gyro experience. Boyfriend got the falafel, he said it was yummy, overall more satisfying than my meal (as usual).\n\nNot sure if we will head back for round 2...I need my satisfying gyro fix! \nI ordered the baklava for dessert, it was a little different than the traditional Greek style I have had before. Really buttery but otherwise a little bland."
0,"This place is your typical Chinese fast food. I didn't find them friendly at all. I ordered the shrimp chow funn. I asked for no brown sauce, and it came with brown sauce. The portion were chincy for something that cost $8. It tasted okay, nothing special.  I haven't been back since.\n\nChina A GoGo is a NO NO."
0,"We came here for a quick dinner before heading out for the night. Since we were staying at the Venetian, we decided to just keep it simple and eat close by. Luckily, there was not a long wait for a party of 6.\n\nLet me just put it out now. RUDE SERVICE!\nI don't care if it's Vegas or not vegas, if you're a server, you should have a good attitude no matter what restaurant or location you're at. Our server, I shall leave his name out of this review, was rude the moment he came to our table and asked for drinks. We had already been drinking all day at the pool and all we wanted were waters. He gave us this look of disgust and made a comment along the lines of just waters?... And just kind of walked away to let us look over the menus. It would have been nice too to introduce yourself too, sir.\n\nFinally when he came back to take our orders, I asked him if they put the ranch on the side or on the Buffalo Wings appetizer dish and he looked at me as if I were asking a stupid question. His reply was \""So you want it on the side...? Or just extra on the side...?\"" I then had to explain to him to leave the ranch on the side because I was allergic to dairy and eggs. He then straight up said \""Well then you can't have them!! It has all of those in it\"" in a tone of voice assuming I'm supposed to know this?! Forget it then. We ended up ordering the Chicken Lettuce Wraps for an appetizer and when it came to entrees, I ordered the Clams with Pasta dish. I asked him what kind of noodles they used and he said, \""Egg noodles. You can't have that either!\"" I asked if they could substitute the noodles for non-egg noodles and he started listing off random noodles I barely recognized by name. I guess I had a confused look on my face because he just sighed and asked if I just wanted rice noodles instead. Done. Oh, and by the way, throughout this whole conversation over food allergies, this guy has the nerve to laugh and joke about it....\n\nFood comes out, he doesn't even come back to check on us until after we're almost done and it's only to ask if we wanted boxes. Honestly, this place is open 24/7 and I know for sure I would come back here after a night of drinking, but if all the servers here had this guys attitude, I would rather go to Denny's. Looking at the other reviews, it seemed like our table just got bad luck and got this horrible server. Overall, the food is pretty good with big portions. I would probably compare this place to a Cheesecake Factory with a Maggiano's ambiance."
0,"There are many wonderful things about Marty's- unfortunately service isn't one of them. The food is great for the most part ...and I love the design of the cafe. I really want this place to make it. But the staff could be much more attentive and friendly. We called at 10 am to place a lunch order for 6 people and asked for it to be ready at 11:45. We arrived to pick up at 11:50 and were met with clueless stares. I said \""are you sure you don't have this order?\"" and because it wasn't on the iPad they said no we don't have it. So we spent almost 10 minutes scrambling to call and text people to get their orders so we could re-order. Then I was able to confirm that indeed the order was placed through a specific employee and I shared his name. Only then did the girl at the counter check with her co workers. Moments later she comes back to say \""we do have the order. But it's not ready.\"" (mind you after we already re-ordered). Last straw is that they packed the food and it sat there for 5 minutes until I asked the guy \""is that our food?\"" to which he replied \""I don't know, is it?\"" - totally lame rude and unacceptable for a place with these prices and trying to be upscale. Total fail Marty's because there was no apology or attempt to say we sorry screwed this order up. Just plain bad service and very disappointing."
0,"Pizza was cold food took a long while.....then had to hunt down a server to get utensils .... I recommend not coming here... Our server was Alison was very lazy to check in on us while we waited a long time to get our order and had to hunt her down to tell her the pizza was cold .... However , another server on the other side of the room Summer was helpful to fill our glasses of water and was a very attentive to her patrons. I do not recommend coming here and redirect you to mc Donald's instead."
0,"greatly pains me to do this, but this one star review is not tied to the food, but the lady that brings the coffee and water...she sat a coffee cup in front of me that was obviously used...it had the sip strip down the side, and drips else where...I called her back and said the cup was dirty..she told me that it wasn't dirty, that she must have bumped it while carrying it to the table...felt the cup, and the coffee stains were definitely dry...called her back again, and she asked if I would like a new cup...YA THINK! ..wow, that really fried me that she would even bring it in the first place, then try and lie her way out of replacing it...imagine the bacteria that could be on that cup, left by the former drinker....other than that the food was good as always, but this is a health hazard, and hope that management staff will cover this important issue with their coffee servers...."
0,"Kind of on the fence about this place....\n\nI like the atmosphere, and their beer is cold and well served...\n\nBut the service is not always good.  I've found that the wait for them to take your credit card here is insanely long.\n\nAlso I've tried their food, which I describe as okay.\nThe pizza bites were fine, but they're something I could whip up in 10 minutes at home.\nTheir wings are okay, but aren't quite as crisp as I'd like.  I understand that they're marinated and baked, but perhaps baking them a bit longer or flipping them more often would lead to a more uniform-crispness.  My order was soggy in several places."
1,"My girlfriend and I have been Shogun fans for a few years and when we can, we'll take in a few of the monster-sized rolls, some edamame and Saki and call it a night.\n\nToday I went for the lunch special and was very pleased with the portions and the price.  The Katsu chicken was crisp and not over cooked and the roll was right on target. \n\nWe usually feel like we've been well fed, well served and reasonably priced.  The fish is alway fresh, the sushi chefs always accommodating to create a special version of a standard roll and the wait staff kept our glasses filled.\n\nI read some of the other reviews and feel that over the long run, some are off base - this is my perspective from over more than a few years of being a semi-regular dinner."
0,"We went there at 1:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon and the service was AWFUL!!  We ordered the Italian salad and a pizza. It took them 50 minutes to get our food out to us!   There were people who ordered after us who were getting their lunch.  The place was not busy.  I finally asked if they had lost our ticket, the server was very rude and just said we had a sudden rush.  What?  There were 4 tables outside with people and at the most 5 inside!  I ordered my dressing on the side and of course it came saturated with it along with wilted lettuce!  The pizza was just ok, nothing spectacular.  If you want a GREAT salad and pizza, drive 5 minutes south to Oregano's.  I was very disappointed because the atmosphere was so modern and great!  So, in a nut shell!  The atmosphere is GREAT, the service is lousy and the food is not even \""ok\"". My guess is with all of the places that have great service and excellent food that this place will not be around much longer.  Not even in the same realm as Postino's or LG Orange."
0,"I absolutley hate this place.  Filthy, overpriced, and smells like a mix of ass and sweat.  The cover is about $30, then there's a two drink minimum.  Each watered down drink is like $15.  This review is for upstairs, the penis floor.\n\nBring lots of money if you want the guys to be nice to you.  You have been warned!  If a guy starts dancing on you and you tell him to get off and refuse to pay him (hey, no one asked his scrawny ass to come over to us), they cop a MAJOR attitude.  Then that one stripper you that you told to get the hell off of you goes and tells everyone else that your a cheap bitch and to not go anywhere near you and your crew.  At this point, party's over.\n\nThis an absolutley true story, it happened a few years ago at my girl's bachelorette party.  I'm going to a bachelorette party in Vegas this weekend, and guess where the bride-to-be wants to go... OG.  I'm so pissed..."
0,"Friendly staff! But... The cookies, cakes, etc were not only overrated, but not even yummy. I got a couple cookies and they were all rock hard. Seriously, a cookie from a famous bakery?! Don't get me wrong, I love Cake Boss and was excited to go, but I was totally disappointed with even the basic baked goods."
1,"Happened upon TMK due to my anger with another mechanic... drove home from the other place on a Saturday (after most places were closed) and emailed a few other mechanics. Whichever one called first on Monday would get my business. Noticed TMK has rave reviews on here, and a friend sent me their info in a text stating they service her car and she loves them. Now I wished I'd only emailed them... flash forward to Monday. One place calls to let me know they don't service Honda's, and that's it. Hmmm.... call TMK on my way to work and ask if they work on Honda's (maybe that's why they didn't call). The guy that answered was super short, said they do and asked if I had emailed them because they had me on the books for the day. I tell him I called because no one had called in response to my email and he stated maybe they got busy. NOT a good start, but I need a 2nd opinion on my car and they already had me on the books...\n\nI tell him I need a compressor and he states not necessarily, maybe I just need coolant, he'll evaluate the car and let me know. OK, I'm certainly no mechanic, I just know AC is necessary in AZ and I don't want to go even a day without it (plus, I just had coolant added and my cool air went to hot instead). I drop my car off on the way to work and the lady who checked my car in was super nice, I felt better from the start. I get to work and check my email, and feel 100% better. Instead of calling, they replied to my email as soon as they opened that morning they would be happy to see my car Monday and would get to the bottom of my AC issue. Mystery solved on why I didn't hear from them.  \n\nVERY long story short (see my other review for the longer version)- the previous mechanic who had my car added coolant, then sent my car home with a bigger problem than when I brought it in- blowing hot air and the compressor fighting to turn on and off repeatedly. He told me I needed a new compressor and he would do it for $1200. TMK calls to tell me the only issue wrong with my car is too much coolant was added which would trigger my compressor to act up.  There was no leak, no compressor issue, nothing. They fixed the coolant and my car was perfectly fine. The other place would have put a new compressor kit in my car for $1200 without a 2nd thought. I was ready and willing to pay TMK to do the same just so I would have AC and so the other mechanic wouldn't have my business. TMK charged me $85 to fix the issue and saved me over $1100. TMK was friendly and honest and will have my business, as well as my husbands, from here on out."

0,"We are fans of novel cocktails and new mixology and stopped in to try some of their drinks. We arrived and the atmosphere was fun, comfortable seats. We ordered two cherry limeade martinis looking forward to a refreshing beverage. What was sent out though was two highball glasses filled with ice and lime juice and soda. There wasn't even a cherry flavor. Usually martinis are served up unless asked for otherwise and are a stronger beverage because they are 10 oz. rather than 6 or 8 of other drinks. We left unsatisfied and with a $36 bill including tip."
0,"Worst service ever since they changed to electronic ordering!! I was 5 minutes away and wanted to place an order to go over the phone so I called in, much to my surprise they have a new phone ordering system where I was directed to some call-center who knows where. I was then told I would need a credit card to place an order, understandable if I was ordering lunch from my office or at home but in this case I was in the car driving so I do not have access to my credit card. I was told I would have to place the order in the store, as I arrived there were 20 people in line some trying to figure out how to use the electronic ordering system. I figured it would be easy so I tried, swiped my credit card, and I was told I placed the order incorrectly and was told I would have to place it again. not only was I in a rush at that point I would have to speak to a manager to get the credit from the first order that I placed incorrectly. Then someone tried to explain it to me, i didn't want a lesson, i wanted her to correctly take my order. So they're \""efficient \""electronic ordering system has delayed me getting to work By 30 minutes, I left with the incorrect order so that I did not have to place another order and wait to be refunded. What a headache and what poor customer service. They offered me a complimentary drink for my hassle, I just laughed and left. What I really wanted was my correct order, and the computer/iPad isn't going to do it. Save yourself some time in the morning and stick with good old fashion Starbucks or local places like Rocky River Coffee, where they know that customer service is done face to face and will make a true effort in making your order right."
0,"This place was ok. The decor is nice and the ladies lounge is super cute! \n\nThe only thing I would like to tell everyone is to pay attention to how much the bartenders charge you and how much change they give you back!\n\nThere is more than one bar. I went to the main bar and got Coconut Ciroc on the rocks and it was 14 dollars. I went to one of the smaller bars and ordered the same thing and I was charged 19 dollars.  \n\nAlso, at the main bar, rather than give my friends all thier change and let them decide what to tip the bartender, he attempted to take his own tip out and give them the rest after he took his tip! This was crazy. I am not sure it was just a bad night. \n\nOther than that I was there on a Saturday, the music was good and the crowd was okay. If you are not into the big clubs this place is okay not too big and not too small and you still get the club experience."
0,"This bar only gets 1 star because giving 0 stars is not an option. This place is run by incompetent, deceitful managers who hire incompetent, untrustworthy employees. The first and only time I went here I was overcharged and then lied to by the management. \n   I had gone out with two friends for drinks. I charged our drinks to my card for a total of $18. I tipped in cash ( I've worked in the industry and know how much cash tips are appreciated) and drew a line through the tip line, wrote $18 for the total, and signed the receipt. A few days later I checked my bank statement, my card had been charged for $100. So I visited the Ivory Room to speak with someone about this gross overcharge. When I showed up, I asked to speak with a manager to which the employee responded that there was none present. I told him I had been overcharged and needed to correct it, explained my situation and then the bartender responded by saying, I was the one who waited on you, you meant to tip me $82 and close your tab for $100. I argued with him saying that was ridiculous and not what happened to which he responded, \""Oh, well maybe you were drunk\"". Unbelievable, not only that he would say that, but I had one drink. He told me I could speak with the manager next door, but she would not be there until the next day.\n   The next day I went next door and asked to speak with the manager, a woman came out and asked me what I was there for. I explained the situation and she responded, \""Oh, he (the bartender) told me you'd be coming. I looked at the receipt and you wrote in a tip for $84\"". First off, that isn't even the right amount, and second, she was obviously blatantly lying to me. I told her that I wished to see the receipt and she told me she could not get it at the moment but if I came back the next day she would have a COPY for me. behind the bar but may not be present. I was too frustrated to refute and came back the next day.\n   The next day, I came back yet again, asked for the copy, and the manager comes out. She said that she \""went back\"" to look at the receipt and I was indeed correct, I had written a line through the tip line and written $18 on the total. Making it very obvious that she had LIED to me the day before. She said she was going to refund my entire $100 (as she should) and if it \""made me feel better\"" she would \""really scold\"" the employee who did this (it didn't). \n   I had every intention of getting this employee fired, for very obviously thinking he could take advantage of me because he thought I was drunk or wouldn't check my bank statement. \n  Bottom line: This place is run by incompetent, deceitful people. The manager I spoke with is also the owner. If that doesn't say something about the standards of service, I'm not sure what does."
1,"Where do I begin? I love Casey Moore's!\n\nWhat a great ambiance! The outside patio is where it's at, with tons of seating and misters. Lots of beautiful decorations to stare at while you're waiting for friends to arrive, and the staff as well as fellow patrons are always very friendly.\n\nWhen I feel like getting in touch with my hippie side I go to Casey Moores, because I can always expect to find someone outside painting a work of art, or photographing the wandering cats (yes, they have cats! they're well-fed and happy). \n\nIt gets pretty busy after 5pm, but the good news is that if you arrive before 5 you can bring your pets and stay all night. I bring my dog in all the time, and she is always met with animal lovers who didn't know they could bring their pets.. so now you know!\n\nThe oysters are good, but if you're eating them out on the patio the heat kind of kills that deal for you. I had never tried oysters before going to Casey's but they are surprisingly tasty and comparatively better than other oyster houses.\n\nIf you're feeling pretty ballsy, go pee on the Blarney Stone! Every time I go there I wish I was a man so I could do it."
0,"Okay, maybe Del Taco is not what I remember it being when I was when I lived off of it in LA, but overall this food court is terrifying.  It feels like your ship has dropped anchor in a Disney Pirates Of The Caribbean ride port. \nThe guy that walks around with the parrot on his shoulder was even there.\nThe woman behind us, at 11:30 on a Thursday night, had her 5 week old baby with her, that was about the quality of the food, facilities and people all around."

1,"Great familiy owned middle eastern restaurant.  The food is great, serivce is fantastic, and everyone is very friendly."
1,"Sometimes I just like to go out, drink, dance and interact with strangers all while getting my ear drums assaulted by what can only be described as nasty bass drops. Yes, sometimes I like to go to clubs. And TAO group has almost never failed me in my clubgoing experiences and Marquee was no different.\n\nThe first time I went was a brief walk through essentially-went with a friend who does not handle enclosed crowded spaces well. Yeah. I know. So after a quick walk through we left and I figured I'd never be back because while nothing displeased me at the club, I really only go if I'm guaranteed seating and a place to hide the heels that I've kicked off.\n\nNearly a year later, came back for my best friend's birthday and she had a table (bingo!), so I got to stay, play and experience. I honestly don't know where we were in the club, just at a table, near one of the bars, but we could see a lot of the dance floor action and had a decent view of the DJ's stage. What I liked about Marquee mostly had to do with service. Typically, when you get a comp'd table, particularly with all girls, service is pretty subpar (there are other words I could use...) because the busser and hostess make an unfortunate assumption that a table of girls is not going to tip well. Our hostess did not do that-she was SO nice, came back to check on us frequently and didn't treat us like second class citizens. Even if she didn't want to be bothered with us, she never showed it. So we left her a FAT tip. It's very simple: don't be a bitch, and we'll leave a good tip.\n\nThe music was great, the DJ was fun and someone threw a whole bunch of dollar bills onto the dance floor-so all in all a great experience.  Not sure I would come back without a table because of personal preference, but would recommend Marquee for an authentic Vegas nightclub experience."
0,"I typically don't write bad reviews about places unless they reAlly did something to upset me. Koi pretended that it was $20 for open bar . We had one man with us and he got kicked out when he tried to order a drink past midnight. \n\nThis place is horrible and they will make a scene about what they offer you outside the  \""club\"". I put the word club in parenthesis because this place calls themselves a club but its far from it."

0,"The absolute worst hotel experience I've had in my life! Really there is so much to complain about I could write a book. Where to begin? Well, checking in at 11pm on Thursday night was going to take 3-4 hours, so I didn't even get to see my room until 4:30 in the morning. I refused to just stand in the humungous line of over 300 people, so instead I went sight seeing with friends who were staying at a normal hotel across the street. Guess this is what I get for being cheap! Although the rooms were really inexpensive, I would have paid to leave this place. \n\nMy other big complaint was their parking garage. It is a giant nonsensical mess of pillars, with no signs directing which way to go. Cars weave every which way, some going the wrong way and almost causing head on collisions. It took me almost half an hour just to cross Las Vegas Blvd to get to the garage portion. Then I had to follow a huge maze, dodging pillars and pedestrians, before finally finding parking. \n\nOnce I FINALLY got to my room at 4am, I found that it was decent. It was up on a higher level with a partial strip view, and I think the carpeting was new. The bed was very comfortable, and the room had a small balcony. They upgraded me to this \""VIP\"" room after losing my original reservation. Thank god, because if this was for VIPs, I can't even imagine what a regular room would've looked like! It was very basic, but at least clean. That's more than I can say for the rest of this casino. \n\nAt the lobby, gift shop areas, and check in desk, the carpeting was absolutely filthy. The entire property stunk of rancid cigarette smoke, as did the clientele. Everyone walking around in the place looked like bums or out of work hookers. There were a few average joes like me roaming around, who looked absolutely horrified at their surroundings. \n\nChecking out was another fiasco. Their easy checkout on the TV wasn't working, and the phone system to reach someone at the front desk takes about as long as checking in, so I finally resorted to waiting in line downstairs. This hotel equaled a whole lot of stinky waiting to go nowhere. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you are flat broke and can't afford anything else. To pseudo-quote The Hangover... \""holla...hotel of squalor\""."
0,"Stayed here for Mr. Olympia 9/15 - 9/18.  \n\nRoom is dated but roomy.  Elevators are slow and packed.  Arena seating is almost ridiculously uncomfortable.  Made me question why they didn't sell seat cushions...ouch.\n\nNice selection of restaurants.  The breakfast buffet omelets were nice.\n\nBut the lasting memory I will have is the complete lack of customer service and if I could give negative points, I would.  After the first night here, we started counting the cocktail waitresses, bartenders, and hotel staff with incredibly hostile attitudes.  But then we lost count.  I have to mention that there was one bartender who was amazing and who didn't have some sort of negative retort for the people he served.  I'm curious; what rationale is there for management to allow snarky behavior?\n\nOur work has customer service elements and we understand how rude or entitled some patrons can be.  Which is why we go out of our way to be nice and appreciative.  I was appalled at the attitudes and the level of entitlement of the staff at a fairly emply hotel (save for the retirees and conference attendants) this far off the strip.\n\nPs.  Busing is abysmal.\n\nPps.  Thank god for the movie theater.\n\nI could cope with bad parking, a lack of pillows in the rooms, a toilet that didn't work, loud A/c, waking up to a domestic incident in the hallway...but attitude (and sarcastic retorts) when ordering a beer or asking a simple question at the front desk?  Really?"
0,The only thing super about this Super Wal-Mart is the length of their lines.  They are always super long!  I wish this place had self check out that would make things sooooo much easier.  I stop by here on my way to work sometimes to pick something up to eat for lunch later.  I tried to do that yesterday and only 2 registers were open and there was at least 5 people w/full shopping carts in line.  The line kept growing and growing and growing and growing.  A junkies dream come true.  I had to make a choice of being late for my job I dislike or being on time and arriving empty handed.  I didn't wanna be late so I left.  Before I left a black lady was getting irritated and yelled about the lines being long.\n\nThe second to last time I was here a new line had just opened up and I had to power walk to it quickly and sneakily cut in front of an old couple so I could get out of here in a timely manner.  This place is a retail warzone.  Not really but the lines annoy me.
1,"I came here at the last day of 2013. Ar first, my friends and I wanna go to Caesar but they charged a lot and had a limited two hours dining time. We felt not very happy and the see the review of wicked spoon and quickly decided to give it a try. We are so satisfied with every meal they offer, I love the truffle risotto so much and had it twice! The desserts are awesome! This is my first time spotting the strawberries with chocolate in buffet. The service was also good, waiters are all polite and kind to answer our questions. I will come next time if I go to vegas!"
0,"Dear Claim Jumper,\nI did not want offer a rating to you at this time however it is a requirement so I am giving you an \""Eek! Methinks not\"" as I was unable to get past the order portion of our dining experience and had to vacate your premises.  Let me just say that I have enjoyed your establishment for quite some time.  As a very picky eater it is a difficult world out there dining wise so when my husband says.  \""Let's go to Claim Jumpers\"" a sparkle appears in my eye.  That sparkle is now gone.  I have noticed recent changes to your establishment menu wise but I could always rely on my Chicken & Biscuits meal to bring a smile to my face and satisfaction to my taste buds.  Imagine if you will your grandmother telling you she is no longer making her famous meatballs or McDonalds saying they no longer are serving Big Macs.. that is how I felt when our server advised me you are no longer offering the Chicken & Biscuits meal.  I realize it was an \""off the menu\"" item but how can the delicious golden brown flaky chicken and warm melt in your mouth biscuits get their fair chance at a coveted menu spot when they are not promoted.  I am therefore petitioning that Chicken & Biscuits officially replace Meatloaf and Mashed Potatoes under the \""Favorites\"" portion of your menu.  Oh jeez I forgot to mention the best part.. the Chicken & Biscuits also comes with mashed potatoes and gravy.  Unless you are in a nursing home who eats meatloaf at a restaurant anymore?  Please I am asking as a Yelp newbie that the community unite.  Together we can make a difference.  Until then I can no longer call Claim Jumpers my restaurant friend."
0,"My husband and I visited Ra for happy hour. Upon looking at their happy hour menu, I thought it looked great. Lots of food and drink variety for decent prices. \n\nThe blushing geisha cocktail was delicious and my husband enjoyed his Kirin. Unfortunately, the whole eating experience was underwhelming. \n\nThe Pacific Roll has potential. It tastes great, but it was very loosely rolled. Every bite fell apart either before we dipped it into the soy or in mid-dip. We had a lot of soy splashes on our table. \n\nThe asparagus salmon and spicy shrimp were both as bland as could be and chock full of minced stuff. Save the minced fish for off-brand fish sticks, people, please. We also ordered the seared tuna and the citrus yellowtail tapas. Both were just thin cut fillets of rawish fish with some foliage and sauce drizzle thrown on top. Meh.\n\nLastly, we sat on the patio, which is a back patio. It faces an alleyway rather than Mill Ave. And while it has a nice outdoor bar, it was chock full of smokers.  I'm a non-smoker so I'm biased on this point, yes, but who smokes while eating sushi? Also, there is no air circulation back there. Just patio and alleyway, so all the smoke just hangs.\n\nI will give props to our server. She was prompt, polite, and delivered our order speedily. The speedy part was great because with all that smoke, we were dying to get out of there."
0,"I agree with Don J. We ate there this week, and had the barbeque burger (with a split fee), and there was nothing special about the burger at all. Our wait staff was attentive, though one of the staff members had BO which was noticeable standing beside our table. \nThe onion rings were good, but there just isn't anything that would compel us to go back."
1,"My favorite Indian restaurant (Gaylord) is now out of business and other Indian restaurants I've been to have been mediocre which is why I'm so glad I gave Mount Everest a try eventhough the place was kind of creepy.  The quality of the food is comparable to Gaylord's but you get more food and pay a lot less.  The people that work here are very nice and friendly.  They have Bollywood videos on at all times.\n\nThey give you a basket of papadum with mint and tamarind sauces.  We started of with samosa (they're like potato-filled empanadas with ginger and spices) and aloo tikki (fried patties of mashed potatoes in chick pea batter).\n\nMango Lasi:\nCreamy mango shake. 5/5\n\nVeggie Samosa:\nYou get two pieces for $4.  The crust was the right thickness and wasn't too doughy.  You can definitely taste the spices.  I had to use the tamarind sauce to tone down the heat a bit. Very filling. 4/5\n\nAloo Tikki:\nYou get 2 patties for $4. Crispy deep-fried mashed potatoes.  Very filling as well.  Great flavor. 5/5\n\nPalak Paneer:\nI was looking for the cheese on top since that's what I'm used to.  4/5\n\nGarlic Naan:\nI love this stuff.  We had 2 orders. Hot, garlicky and buttery bread to scoop/dip saucy dishes with. 5/5\n\nChicken Tikka Masala:\nMy favorite Indian dish.  We ordered mild but it was still quite spicy...but it burned so good. 5/5\n\nKulfi:\nA mild cheesy ice cream and you can see pistachio bits. 4/5\n\nGulab Jamun:\nMy favorite Indian dessert. They're like hot cheese dougnuts in simple syrup. 5/5\n\nI honestly wasn't expecting the food to be that good.  This is my new favorite in Vegas!  They also have a lunch buffet from 11am-3pm for $10-11.  I'd come back here for that!"
1,"Surprisingly charming, MAG succeeds as an oasis amidst the tinsel town glitter. For a Vegas theme eatery, the interior is surprisingly classy and romantic, but the best seats as many have said are outside on the terrace overlooking the Bellagio water works. \n\nA supplemental gluten-free menu, which includes complementary g.f. bread with butter and (wonderful!) roasted olives, was most appreciated. The \""real\"" wheat bread comes in a paper bag, which seemed a little odd and out of sync with the otherwise chic vibe.\n\nStarter of a frisee salad was a little disappointing, with the greens seemingly undressed and couched on a puddle of water. The rustic country pate was a delight though, very flavorable and on request served with triangles of g.f. toast. The main meals of frites, and steaks, were tasty, though my dining partner's was somewhat chewy though mine was tender.\n\nService was very professional and very French. So if you're not a native Parisian or can't fake the accent, don't look for employment here."
0,"I was not impressed by La Cave at all. They had my favourite wine (Joh. Jos. Prum) which is = to a * on its own. but they only had it by the half bottle so that's loss of 1/2 *. The service was mediocre at best.  The food sounded like it was going to amazing and flavorful but most of it was very bland, the only exception being the beef carpacio which was amazing. \n\nFood\nAhi Tuna- tasteless\nThai Snapper Ceviche- bland\nAngus Mini burgers-  not enough sauce too much meat\nBeef Carpaccio- phenomenal\n\nrepeat- nope"
0,This McDonalds is one of the worst I have ever been to. There are always transients outside begging for money. Many of them approach you at your car or follow you out of the building. The food is decent but the line is always long. The staff has little common sense. They refuse to give you a drink cup after you have paid and make you wait until your food is ready. This is especially inconvenient because of the terrible drink station layout with no where to put your food. Also don't bother asking for a free cup of water. They give you a cup which is smaller than what you get in a kids meal. Avoid this McDonald's at every opportunity!
1,This place is really good! I came here for the first time and got an iced coffee and their BLTAA. The coffee was so good and the sandwich was amazing too! It came with a side of fresh roasted vegetables. I can't wait to try more things on the menu!
0,"HMMM NOT MUCH TO SAY HERE! The usual new \""hit\"" club. This place was gorgeous, hence the two stars, the people were ugly though. The music was horrible something like a jumble of mike jones and chingy? yeah sounds about right. Next time I will save $100 bucks on drinks and sleezy guys and take it over to an after hours house club instead,"
1,"I've always thought pretty highly of most of the Fox Restaurant Concepts, and Blanco is no exception.  Although I've never had very great service here (kind of slow and unattentive), everything I've had on the menu has been excellent and they have a longer-than-normal beer list, too.  The prices of everything are especially fair, considering the quality of food.\n\nI think Blanco is a particularly good spot for groups.  The atmosphere always seems to be buzzing, and they have large enough spaces to bring several tables together."
1,"Absolutely luv this place! Tina is my go-to manicurist & she's amazing! Never have I bleed from her doing my nails, always friendly & we talk the entire time! Lol I'm glad I found this place!!"
1,"Tout mignon comme caf\u00e9! Le look retro du caf\u00e9 m'a surpris un peu au d\u00e9part mais c'\u00e9tait le fun de se retrouver dans un endroit qui partage le zen d'un caf\u00e9 relax avec le fun d'un \""diner\"" retro.

0,"NOTE**\nThis review is only for the Pharmacy.\n\nBeen here to this pharmacy a couple of times because it's closer to my house when i needed it. I always get the same rude customer service with pharmacy technicians. One time i was here, my bf dropped his prescription for his eyes that needs to be taken non-stop daily. The pharmtechs told us to come back the next day after they call us.\nSo we actually received 3 calls from them telling us to come back and pick the medicines up.\nSo we came back the same day we received the calls only to find out that their pharmacy's computer system was down. And waited a good hour and it wasn't fixed still. We had to go because my bf has to work.\nWe went back the next day to finally pick it up at exactly 9am (pharmacy opens) and they were still closed. There was a long line waiting for them and they opened 10min after. Guess what?! It wasn't ready yet!! And then their bitchy pharmtech girl was staring at us with a WTF look and said \""well you gotta talk to the pharmacist, there's nothing we can do about it.\"" Well she needs to figure it out. She is totally LACKING customer service. It was early in the morning and she was trying to ruin it. What if i had a heart problem and i need my medication right away?! Gah. This place is giving us too much hassle. DEF NOT GOING BACK HERE, and i don't recommend it to people too."

0,"Okay, so I hate Beanscene, my friends hate Beanscene, my friends friends hate Beanscene, their friends hate Beanscene and the good people of Yelp have spoken and they don't seem to rate Beanscene much either. So why in the love of all things coffee related is it always so busy!? I just can't fathom it out. No matter what Beanscene you go to, they seem to have a constant of rude staff, luke warm coffee/hot chocolate and poor customer service.\n\nI've never had a good experience in Beanscene cafes, from the time someone spilt their coffee all over me, to the time I had to wait 25 minutes for my order, to the time I got asked for ID to buy a hot chocolate. So yeah, I'm not a fan but I felt I had to go into this Beanscene to be fair even though I felt nauseous just looking in the window at this coffee shop bursting to the rafters with punters. Still, I'll give it a chance, I thought to myself, and strolled inside.\n\nLike all other Beanscene's the dull brown decor is exactly the same, the trying too hard to be cool lounge music is exactly the same. I just went for a tea which was reasonably priced but pretty standard, the staff were the usual, unenthusiastic, can't-be-bothered with customers attitude. \n\nThis is quite a large Beanscene so there are quite a lot of seats but we still had to look around until we could find one and even then it still had all the remnants of the previous customers half drunk coffee. I drank me tea quite fast so we could leave and I left feeling as uninspired and as bitter towards Beanscene as I always am. After so many awful experiences with Beanscene out of principle, I really don't want to set foot in another one and instead always look for a nice small independent cafe. I don't feel too bad though because lets face it, Beanscene is lacking in a lot of things but one of those things isn't customers."
1,"I have been coming here at least two times every week now and Johnny has NEVER disappoint me. The food is always so good, fresh, fast and affordable. This is a must try place! :)"
0,"the rio is an overpriced waste of time and money! The 22 year old building is falling apart and all the ac vents are moldy and blow swamp cooler hot air. For $275 a night you can go anywhere else and be better off. The staff is rude and I consider this to be my worse Vegas decision ever (and there have been a ton of bad decisions haha). The voodoo club sucks, and seriously if you pop the cover off any vent they are covered in mold. Gross."
1,"Wow wow wow really great place. I threw my bf a surprise birthday party here...which at first I thought was a nice bar and grill but the morning of the party I drove 30 minutes here to drop off the cake....and was kinda shock to find that it was kinda like a dive bar. Usually I wouldn't pick places like that but since it was a party of 30, I wasn't going to change the place just because there's peanut shells all over the place. But really it turned out to be a great place that had a perfect area that sat all 30 of us. \n\nThe service was really wonderful...when I called in to make the reservation twice...since at first I thought it would only be a party of 10 but more people decided to come so it went up to 30, the guy that took the reservation was really nice about it, even asked me if I was bringing a cake. The waitress that served us was also pretty awesome.\n\nThe portions of the food was huge and cheap and oOoh the wings are a bomb and what was even better was for Tuesdays it's only $6.50 for a dozen of any flavor wings. \n\nOverall I am very satisfied and happy with this place and the party was a hit...although I think we were their biggest party there because if it wasn't for us I think the place would have been pretty dead....There weren't too many people there for dinner. \n\nAnyways I would happily come back here."
0,"It's inexpensive and has been updated but it has that \""lipstick on a pig\"" feeling. It still feels old and the whole place smells like cigarette smoke, meat, and Febreze. Pool has no appeal. The gym is a hodgepodge of mismatched cardio equipment. We won't stay here again."
0,I have never had an airline deny me when I make it to the gate 5 minutes before scheduled take off. US Airways lost my business for life. Worst airline ever!
1,Best sushi in The Phoenix area! Staff is always pretty nice and the quality is awesome. Have never had a roll I didn't like! I go there a few times a month! Highly recommend you try it out
1,"They shortened the happy hours at these bars, so happy hour is actually almost an actual hour now. More corporate greed at work. They did have a few beer specials, like 5 buck tall bud lights,  so that made it workable. Ordered the bikini wrap which was pretty good for a wrap. White chicken, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes and onions. Choice of wrap like spinach would have been nice. The fresh Cole slaw almost stole the show...The cook must have cut it up after I ordered. Best slaw in awhile. Good switch from fries. Not a bad location. Good living room area which I had all to my lonesome watching game."
0,"They try too hard IMO and haven't mastered the basics. Normally would give it 3 stars but given the price point I needed to pull it back a notch. Between the 3 of us we had the bone in NY strip, the stuffed chicken breast, and the prime rib daily special with the roasted potatoes, asparagus, and wasabi mashed potatoes that came with the prime rib as well as the table side-made caesar salad. Caesar was good but took a long time for the entrees to come. Prime rib was undercooked (asked for medium rare), strip average, and the ricotta in the chicken breast was cold. Server was nice but seemed overwhelmed/worked. Decor was very nice but lots of other choices out there at this price point."
1,the food was good and had very nice presentation.\nwe had: \nmezza combo\nsteak and hummus\nfried kebbeh\nmakanek\nfalafel\nmossaka\n\nits more expensive than what i thought it would be.
0,"Decided to give this place a try....First, let me say the bartenders could use a bit more personality.  With that said, we ordered a chicken cutlet sandwich and was told it was big enough for 2.  Well, yes it was, but was no larger than a large Subway.  the sauce was acidy and very spicy. Not hot spicy, but spicy.  SALTY as well.  The salad that came with it would have been much better with just a simple oil and vinegar dressing with pepper and salt.  The dressing was piled on it, making the lettuce soggy.  I think it was comprised of some sort of soured cream and lemon mixture. and SALT once again.  We each had one glass of wine and the bill was a staggering 46.00 with tip.  I could have gone to Russo's for a much better sandwich, for a lot less. Nope, won't be going back.  Too many other better places here in Vegas, on and off strip."

0,"DON'T DO IT! A friend of mine took my car here since he said he had a friend there so I figured it was worth a shot. Worse mistake of my life. I only wish I checked here BEFORE I let him take it there. Please, don't use them, I'm only trying to help you. These guys are rotten, like many have stated. Read the other reviews and believe them. They held my car hostage for $2300 which didn't even include any repair work. It was only supposed to be an estimate. Now it's in a thousand pieces, but at least I got it back. So buyer beware, unless you wanna lose your money (and your vehicle) don't use these guys."
1,"The Girls and I were in Vegas for a fun trip and stopped by here one early evening for a bite.  Food was REALLY yummy - we had nachos, mahi mahi tacos and Bacon Bleu burger (AMAZING).  Our waitress MINDY G was AWESOME!  So friendly and energetic!  She recommended we get a \""YOUNG B*TCH\"" for our fun drink and we were SO GLAD she did!!!  Would definitely go back!!  MINDY - YOU ROCK!!  :)"
1,"Very basic class to have a speeding ticket removed. 4.5 hours went by ssssssllllowwwlllllllllyyyyy! You'd have to be a cyclops to read this slow!\nAnyhow, there is no video and the animation is lame. \n\nAll of the end of each chapter are questions which made up the 2 finals: (1) 25 question version on content and another (20 Question test on environmentals--- like what logo did you see on the page. It's all multiple choice and it's hard not to get 100%. \n\nWould suggest doing this all at once as it obviates the need to recall or re-study the materials. \n\nThese guys did not ding me for extra fees of third party identification. I'm guessing these are gone.\n\nThe school did not notify me that my delay from the Tempe Court and ticket were received, so it does require at least one phone call. \n\nOne last note: Arizona has some weird laws and interesting trivia like \""dust storms travel SE to NW\"". I'm not sure this is actually true, but the McCain-ites believe it, and it was in the trafffic school, and on the net....so, it must be true! :-)"
0,"I don't understand why other people's reviews before the one I'm about to write had so many legitimate complaints, but still gave this place 4stars (too generous).  We went there for dinner a few nights ago and thought the service was a bit disjointed and the steaks were so so.  Service got off to a very slow start. After they finally brought over some bread, they forgot the butter/oil & vinegar.  By the time they came back with the butter we then needed more bread.  I had the spencer steak which was cooked okay but not very tasty.  Place has potential, but also has some kinks to get worked out."
1,Great tataki salad. great use of fruit and interesting textures in rolls. Amazing quality fish
0,"I went here for happy hour at 5:30pm on a Thursday and it wasn't too crowded. We sat outside which was a mistake because it was SO loud with all the bikes across the street. The drinks were just ok, and the brie appetizer was kind of a joke. Only served with 3 small pieces of bread? Most people order appetizers for at least 2. We asked for more and they brought it out free of charge. The service however was great so that kind of made up for the mediocre drinks and appetizer."
1,"Very good! Reminds me of my mom's cooking.\n\nThe chicken karahi is light but very flavorful. The portion is also really large. The chicken tikka masala was very good. I was a little disappointed by the goat biryani - the portion size was good, but the rice was dry. I also thought the raita (accompanying yogurt) was a little bland. The chick pea masala was pretty good, but a little simple for my taste. Still, it was nice that it wasn't drowned in overpowering spices.\n\nThe service is slow, but I think the prices are reasonable. I could definitely see this place becoming my go to Indian/Pakistani restaurant in Phoenix."
0,"I went in with my girlfriends for a fun saturday night to drink and gamble a little bit.  And I was surprised to find it truly was a very \""little bit\"".  I have never been to any place where I was told I couldn't tip.  I always tip the dealers, but then he tells me I could only bet certain amounts for him because now it's capped.  Seriously? \n\nI don't appreciate anyone telling me what I can't and can do with my money.  Don't they see how obvious it is?  They think that if I tip less, I'll play more.  Wrong!  I'll go to Red Rock from now on."
1,Seating wait time: 15mins (Sunday afternoon)\n\nFood time after ordering: 5mins for appetizers 35-40 min for entrees. \n\nFood quality: 5 out of 5\n\nWaiter: 5 out of 5  \n\nMe and my girlfriend walked in on a Sunday afternoon before our long trip home to California. It was our first time there so we had no idea what to expect. It was a bit busy and they do not have much room for waiting. The wait time to be seated was relatively short for the amount of people there. We were able to get our drinks and appetizers really quick after ordering. The problem was the entrees taking too long. The food was really great for a chain restaurant with the enchiladas being the best I've had in a long time. The waiter was great and was keeping us up to date about our food. Overall great restaurant with good food but get four stars due to long food wait times and poor waiting area.
0,"Just finished dining at Michael Mina's and must say I'm a little disappointed. I was expecting the food to be WOW memorable, but left with an \""eh, I've had better food for that price\"" in my head.\n\nThe decor was nice and the food decent, not oh my god I have to get some more. The service seemed distracted and we were so close to another table it almost seemed like we were dining with them. The noise level was quite loud for fine dining. I couldn't even hear my wife talking to me.\n\nThe only memorable thing was the tiny tasting of tomato gelee with avocado and shrimp we get for free. Oh wait.. That and the shock of the bill.\n\nIf you can make it for the pre show dinner then yes go ($55 for 3 course meal) what the food is actually worth. If not, then I would pass"
1,"Cherry Lash Lounge does just one thing - lash extensions.\n\nThere are three levels of lash artists. They are apprentice, artist and master, The primary differences are speed and price. \n\nThis is not a chatty social event. You lay on a recliner that is on a raised platform and your lash person works behind you. It is peaceful and relaxing.\n\nIt is often difficult to get an appointment so book in advance. They charge you $9 when you book and the balance at appointment time,"
1,"This is my go to spot when I am in the mood for sports bar food and atmosphere. A Blue Moon on tap with an orange slice, to go with some of the golden wings is the perfect combination for me. Zipps is one of my top spots in the valley when it comes to wings. If you are looking at something more for dinner the rest of the menu doesn't disappoint. The salads and burgers are great, but if you are looking for that one thing on the menu you have to try, its the Monaco foccacia. When I go to this place with 8 friends, 7 are getting the Monaco. As good as everything else on the menu is, I rarely venture away from the Monaco. The happy hour here is nothing mind blowing, but def worth checking out, $5 for a dozen wings and a few bucks for a 32oz domestic beer make it a budget friendly dinner before 7.\n\nThe food here is 5 stars for me. My one qualm with this place is they will charge you for every extra thing you order. We ask for an extra side of ranch and some celery..$3 dollars. And if you plan on splitting something, expect to pay extra. I worked at a restaurant under the same owners and they take off 7 dollars from every employees paycheck as a drink charge whether you drink from the soda fountain or not. point is these owners will nickel and dime you for every cent they can get.  \n\nOverall if you want a great sports bar to eat at, or a place to catch a game, this is the place you want to go."
0,"it's okay, like the vegan aspect. using tofu in place of paneer is not a good substitute, i'd rather go without than have the tofu in there, it's just not the right texture.  Spice level was ok, could have had more flavor, heat level was fine.  The \""veggie based\"" rather than cream sauces they tout are a great idea, but sit/walk by the kitchen and look around, you'll see big jars of veggie stock base. You know what that stuff is? Salt, more salt, msg, yeast extract, and some veg flavor.  C'mon, if you're trying to do healthy then why base all your sauces on fake flavored salt paste and pass it off as a healither option.  Honestly, i'd rather have the full fat, cream laden version that tastes so much better, at least it was natural."
1,Very nice lounge in MGM Grand.  This is where we did most of our pre and post concert celebrating.  The 311 concert was legit and the Centrifuge kept things rocking all day and night.  Loved the ambiance and the mix of musics and people.
1,"In addition to the name, which I love by the way, I really liked this place.  I went here with some coworkers after work for a couple of beers.  There were five of us, we each got an appetizer and each had two or more beers apiece and our tab was $50.  Not too bad for a couple hours of drinking on the patio.  They have a pretty decent selection of food and we all seemed to enjoy our fare (nothing special, just your typical bar food), and they offer mini pitchers of beer (I love that).\n\nMy only complaint is that they allow smoking on their patio.  It's just gross.  But, the patio is big enough that we just moved \""upwind\"" from the smokers and we were fine.  \n\nThis would be a great spot to go watch a couple of games on the patio in the gorgeous weather and have a few drinks.  I'll be back again."
0,"This is the worst Dunkin Donuts I have ever been to and I stop in at Dunkin Donuts at lot when traveling. I have been to this location several times in the last year since I moved to the area and have been frustrated trying to pay every time. They always seem to have one of two registers open and if you are there for one item and want to pay and get out you have to wait. You wait on the people in front of you who may have large orders or are also just waiting to pay because the person at the one register has already started to ring up a larger order. No shortage of people working there as I always see a few working on preparing orders and a few taking orders. However no one ever opens up the second register and for some reason can't as I have received an \""I'm sorry but the other person has to ring you up\"". Then you wait to pay for much longer than necessary. I have ordered coffee in the past and waited so long to pay the coffee is getting warm. They have no problem taking your order and preparing your coffee or getting a muffin but then you stand there looking at your order sitting there while you wait to pay. I have seen managers standing around chit chatting with employees or customers at the other end of the store with no clue on what is going on at the register. If the managers were doing a good job they would see the problem and open up a register to get people out the door. You would think that if they are only going to use one register they would not start to ring someone up until they were ready to pay. Not this place. No common sense here.\n\nWell on today's visit, I was fourth in line and the people in front of me had larger orders than me. Standing fourth in line I was asked if I wanted just coffee or donuts and I said I just want one muffin. My muffin was bagged and put next to the register. I walked up to the second register expecting that I would be taken care of so I could pay and leave. Nope, the person standing next to the register apologized and said the other person had to ring me up. I waited a few minutes watching people run around preparing orders and the person at the register standing waiting for the order she started to ring up to be completed. I noticed other people waiting to pay and realized this was going to take a lot of time. I saw who I thought was the manager standing at the other end of the store talking to another employee so I called to him and asked if he was the manager. He was and I explained the situation. However I was so annoyed at this point I just told him he needed to open up another register and get the people out who were waiting to pay. He seemed out of touch with what was going on and that annoyed me too so I just said that I did not want my muffin, he could keep it and I would not be back.\nI hope the person who owns this franchise reads this and wakes up to what is going on in this store."
1,Love the spicy chicken. Just tell them off the broiler and it will be fresh and juicy.
1,"I am a regular. I come every week and the bagels are just nothing like the others in town. Originally from the east coast, BB is the closest thing to a nice chewy bagel from home. \n\nI get the Tijuana hot. Omg it's amazing. The boys that work are so pleasant and such a great staff."
0,"Sadly this place has gone downhill since my last visit.Quite simply there is a lack of management and expediting in the kitchen. Also they are skimping; for example fewer ingredients in an omelette. Sadly, they are no longer competitive with other venues . The patio is very pleasant. Their pancakes used to be great; now they are hardly  edible  ."
1,I love this place. I would recommend the kiki burger with truffle fries and  extra dipping sauce.
1,"Shrimp & crab salad awesome, as well as the fresh oysters, great service."
0,"Looking for crepes? Go elsewhere. Not only is the food pretty bland, but they do not serve tap water to paying customers who are buying food and alcohol. Tsk tsk."
1,Excellent pizza. They do offer indoor and outdoor seating but very limited so I find it best to take it home
1,"One of the best meals I've had in Las Vegas. The menu changes daily and offers a wonderful variety of cheese, meats (fromage and carne) and flatbreads for apps.  I had the wild boar bolognese pasta for dinner. Fantastic wine selection."
1,"Meat & Potatoes is my favorite brunch spot in Pittsburgh! I highly recommend making reservations, especially if there is a show or game in town.\n\nThe first time my husband and I visited, we did not have reservations--but we arrived right when they opened; we were able get get seats at the bar., however, within 15 minutes of sitting down, there was not one seat left at the bar.\n\nMy husband and I both had a blood orange and caramelized pineapple Bellini-- it wasn't on the menu, but the bartender recommended it--simply delicious! \n\nMy Husband ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit special-- scrambled eggs, thick cut bacon, and cheese served on a giant homemade biscuit, with truffle mayo and a side of frittes. I had the omelette special, which had blue cheese and mushrooms, served with a side of their au gratin potatoes. Both meals were phenomenal! \n\nMy mom came with me on my next visit to M&P for brunch before we headed over to the Benedum to see a show. I made reservations a few weeks in advance, and I'm glad I did-- I overheard the hostess tell the party in front of us there would be a 1.5 hour wait! \n\nWe were seated upon arrival, and our waiter Shane was at our table in no time! My mom and I both opted for the Bloody Mary bar--we both had the garlic and black pepper infused vodka, and proceeded to top our bloody's with the amazing variety of toppings available. It's hard to believe the Bloody Mary bar is only $5! \n\nFor our meal, I had the BPLT and my mom got the Quiche of the day. My sandwich was delicious; this version of a simple classic had arugula, pastrami belly, thick cut bacon, ripe tomatoes, and truffle mayo all wedged between two pieces of grilled bread. I don't remember exactly what was in the quiche, but I think it had pork, peppers and scallions. It is served room temperature, which I found a little odd, but the flavors were amazing. It was served along side a house salad, which really balanced the dish nicely. We finished our meals with a cup if coffee, which was also delicious!\n\nThe service is impeccable, the drinks are fantastic, the food is stellar, and the manager stops to talk to the tables (which is a nice touch). I highly recommend stopping in for brunch in the very near future!"
1,"This has to be my Favorite restaurant in vegas. Probably the best meal I've ever had in Vegas. Our first time coming here. I thought there was something wrong with my gps when I came here. Its in the middle of no where. Theres a lit walkway to the entrance. When you walk in it feels like your in a time warp in the 1960's, I love places like this that don't change there d\u00e9cor it gives the place charisma and have a lot of history to it.. The Rib-Eye steak was probably the best Rib-Eye I've had and the service was outstanding."
1,Excellent get the house pho p1
0,"I was trying to figure out why I haven't written any 1 star reviews. I realized one reason is I don't want to feel responsible for a small business going under. Another is I'm pretty good at avoiding places that are likely to be a 1 star experience.  And as a rule I usually find some redeeming qualities like value or service. But rules are meant to be broken. \n\nEnter Boudreaux's.  The first visit I was excited to try their etouffee because I love cajun food and like the etoufee at Cajun Queen but alternatives are always great. First we had to wait about 50 minutes for our food and after it came, I thought the etoufee was awful and the taste was bland. Perhaps I should have gone with the jambalaya or Shrimp and Grits, though none of the people enjoyed their meal. However, the meal just got worse when the server was pouring my sweet tea (apparently above me) and poured half a pitcher of sweet tea down my back. The server was off in Lala land or might have been on something because it took a chirp, or yelp if you will, to get him to notice that there was something wrong. So he then stood there and said \""Oh whoa dude...\"" ... and so then I had to ask him to get a napkin or towel or something.  \""Oh, sure.\""  I don't make a big deal of things, so I laughed off the tea and apathy and attributed it to having a bad day. \n\nThen Mother's Day came around and I wanted to give it another try since it's an institution that has been around NoDa forever. They were having a brunch and I realize most places get overwhelmed for Mother's Day brunch, but this was truly amazing. The food took 2 hours and 20 minutes to get to us and was completely cold by the time it got to us. Really?? Really. So all we had during those hours waiting was weak bland coffee. They offered to remake the food, but I was worried it would take another hour or so.  Quel d\u00e9sastre! I usually give places 3 tries before I'll review a place but in this case after 2 visits I will unequivocally never go back.  \n\nSo if the food had been exceptional, sure, I would compensate the stars to make up for the terrible service, but it wasn't, so I didn't. I hope I never have to give another 1 star review again. It just makes me feel dirty."
1,"The Beehive is one of my favorite coffee houses in Pittsburgh.  Such a relief to come here - so unique and quirky compared to Char-bucks.  Great place to get work done.  Today I got a small house coffee (dark roast) and one of the best chocolate chip cookies that I have had in a long time.  Current renovations are going on - this place is huge with big mulitple rooms.  Pinball machines and board games and interesting lamps are scattered throughout the place.  Great music also.  Thanks for the buzz, Beehive."
0,"Friday night was the second time I've visited this place. Atmosphere was nice, pretty dark, servers were very attentive but the food was not something that I would go back for. Especially a third time. Prices are pretty high but I was out with a friend and didnt have the family so that was ok. But the food once again was just mediocre. I ended up having the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto. Sauce drowned everything out and made it very soggy tasting...The only thing that made up for the food was that I wasnt paying and my peach bellini (AMAZING)..."
1,"This is my second favorite location behind San Tan Harkins, it has alot of screens so there is always open seats even in the busiest times of the week. If you dont have kids and are looking for the day care some harkins have go here and watch a movie.\nPros -  Very clean, 25 theathers so just about every one is big, very good service, no theather police so movie hop away.\nCons - If you arrive at movie later in the day don't try to find a close parking spot they fill up quickly.\nComments -  Love going here for early movies when I dont bring my daughter to a movie she can't or don't want to watch."
0,"I really don't get it.\n\nI'm in Vegas for work and a coworker said lets go see a show. Spamalot looked like it might be good, and it was roundly well received here. Maybe I missed the part at the beginning where the whole audience got high, but the only thing funny about this show was how bad it was. For a comedy, it was uniquely un-funny. My favorite part was an off the cuff remark about the seat D101 guy's shirt from O'Hurley. I'm sure it's just me; the crowd gave a standing ovation and all the other Yelpers liked it. I just really don't get it."
0,"Decent food. We arrived and the bartender wasn't there yet so I didn't get my s'mores mocha until halfway through my meal. The service was kind of lacking, but the portion sizes are decent and the food is as I would expect at a diner.\n\nThe basic: The potatoes didn't really have any flavor and the chopped onions sprinkled through them were raw (ew to raw onions), eggs were a little under easy and runny, the biscuit was hard and broke into pieces and there were so many chunks of peach/apricot that it was hard to spread the jelly...but the chicken sausage was pretty good. Very filling.\n\nS'mores mocha: was a little bit disappointing! Didn't look like it does in the photo on the menu, and there was so much marshmallow it was hard to get to the mocha itself....\n\nAll in all... Not that great..."
1,"Pleasantly surprised, great drink specials and cute outdoor seating.\nFood was really good and I look forward to going back!"
0,"We used to go to blu for good sushi. But the good sushi comes at a price, lackluster service, long waits, and higher prices. Decided after last time not a place to hit before a movie (you won't make the movie) nor on date night (the babysitter ends up costing more due to the fact that your night just got twice as long).  Even when I stopped by to buy a gift card it took almost half an hour, seriously wow!  A couple hours of waiting at this place that I will never get back."
1,"We came here (22 of us) to surprise my mom for her birthday. We already love Charleston's for their food and service but they were able to accommodate my huge family and Brittany and Kevin did a wonderful job! I've been a server for many years and they did a top notch job dealing with such a large group. I never saw an empty glass all of our dishes came out right, plates were cleared in a timely manner and they even cut the cake, served it and washed the cake holder for me! Normally chain restaurants tend to let me down with poor customer service and unprofessional servers but Charleston's truly impressed us. Thank you so much for a great evening!"
0,"Ummm...well....they have parrots in the lobby....I guess thats a good thing.\n\nI would never stay here. A few of my friends are staying here and I went to visit them. Everything about the hotel needs a complete update. The rooms are old and smelly. The paint in the shower was peeling. The tv did not really work good. I think I could feel the springs in the mattress.\n\nIt is right across the street from Gammage auditorium .... so if you are visiting ASU I guess it has a pretty good location. But thats about it.\n\nOh yeah, there is an IHOP attached to the hotel,....so if you get fed up of your crappy hotel room you could always go downstairs and get some mediocre pancakes. \n\nI would give it just 1 star...but they allow dogs so I will give them 2 just because it always sucks trying to find a place to travel when you have your pooch."
1,"Great service, great food and nice atmosphere.  I liked that they had a lighter menu with fewer calories - definitely a bonus!"
0,"Reserved room a week in advance and requested 11am early check in, is now 3:45pm and we've been waiting at the resort all day. Classic bad business: under delivering after over promising. The Grand just a few miles away seems like a much better option."
0,Don't come here if you're in a time crunch. And $25 for a mediocre-at-best sandwich and coke? I don't care if it is sit down. No thanks. Skip this place.
1,"Pizza has a great flavor and the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce has Great Flavor, only too little sauce!  If you see my photos you may say it looks like a lot!  The service here is always very good!  I have to say I'm a fan because I eat here more than any Italian place!"
1,"This place is awesome.  Moved to CLT in desperate need of Korean food/people.  I got hooked up here with both.  Owner is very friendly and I can find everything that I'm looking for here.  My mom is back in California, but the owner told me to call her Mom... =)\n\ndmo out"
0,"Attended the Ancient Ales, Modern Science event with several others and was very disappointed. \nThe Ancient Ales that we had the privilege of tasting were fantastic but unfortunately only 1 or 2 of the breweries made it the whole 4 hours. We spent most of our night waiting in line for the breweries whose booths were open and didn't get a chance to see much of the Science Center, thankfully I was with good company."
1,"By far the best mexican food in Las Vegas, I've been coming here since 1998 and still go at least once a month, we get treated like family even when their slammed busy. 1 drink will put you on your ass, great service and amazing flavor. love their tamles yummm!!!"
1,"Its a Vegas landmark.   Really creamy, delicious and a variety of sundaes and toppings.  The only issue is they're very popular and sometimes theres a wait.   Adding something sugar free would rock too.  \n\nShe tells me it brings her back to custard she had growing up and its her favorite."
1,"Love this place, best gel manicure ever it last for 3 weeks+. People are super friendly, clean nice relaxing looking environment.  They have a loyalty program where you get points so far I have had gel nails done several times, pedicure and eyebrows and I have been happy every time!!"
1,"Postinos is one of my favorite restaurants in Arcadia!  The actual building itself is an old converted post office, complete with a closing garage door.  Great wine selection and the staff is extremely helpful if you have any questions or need a recommendation.  \n\nAs for the food, it is phenomenal!  I've had the roast beef sandwich, turkey and brie, bruschetta, salads, you name it.  I have never once been disappointed with my meal here.\n\nI usually opt to split both a plate of bruschetta and a salad with a friend which is always more than enough.  My favorite salad is the raspberry chicken and for the bruschetta the brie/apple, salmon, pesto/salami, and fig/proscuitto are by far my faves.\n\nThis place is great for a first date, birthday, or dinner with a small group of friends :-) Looooove it!"
1,Logan's isn't the best steak in town by any means... but it's a great place for the money. My family and I o there at least twice a month because they have such great deals on Tuesday nights. They have a great deal for two people for about 15 bucks that you just can't beat!\n\nTheir warm rolls are about the best I've ever had. Great atmosphere and friendly service. I consider this place a real bargain for family dining.\n\nThere is always an odd smell around this location though... not sure what causes it. But I guess they can't control the parking lot.
0,"Not good, although it was super busy. Out of two dishes at 8 pm on a Saturday, ordered the walu fish and came out not cooked, the then pan fried it to cook it, but it was not quality fish at all, and no flavor on a sloppy cheese sauce that was supposed to be a \""crab fondue.\""  It's trying to be more than it is and failing miserably, walk a few doors down and go to herb box."
0,I have adequate expectation of what sort of food I can get at a $4 buffet. I just don't want to share it with pests. \n\nI have noticed a happy COCKROACH running around the corner of the buffet floor this morning. When I was talking  to the buffet manager to bring his attention to the problem he demonstrated complete lack of interest and concern. He is probably used to and comfortable with the fact that guests share their meals with cockroaches.
0,"Let's be honest: health insurance may be the most morally bankrupt of our major industries.  Even the well-intended Affordable Care Act is the equivalent of putting a mere bandage on a spurting arterial wound.\n\nAnd Physicians Plus will fight to the death to avoid paying for that bandage. \n\nYou may not have a choice in your health insurance providers, which is fine.  Dealing with Physicians Plus, however, is like pulling teeth.\n\nAnd Physicians Plus will fight to the death to avoid paying for those tooth extractions.\n\nWe had a baby in September.  It's April now, and I'm still getting bills for standard procedures that have been denied by Physicians Plus (sometimes for the flimsiest of reasons).  I've had to submit several bills multiple times.  They'll cover eventually, but they'll try to wear you down (Physicians Plus will fight to the death to avoid paying for chronic fatigue treatment).  If I were cynical, I'd think they deny claims as a matter of course in hopes that their customers will just give up hope (Physicians Plus will fight to the death to avoid paying for depression treatment).  \n\nAll in all, you may not be able to avoid them, but they have been incredibly frustrating to deal with.  I'm happy that they are no longer our family's provider, and I hope that I can stop dealing with them before our daughter's first birthday.  I'm tempted to send them a little \""sample\"" in the mail (Physicians Plus will fight to the death to avoid paying for the sample jar).  \n\nI may just take that expense out of pocket."
0,The d\u00e9cor was nice but the acoustics make the restaurant very loud. A tray of wet glasses was on our table when we were seated and the hostess removed them leaving the table wet that she didn't wipe down.  The menu was wet with Coke spilled all over it. We wiped everything down ourselves. Not a good first impression.\nThe waitress was friendly. She brought our drinks but didn't bring the bread basket until the second time around. The Rosemary bread was very good but tiny slices about 1/4 inch thick.My husband had to ask for more. Two meals a pasta dish and pork chop dinner were very good but the crab and shrimp stuffed Talapia was not as expected and not very flavorful. It came with about 1 1/2 cups of Kale- that's a lot of Kale. Probably would have been better to eliminate the Kale and serve this dinner with a small dinner salad. \nThe worst part of the evening  was a table of misbehaved children sitting next to us. The kids were running around and playing with the drapes and screaming. Some parents just don't care if their kids are annoying  and being rude to other guests. This is not a restaurant for young kids. The hostess should have seen we were four adults dressed up (dress shirt and tie) for a special evening and sat us at a table away from rowdy children. There are many excellent restaurants in Madison. You have to be amazing in one way or another for me to return. Not amazing.
0,"Gennaros is sort of a hit or miss. Sometimes they are very well made pizzas but other times it is pretty generic and bland. Lately it has been the latter. Also STAY AWAY from their sandwiches. I had a chicken parm sandwich and it was awful,  I couldn't actually finish it."
0,"I work for a demo company for another wholesale distributor. We wear gloves, are not allowed to have ANY jewelry, and wear hair nets constantly. When I went inside of WinCo, however, I was SHOCKED to see that the people giving out samples did not wear gloves, most of the women were wearing earrings, and very few of them had hair nets ons. Not only is that unsanitary, but it's disgusting. Aside from that, the prices are great. Just don't eat the samples."
1,"I brought my girlfriend here to have her new shoes stretched after reading the other Yelp review. The owner helped her out immediately, her shoes were ready and we were on our way in 5 minutes. \n\nThe owner was really nice and helpful and didn't even charge us at all!\n\nI would definitely recommend this shop.\n\nCash only."
1,"the clarendon has one of the best happy hour restaurants we've eaten in. great fish tacos!\n\nwe spent our new years eve hosted by the clarendon. it was very inexpensive, at only 25 bucks. they hosted a Gatsby theme and luckily, most everyone showed up dressed to the 9's!\n\nthe party was held at their pool lounge area which had plenty of heat lamps and lots of room to move. or you could head up to their roof top patio which has amazing city views. there were heat lamps also. \n\ncash bar and a DJ for the party. it was nice to be able to move about so freely without constantly bumping into other party goers. \n\na couple of things to consider: the rooftop patio is floored with wooden planks with gaps in them. didn't bother me, but i noticed several women in their high heels get caught up several times in the gaps. \nthe DJ was ok i guess, but i did not care for his music. only towards midnight did people start dancing and he didn't interact with the crowd at all. all of a sudden, we just hear \""10, 9, 8,....\"" and that was it. \nlastly, the wine pours. very inconsistent. i believe a drink is 5oz, but the bartender only served us 3oz. later that night, i got a completely full glass. good for me?\n\nbut that's nitpicking. fun night and lots of taxis lined up outside to take you home!"
1,"Not bad at all.  The crawfish was meatier than a similar one in California.  The blue crab was also good.  The shrimp pieces were nice and big.  What I like about this place is that it has good seasoning to choose from such as lemon pepper, house special, cajun style, and one other I can't remember.  They give you a piece of corn and a potato for ordering a 2lb bag of crawfish.  The cajun fries are good, but you can get similar tasting fries at a lot of places.  The medium spiciness has some kick to it.  They have actually five levels of spiciness which is ridiculous unless you're a hardcore fan of spicy food.  The service was good, but maybe it was because I went for lunch at a non-busy time.  The prices are just a dollar more than California, but it's still worth it."
0,"When we called inquire about vegetarian options and whether or not they use lard in their tortillas and beans, the hostess was clueless about food ingredients and I was placed on hold for an inordinate amount of time. After speaking to the manager, we decided to try it out. I placed an order for a less spicy pico de gallo and when it came it burned the roof of my mouth. I asked if something less spicy could be made and was told that everything is pre-made. When the entrees came (we ordered the quinoa salad and fish tacos) I found everything so incredibly spicy that I ended up finishing my kids' quesadilla! Normally love Mexican food but am for sure going to skip this place next time."
0,Customer service here blows! I order online so there shouldn't be any confusion about my order. I open the box for my cinnamon sticks and there is RANCH for dipping?? I call the store and he offers to bring what I actually ordered but prefers to credit it from the order.... Uhhhh that should be credited and you still need to bring me what I ordered! Really Really disappointed in pizza delivery lately! Especially since your stupid tip was 30%!
1,"An outstanding restaurant.  We arrived a bit early and had drinks in the lounge before dinner.  Once seated at our table, the service was excellent and our dinners (surf & turf aka lobster & steak) were all top shelf.  They have an excellent wine collection and their desserts and quite good as well."
1,"In the Raw is just a great place to take my Golden Retriever on a nice, sunny Sunday afternoon.  We stopped by today after a long walk around the lake across the street.   They have a nice little courtyard/patio with a fountain...it's very relaxing.   Chloe enjoyed a bowl of ice water along with some carob/peanut butter Yappy Yogurt and six Mutt Muffins :)  She was in doggie heaven!  They have a variety of beverages and smoothies, sandwiches, bagels, muffins etc.  \n\nRight next store is a Subway, so my boyfriend and I enjoyed our lunch while our dog enjoyed her treats.  Overall, it's a nice place to just hang out."

0,"I felt so bad, still do, knowing I had to write this review nearly as soon as I got in my car. I hate writing reviews about places like these where people are so friendly and serviceable and helpful. But it must me done I guess.\n\nI really wanted to visit this store so we drove a good 15 minutes to get to it. I am not sure what I was expecting but it certainly wasn't what this place was. I am in love with  the South Blvd. location. It is one of my favorite markets in town. I guess I was expecting something comparable. Boy... was I mistaken!\n\nFor starters, this is the size of a shoebox. As we walked in the girl invited to try some free samples of \""healthy\"" soda made with Agave instead of sugars. We love agave sweetener so we said, \""hell yes!\"" Well, the soda wasn't great, we wouldn't buy it, but also, and maybe \""healthy\"" also means \""warm\"", but that's what the sodas out of the fountain were, lukewarm. Which just made them that much more unappealing.\n\nWe went there expecting to find lunch and their only grab and go area had 4 sandwich wraps, one tuna salad, three chicken salad. They all looked boring, limp and with nothing more than the salad and lettuce. Becky immediately reached over for the only tuna wrap on the half empty counter. After much deliberation, and circling some aisles for an alternative, I ended grabbing one of the chicken wraps.\n\nI also grabbed, what looked like, a delicious spinach salad in a plastic container. I'm already not the happiest customers.\n\nWe then proceeded to wander around the halls. The craft beer selection is awesome! and I am sure if you're into the products they have, you won't be disappointed. After checking out the beer I darted to the nuts/dried fruit/grain dispensers. The South Blvd location has an awesome wasabi nut mix that I love. This HHM on the other hand boasts of roughtly 300 different dispensers, all full of different kinds of nuts, grains, etc. They had it all... except for the fabled wasabi mix I was looking for. At this point I just wanna leave and eat my food.\n\nI'm not even gonna pussyfoot around the food... it was GOD AWFUL!! The wraps were soaked and felt as they had prepared it the previous night and let it sit overnight. There was barely any flavor to the pur\u00e9ed chicken that was plopped in my wrap, which also gave it a very odd texture. I could have made a better wrap at my house with a cold flour tortilla and leftover chicken.\n\nThe salad was an abomination unto itself. The first thing I did was stir it around a little bit since it was nicely section into walnuts, cheese and cranberries. The monstrosity they passed as shaved carrots underneath the fa\u00e7ade of nuts, cheese and berries was disgusting. The carrots were nastily soaked in god-knows-what and were turning brown. The Spinach was also soggy and the whole thing tasted bitter and old. I took two bites... that's it.\n\nI rarely, if ever, throw away food. but all of this shit ended up in the trash. Again, I feel bad because everyone in there was so awesome, but this experienced SUCKED HAIRY ASS!\n\nI don't plan on going back, any craves I have that come from HHM will wait until I am near the South Blvd. location."
0,"The first thing I noticed after being seated in the pedacure throne, is that its really cramped. Spinning this positively, I would say they make great use of their real estate.\n\nAnd LOUD.  This place gets loud when its busy.\n\nThe pedicure wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  I was having a hard time understanding my lady, but then again I don't understand a lot of people.\n\nOne lady was working in a nice black dress.  She sounded a lot like Anjelah Johnson.  \""Oh huney... you so per-tty.. like mah-duhl.\""\n\nSo, no, I don't plan on coming back, unless I'm in a pedi bind.\n\nNow for the hammer.  The sign on their window states \""$17.99 Pedicure\"". However, they charged my wife and I twenty-dollah.

1,"dinner in Paris... -sigh- maybe one day the real thing\n\nDined here for the first time and all went well.  Came here for dinner and food was great. We love meat and there was no shortage of it here. Plenty to choose from including roast prime rib, lamb, turkey and pork brisket. As far as seafood choices we had ice cold crab legs and they were already cracked open, actually, they were sliced in half to expose the crab meat. I had the salmon and it was tasty and delicious. Also tried the sauteed mushrooms... yummy! For dessert, there were choices of tiramisu, creme brulee, creme caramel... oh, yes, I tried them all! Originally priced at $30.99/ea with their rewards card. We used our dining voucher from our timeshare resort gifted to us. Lighting was dim and the atmosphere was themed as if dining outdoors in a village (hence, the name of this buffet restaurant). The servers were dressed as village locals. Had great dining experience here."
1,"I don't eat a lot of good buffets so I gotta give this a 4/5. Pretty good quality Asian food (all I really tried was the duck and the red pork because that's all I wanted for the moment). There was only one set of sushi and a lot of sushi rolls, they were all pretty good in my opinion. I don't know what people were complaining about the sushi for. \n\nThere's really good Asian food, some Mexican food, Italian food, and really good, boiled crab legs. The American meat (turkey, brisket, and others) were too smoky and dry, definitely could've used some work there. But otherwise, good stuff all around. \n\nThe decor, environment, and seating is excellent and puts you in a good mood for the food. \n\nLOL, the people whining about how long the line is. What the hell do you expect, just wake up early before the opening and you get in easy. Otherwise, pay for the express  and just go in. If you're not willing to pay for the express line, I don't see how you afforded to come to Vegas in the first place."
0,"I'm sorry but the employees at this location are RUDE. I asked for help and they were upset because I interrupted their personal conversation. They want you to spend all your money. I asked if they had any deals and they rudely said \""No\"" but then when I went to go pay for my stuff one of the workers allowed the customer who was  checking out next to me use multiple coupons. I bought an outfit for my Daughter while she was at school not knowing if she was going to like it or not and she ended up seeing something at a different store for half the price, so I went back the next day to get my money back (the male at the counter said I had 30 days to get a full refund with receipt) and when I went back the girl at the counter said she was only going to give me store credit. I said \""I don't need store credit, there is nothing here that I want to buy and the guy told me I can get my money back before 30 days\"" She was very upset, started slamming things around, was very rude and she ended up getting so frustrated that she made another girl finish the transaction and she went to help another customer. I love Childrens Place but I will NEVER again return to this location!"
0,"Worse pedicure ever!   This place is nothing but a factory.  I had been there once and swore I would never go back. Went to my regular salon and they were closed for remodeling so needed one fast for an occasion.  Polish at Stonecrest is close by so I thought I would give it another try.   Mistake.  The male that did my pedicure talked to the girls working there and paid no attention to what he was doing. Clipped a little on my toes, \""massaged\"" my legs for about 1/2 minute each and moved on.   My feet looked no better than when I arrived!  The whole process took about 20 minutes! \nThat is my last visit there.   A waste of money."
0,"If you're only needing a cleaning, this is a safe bet. The hygenists are polite and do quality work. However, for fillings,it was the most painful, unpleasant,disappointing experience.\n\nI already had fillings by a dentist out of state & knew I needed one more for sure. Dr Shim wanted to do  5 fillings including replacing a few silver ones that were only a few yrs old ( That should've been the 1st clue!). I trusted and allowed 3. The anesthetic,he admitted,was too strong - numb literally to my eyeball plus I suffered bruising at the injection site.Dr Shim is very quick, deliberate, firm and has an aggressive approach. I had to make a 40 mile round trip to his other office the following morning because the original office was closed & he hallowed out so much out of the middle of the 3 teeth that it left the outside edges thin and sharp. When I got there he shaved down those sharp edges. Now when I chew food it feels like I have baby teeth there that don't do anything. When I told him these teeth are now short & my bite is uneven, his response was \""I can't control that\"" and \""Well, we need to do more fillings on the other side anyway\"".\n\nI sent a written complaint to the office. There was no written reply."
0,"I came, I saw.  Feh, I was unimpressed.  The two star rating Meh I've experienced better was the closest to that sentiment, so that's that.  So let's go over the pros: it's in the downtown area, it's close to the old \""Igloo\"" where the Penguins used to play, close to the new Fill-in-the-blank Energy Arena (forget the name)...close to businesses (think I saw a convention center there?).  \n\nPretty pathetic though for a hotel to offer \""shuttle service\"" to major city points (such as PNC Park, which was what I was there for) and a) only have ONE operating on the weekends (while several things were going on in town) and b) not run after game nights?  What gives?  now, I understand that around the stadium, it's tough to pick up since it's mostly pedestrian only and one of the draws to the area.  But something's gotta give.  Luckily, I'm a New Yorker, I walk everywhere, and it was about a mile away from the stadium.  But it was raining and I was none too happy.\n\nWhat else?  I got this as a Priceline deal, so I guess beggars can't  be choosers.  Room was good, I was there for only an overnight...will i be back there?  I'll visit Pittsburgh again sooner rather than later, but this place? Never. Again."
1,This restaurant is great once in a while and they are open late. It was average service and prices. They have a few big screens if sports are your thing.
1,"Nothing bad to say about Bayside. The payment kiosks are convenient and easy to use. The wait in line is very short. The wait staff was on top of things and was on point with refreshing drinks. \n\nI went for a late breakfast / early lunch so I got to sample a little of both. They had some flank steak out which was delicious and I have to mention the watermelon. Bayside had some of the juiciest most flavorful watermelon I've ever had. The only knock is the omelet line. Obviously a very popular station, so if you really want one you are going to have to wait."
0,"Is it just me or did I miss something? \n\nWe had a late dinner, and since Raku was booked we opted to try here. It's romantic and intimate, but I left feeling disappointed. \n\nBraised Short Ribs of Beef - It was good, the short rib was braised well although a bit salty. I didn't really understand or like farro risotto. \n\nDuck & Foie Gras Ravioli - I like Foie, but I just wasn't a fan of this. The texture reminds me of cow brains. It is also very rich. \n\nShort Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti - This was OK, but nothing spectacular. It was also a bit rich, and the horseradish was a bit too much at times. \n\nMediterranean Orata - The seared fish was good, but nothing too special. Fish was almost too slimy. \n\nAfter reading all these great reviews, I'm starting to feel like I missed something. I'm not sure if it's my palate or if the food is just overrated? Everything I tried was really rich in flavor, and I left both pastas half finished. Maybe I went in expecting too much? If anyone feels the same as, please let me know. I can't be the only person that feels this way right? \n\nService was good, except the host looked like she wanted to go home badly."
1,"Not too shabby ,get the blt mmmm"
0,"This location only gets 2 stars because their customer service is up and down. Some girls seem genuinely nice and others are snobbish! Wish Arizona would focus on good customer service but that's a bit much to ask for I guess? \n\nOne employee that was working the floor ignored me when I asked a question the first time and when she finally answered my question, she was short with me and didn't seem to care. But when another (white) customer asked her a question, she was peppy and attentative to her. She has long black hair, I might as well be describing every employee there but its worth a shot. \n\nTreat all customers with respect or at least fake it! Not going to this location again. Gbye!"
0,"Blech! This is the worst breakfast buffet I have ever had! Golden Corral was a much better buffet at half the price!\nThe biscuits were cold and hard, pancakes had no flavor, bacon was dripping in grease and the eggs were overcooked.\n\nIt is also self service on the drinks, so the only good part is you don't have to tip! I will never cheat on the Paris breakfast again."
1,"I didn't have any if the - experiences as other yelpers. It's 1am and my very nice waitress Elizabeth just cleared my plate. Got the steak and eggs for $6.99. My boyfriend, also. He ordered rare and myself medium rare. (Elizabeth did ask both steak and eggs preference for preparation) they were as ordered. Hot and delicious. I added some salt because I like kidney failure. The usual standard toast and hash-browns, as expected. I don't know how anyone could complain with what we experienced. My water cup was refilled before it was empty, we didn't wait more than 2 minutes... Two! And our check was dropped as we ate. Loved it. Very satisfying after walking allllll day and having pizza for lunch! Thanks Flamingo :D"
0,"There are a large amount of stores here on a number of levels, but it's difficult to find anything (see Stripburger).  There are information kiosks/maps, but they are horrible at telling you how to get anywhere (see Stripburger again).  While they generally tell you where you are, they aren't particularly good at telling you where the elevator/escalator/stairs are to get to the next level.\n\nSo: There's a food court at the top level, all the way at the end of the mall, but if you want to go to Stripburger, it's at the bottom on the same end of the mall, on the outside.  Everything else?  Just wander around.  You'll enjoy it more.  If you go looking you might have a tough time."
0,"This place has completely gone down hill.  I just ate here after several years of visiting other pizza places and I was sad to see what it has become.  I have never seen a restaurant skimp on a pizza as bad as this place did.  Hardly any sausage, tomatoes sliced as thin as a piece of paper and no garlic on the pizza which was ordered.  They never have enough sauce but I expected that and always get a side.  Ridiculous.  Beer was even flat.  Oregano's blows this place away.  I have been in town for 25 years and went to Nello's all the time 15 years ago.  So sad to see how they have gone cheap on their pizza.  If you are looking just to get full, go for it.  If you want any type of quality, look elsewhere."
0,"They had excellent customer service and did a great job however they weren't honest with me about their prices. The nail tech was trying to get me to upgrade my full set to a gel, so I asked her the price of the upgrade and she said it was only 5$ more however (after she did it) I was charged 20$ more! it was just too much for me I would of never agreed to it had I known the true price. just so everyone knows they charge 45$ for a full set with gel polish. I'll say again they did a good job, and if they had been honest about the price I would return again but I don't appreciate being lied to."
1,"The service is friendly and fast, the food is exactly what you'd expect from a large chain. No real surprises, the best part is the regulars at the bar. Lots of fun."
0,"I don't know why I continue to waste hundreds of dollars at SBE restaurants when I've never liked a single one. I keep hoping they're going to live up to the hype and they never do. The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is that for once, the server didn't act like we were privileged to be dining there like they do all ALL the SBE restaurants in LA. She was actually friendly and nice, not snooty.\n\nFirst, I called for a reservation 10 days in advance after seeing nothing available on the day we wanted (Friday 9/5) on Open Table. The girl on the phone said nothing was available until Tuesday 9/9. A few days later, I looked on Open Table and 8pm on Friday was available so I booked it.\n\nWe get there on time and the place is 70% empty. I wonder if they just keep spaces open for walk-ins, yet they don't tell you that on the phone when you try to make a reservation. The place stayed empty until about 10pm when we left.\n\nWe ordered the foie gras cotton candy, chicken croquettes, beef Carpaccio with parmesan, peanut fed serrano ham, flat iron steak with blue cheese, baby corn,  and Anna potatoes.\n\nThe foie gras, croquettes, carpaccio, and ham were good, not amazing. The flat iron steak was bland, the anna potatoes were so saltly, they were inedible. I sent them back and they still came back covered in salt. They forgot the baby corn and the steak took so long, they sent out a free gazpacho, but that wasn't good either. I didn't realize that they forgot the baby corn until hours later, but at least they didn't charge us for it.\n\nBottom line, go to Animal or Bestia in LA. You'll save a hundred dollars and have much better, creative dishes."
1,"We have always loved Oreganos, but my wife was recently diagnosed with a gluten allergy.  Many pizza places in the valley now have gluten free crust options.  Oreganos, please get with the times and add a gluten free crust option!!"
0,"I came here quite excited to try a new place.  The name has Taco in it, so I'm thinking delicious mexican food.  Well, it wasn't anything worth willingly going back for.\n1) I felt the food wasn't worth the money spent (luckily I didn't spend any).  I was told to get the corn dish, and that it would be good.  Well it was definitely unique.  It came in a bowl with a line of lightly spiced popcorn.  And it was good...until I bit down on hard popcorn kernels 3 different times.  And that was my limit.  Word to the chef; I would definitely suggest making sure there are no kernels in your popcorn if you're going to season and disguise it on a bed full of seasoned corn.\n2) My dish was so small.  Only two tiny empenadas and that was it. No rice, no lentils, no side salad; nothing else to enjoy with it.  Quite disappointed.  I knew I didn't want anything too heavy to eat, which is why I ordered the veggie empenadas, which were good.  But by the time I left and got back home, i was hungry all over again.\n3) Typically I wouldn't complain about a drink, and maybe the machine was bad, but I just don't do well with any kind of watered down drinks, but their lemonade was oh so wrong :(\n\nOverall, it was a forgettable experience, and I certainly don't plan on spending my hard-earned cash here any time soon, at least definitely not intentionally."
1,"My first experience with STK was at the NYC location, and I was hardly surprised when they decided to bring an STK to my current digs in Los Angeles -- a city that has its fair share of trendy restaurants that lack culinary inspiration. Suffices to say I was less than shocked when I heard the Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas would also feature an STK restaurant. \n\nMy experiences at all three locations have been markedly different. The NYC location boasted good food and a classy atmosphere in the Meatpacking District (an area which wasn't hurting for culinary hot-spots at the time) and was able to deliver consistently, even in its nascent stages (I moved out of NYC shortly after it opened so I wasn't able to see how the restaurant fared in the later stages of its existence). While the steaks left something to be desired, the restaurant was trendy and the overall experience was fun. I'll unabashedly add that, hands down, the best steaks still come from Texas. \n\nWhen the Los Angeles restaurant opened, I was happy to see that same ambiance maintained, but unfortunately, the food was inconsistent at best (definitely nothing to write home about) and it's \""trendiness\"" quickly declined within its first year. STK LA's biggest redeeming quality was (and still is) its proximity to other LA nightlife hotspots, and the location is enough to get me there with a group of friends for some cocktails and light appetizers to kick the night off. \n\nFast forward to 2011 and the latest trendy hotel in Vegas, the Cosmopolitan, now boasts its very own STK. A group of us made up of my closest friends from Texas, New York and California were staying at the hotel for the weekend to celebrate my birthday, so we decided to check out STK. I tried making a resie through the hotel but, annoyingly, the restaurant handles its own reservations and my call was promptly directed to their hostess. Getting a reservation was easy enough -- I called 4 days in advance of our arrival -- and we figured 9:30pm would be a good time to eat before an insanely late night of dancing. Our group of 4 arrived on time and the hostess informed us that the wait would be half an hour...with a reservation. Disgruntled, but determined not to let the unfortunate news spoil our mood, we proceeded to the bar to have some very expensive, very plain drinks -- if you are price-sensitive and like to imbibe, then this is not the restaurant for you. \n\n45 minutes later, we were seated and STARVING. This is when things got exponentially better. Our servers were incredibly fun, enthusiastic and attentive. Throughout the entire meal, our waitress helped us by making great recommendations, taking photos of us to help commemorate the trip, and showering us with an endless supply of complimentary birthday shots as well as a celebratory dessert plate, replete with delectable bite-sized cake and ice-cream lollipops. Crisis averted. Be sure to request Raquel M. as your server -- Raquel and her fellow cohorts will make sure you have a blast. The restaurant manager even let us explore the kitchen, meet the chef, observe the plating ritual and peruse all the fresh ingredients. The kitchen was very clean and well managed and the staff was very friendly. \n\nThe giant seafood platter we ordered was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone but me (I'm picky, obvi) --  the king crab was a little soggy for my taste and the oysters left me underwhelmed -- and the steaks were actually better than the ones I had at the NYC and LA locations. I ordered the ribeye medium rare and the cut and flavor were excellent. Still not on par with Texas steaks, but as far as the STK chain goes, I really enjoyed my meal.\n\nNet/net, while the steaks at STK restaurants are not my favorite, the ambiance is usually pretty fun and the staff at the Las Vegas location absolutely made this experience worthwhile. If you are staying at the Cosmopolitan and/or looking for a fun/trendy place to eat before you head to Marquee, this is the place to go."
0,"I used to love Paradise Bakery. They had such good salads. But the last few times I've eaten there I noticed their food has gone way downhill. It's so bad, I won't be eating there again. Too bad :("
1,"I've starting getting shellac manicures on a regular basis because of C&C. It's clean and the prices are great for nails that last 3+ weeks! \n\nIt's a one-woman shop, so don't expect to get in in 24 hours. As a regular client I get priority treatment, which I appreciate. When I've had to change my appointments (which is a little too often!) I've had minimal trouble getting a reschedule. \n\nI love the range of fun, funk color choices and enjoy some quiet time in the :45 that I'm there. She also keeps up on cute trends, Keep up the good work C&C!"

The same lady did my friends nails after me and cut her as well!! \n\nSure you get what you pay for but still $19 bucks for a french manicure is still money, just hold on the cutting my skin and the bleeding! \n\nI will not go back."
0,"Stopped in with my friends to enjoy a raspado and had the worst customer service experience. As soon as we walked in the door the owner approached us and gave us a flyer for the boost mobile store down the street, I thought it was a bit odd. Am I here to get a raspado or to have a pushy guy give me a flyer and tell me to go buy a cellphone?\n\nWe placed our order and stood in front of the other counter where he was preparing our food. As we're waiting another customer shows up and instead of having the lady at the register take her order he stops making our raspados and goes over to the customer and gives her a boost mobile flyer! It was just so bizarre, my friend tried to tell him she wanted her ingredients mixed together and he was completely rude and condescending.\n\nHe doesn't know how to talk to people and isn't a good business owner in my opinion. I ordered the rompope flavor and it was okay but I would never go back to this establishment based on the way my friend was treated.\n\nI also think that the people giving this place 5 stars either didn't deal directly with the man I'm talking about or don't speak Spanish because if you do you'd pick up on his extremely bad attitude."
0,"OK so this is not the place to stay for sure.. We had a ton of issues .. The 1st room no heat  , then it was dirty, then the next room was old and smelly.. I will say the staff was ok . They are better places to stay for sure."
1,"This place is the ultimate place for an awesome great tasting american style mexican food. \n\nI was introduced to this place by a knockoff in vegas, that was soon replaced with the real deal and have yet to find anything in this place i do not like. \n\nEveryone I have brought here has loved it and become a fan. The enchiladas are awesome and my wifes favorite. I like a pork burrito with mild sauce black beans and rice....the flavor will stick with you forever. \n\nI highly recommend this to anyone! I do wish they would open up more locations in the valley so I can let my other family members in surprise fall in love.\n\nI even had them cater our wedding rehearsal dinner..."
1,"I almost hesitate to write about this best-kept secret in CLT, but the JLW is without doubt the best friend of a person trying to dress respectably on a budget.\n\nThey've got a lot of nice clothes rolling through their shop, including a lot of good dress clothes, and the difference between JLW and the Salvation Army is that the JLW goods are in better shape.  Much better shape.  This means you're going to pay a little more, but it's worth it and then some.\n\nAnd while there, check out the housewares section.  They've often got really useful gadgets on those shelves."
0,ECK !!! Not Going Back. It Was The Land Of Bland. The Only Saving Grace Was That It Was 2 Fer February. No Need To Trash Food Items Individually. I Wonder What It Was Like When Stations Owned It.
1,"Greatly favored chicken, healthy portion size just wish the pricing was more economical."
1,Love this place! I had a Ruben and my husband had the signature roasted turkey and stuffing sandwich. Food was EXCELLENT ! ! Mac and cheese was nice and hot and the orzo salad was seasoned perfectly. Only reason that my rating is not 5 stars is because of the clunking noise coming from the beverage cooler. Very annoying. Don't pass this place up if you're in the area. Will definitely be heading back soon!
1,"Great place to hang out and drink good beer or be a good designated driver like me.  \n\nThe fries are my favorite thing on the menu!  However, the Green Chile Pork is amazing and my Mom refuses to order anything other than Beer Battered Fish & Chips."
1,"I wanted a change of venue from Yardhouse for Happy Hour, and Steiner's did not disappoint. They have a great selection of food and booze at extremely reasonable prices. I had their Cuban sandwich which was delicious and several potent drinks. When the bill came I was shocked how much less it was than at Yardhouse. The bartender was friendly and attentive without being awkward and annoying. I would recommend this joint for happy hour.\n\nThe crowd is generally old and although it wasn't smoky that day, smoking is allowed. So beware if you are sensitive."
0,"Do not be fooled by the fact that they have the same location and phone number as the previous florist at this location. (Green Wood Pecker was awesome.

1,Trust this review. After 40 years of boat ownership I wouldn't take my boat to anyone but Gerry for service or repair. I heard of him from a friend about 10 years ago and he has been my shop of choice since. His knowledge and quality of work is unsurpassed and his prices are very reasonable. Thanks for being there for us Gerry. You and your guys are awesome.
1,"Great middle eastern/Eastern European  grocery in the southwest part of town.  I have been shopping here for nearly three years and have always been greeted by smiling and friendly staff. This family owned shop makes amazing fresh breads, dips, kabobs, and lahmejun (Armenian meat flatbread).  Was recently inspired to write a review from this giant green salad I got along with some of my baked items.  It was huge and fresh.  The meats are great to take home for some BBQ or just have them grill the meat for only $1 more a pound.  They also have a great selection of European beers and wine you won't find anywhere else.  Some of my favorites here are the beef salamis and spicy sojouk, olives, cheeses (especially blue), carrot salad at the deli and sardines.  Yum!"

0,"The line to get into Serendipity 3 is usually pretty crazy, so I try to bypass that with the To-Go line outside.\n\nThe Frozen Hot Chocolate (and it's cousins in different flavors) are ok. They really aren't that amazing. So if there is a really long line, move on, you aren't missing that much. Plus it doesn't really taste the same as the one you would get at the original Serendipity in New York.\n\nAnd for some odd reason it took a good 15 minutes for them to make my Classic Sundae. Scooping some ice cream into a cup and pouring some hot fudge on top really should not take that long. And to make matters worse, the $10 dessert was 2/3 whipped cream. I thought I paid for a sundae not a freaking can of shaving cream.\n\nOh and if you were eyeing the sliders, you might want to squint a little bit because those things are teeny tiny."
1,"Strip clubs and Vegas go hand in hand, and Olympic Garden is exactly what you'd expect to find here: a semi-seedy place seedy enough to fill your Vegasy expectations and clean enough to keep you there for a while. So sit back and enjoy the ride.\n\nOlympic Garden is a trip. Downstairs you've got the women dancing on small, circular tables, surrounded by Vegas voyeurs. The voyeurs run the gamut from locals to tourists to women. I even saw a drag queen taking in one of the girl's shows. Watching the people sitting at the tables is just as entertaining as watching the girls, I dare say. The women dancing here were all pretty hot, I thought, and not shy to ask you for a lapdance.\n\nUpstairs you've got the men dancing on certain nights. Guys can go if they've got a gal-pal and are \""a couple.\"" The guys will come up to you, the guy, and hilariously ask if \""your lady\"" would like a lapdance. Try and keep a straight face, nod in approval, and watch as \""your lady\"" gets a lap dance right before your eyes. Some of the guys were hot -- some were not, like straight off a Harlequin romance novel cover.\n\nIn terms of sociological observation opportunities, you can't beat this place. Compare and contrast the culture downstairs (\""keep your hands under your legs -- don't touch the girls\"") with the mayhem upstairs (\""slap that ass, baby\"") and you've got yourself enough stories to last a lifetime."
0,"I have used Bridewell once before and was pleased with the service. Lived in Scottsdale at the time - now live in Gilbert. Pleased with the service I was willing to make the drive from Gilbert to Scottsdale and before doing so i called to ensure i could be accommodated and communicated that i was coming from Gilbert, reviewed the cars service needs, and that I likely would arrive at 8:45. Being fairly new to the valley and not having a large network, I planned to be in Scottsdale for the day while my car was being serviced because I didn't have someone to pick me up. I Loaded my computer, my bike, and my patience cap knowing it would be a long day waiting for the car but was willing to do so. I planned to take the car in on a Wed but wasn't able to make it. By 9AM I called to let them know and to confirm it would be OK to come up Thurs. Thurs morning I arrived at 845am as I had previously mentioned and was told they were too busy to work on the car and I'd have to come back.  I just drove 50 min from gilbert and made very proactive calls to ensure I could be accommodated.  Nothing was done, no shifting of other cars. I was then told it was 1st come 1st serve. Why wasn't that mentioned when I called...either time. They said well we thought you were coming yesterday.  I said yes but I called. They said yeah we were swamped yesterday too. My response was if it's a 1st come 1st serve method I would have been out of luck then too and I specifically mentioned twice I was coming from Gilbert and would arrive at 845. They don't start working on cars until 8AM. They suggested I leave the car but couldn't guarantee anything would be done. Really? I'm going to possibly waste a day in hopes the car gets serviced? I took time from work was very proactive in planning and am so tired of companies not giving a hoot. The right thing in my mind would have been for them to keep their word to me and break the bad news to another individual because they didn't plan on their end. I did more than enough to plan on my end and that they could accommodate it. I don't recommend them because they made no realistic attempt to right the wrong. Wasted 2 hrs in drive time, gas money. My loyalty to them meant nothing."
0,"Handicapped unfriendly .  The non-bar eating areas are all down several steps from the entrance level. This typically wouldn't be a problem except at BJ's.  The ADA required ramp is at the BACK of the building and the only way to get there is through the long, crowded and furniture-filled bar.  Impossible to navigate with a wheelchair or walker most of the time.\n\nIf you can't handle stairs, stay away from this place."
1,"This restaurant was great!  The menu had a lot of variety and options, although I would have liked a traditional Breakfast plate with pancakes, bacon, eggs, etc.  Then again, it's a French restaurant, so it wouldn't have necessarily been fitting...\n\nI arrived around 10:30am on a Sunday without a reservation and the wait was about an hour long.  After waiting for 20 minutes or so, I asked if we could have a full meal at the bar.  The hostess told me we could, so I found two seats near the end and sat down.  \n\nService wasn't super attentive.  I was kind of disappointed that no one checked up on me after I got my meal... Especially disappointing since typically one sits at the bar hoping for great service.  And based on the bartender/bar patron ratio... there was no excuse.  \n\nI had the Corn Beef Hash with two over easy eggs.  It was OUT OF THIS WORLD delicious!  Would definitely recommend the food.  \n\nAtmosphere is cute -- very french bistro like.  \n\nOverall, not a bad experience.  Had the service been more attentive, it would have been a 5."
1,"Club Tanning was the site of my very first bed tanning experience, and I'm very happy to say that it was pretty sweet. Katie the desk girl was great, answering my hundreds of questions cheerfully and being totally helpful without attempting to sell me anything I didn't inquire about. \n   The salon itself was clean, and the prices and products were laid out very plainly. On your first visit you fill out one sheet of paperwork warning about medications that can cause a bad reaction when tanning, then you choose your desired package and are given a room number. The rooms are simple, they have an empty lotion bottle that says the room has been cleaned, a couple of towels, a pair of those little goggle things, a chair, a mirror, a fan and some headphones for your music of choice. You push a button on the wall that turns the bed on and starts your timer, then lie down or stay standing for your desired time and you're done. Clean up and leave, they'll even hold your bronzer or whatever you have if you'd like. \n   This is my first membership to a tanning salon, so I can't really compare prices, but it seems fair to me, I think unlimited tanning starts at 30 a month, or you can pay for each visit standalone. \nI know this seems a little long winded, but I went in to this totally clueless, so if you're new to tanning I completely recommend Club Tanning, the staff is helpful, the salon is clean and the whole first time process is as simple as it could be."
1,"The first thing I'd like to say, is that the service was awesome as hell. The woman that served us was down to earth, cracked wonderful jokes and was easy to talk to. She also gave honest opinions on the food and told me I should have my oyster steamed rather than raw. She was right, the oyster was tasty steamed, not so much raw (I think it's because I'm not used to eating raw oysters). The oysters were not the best I've ever tasted, but it was tasty.\n\nThe waitress was very attentive and would come up to us with the slightest eye contact, or even when we didn't call her, she'd come to ask if we're alright or not. \n\nThe salmon was incredibly delicious! Tender, smooth texture, and it really just makes you go mmmmmmmmmm~! But really, the best of the best at Big Als is the BOSTON CLAM CHOWDER! Oh god it's super delicious. It had rice and meat and oohh man mmmmmmm~! Super creamy and just the right texture. I couldn't stop taking a bite! By the time I was finished, it was all gone and I felt extremely satisfied. Not to mention the appetizer bread they give you goes great with it. Well, the bread alone is already delish! I would DEFINITELY go here again the next time I visit Las Vegas. YUM!\n\nThe only reason why I docked off a point was because of the oysters. For an oyster bar, it didn't fit my expectations for a 5 star rating. Everything else, however, is awesome!"
1,"I have returned to Discount Tire Co and this location is fast and professional. Used the website, found the tires I wanted for the price I wanted to pay, placed the order and everything went almost very smooth. The problem was the website said they had the tires I wanted in stock and could be mounted on saturday. Turns out they had to be ordered and took a few days more for delivery, but all in all a good experience. Trying to forget my past dealings at some of their other stores, but would come back here again. They don't do wheel alignments but did send me to a local business that did a wonderful job. (Nationwide Safety Brakes and Alignment on Boulder Highway)"
1,Very good indian food.  Went with a bunch of co-workers and had a variety of food.  I had the chicken biryrani and vegetable samosas - both were delicious and so was the naan.  I tried my friends rogan josh and chicken tikka masala - the rogan josh was very good and the masala was probably one of the best i've had.  Will definitely come back here again.
0,"My bf and I drove in from \""the city\"" lol and met some friends here for brunch.  We didnt have to wait long to get seated which was great.  The waitress came and took our drink order and right away she didnt seem too thrilled.  So I ordered an omelet and asked for turkey sausage instead of the toast or pancakes it came with, she looked at me like I was asking for a cure to cancer and proceeded to tell me that I would have to be charged full-price.  Well duh, I kinda figured and since I asked it was probably ok.  Needless to say, we waited 30 mins to get our food, which we had to ask her for.  My omelet was cold, I didnt get the turkey sausage I had ordered but she did add it to the check.  Thank god we had a groupon or else it would have been a total loss.  The Breakfast Club in Old Town is better!"
1,"First time- quick, great cut! Called in on day of and booked, arrived at appt time, offered a beer (a comp beer is a comp beer..not sure why somebody would complain about that), nothing too fancy about the cut or atmosphere BUT much better than anywhere else so far, good music, and the massage is a plus. Relaxing hot towel+shampoo, styled and headed for the door.  Definitely going back!"
0,Very disappointing! There are a lot (and I do mean A LOT) of excellent places to eat in Vegas for the similar price. The food was mediocre at best. Not worth the price. The shrimp appetizer was the only good thing we had.
0,"I have been to clubs/bars all over Vegas, and several other cities in the US, and never have I experienced such a poor attitude of the bouncers, and obvious money grubbing of these guys.  I had been here before and wasn't really impressed, but stopped in on thursday night after deciding to see if things had changed.  The line was pretty long, and we had 3 girls and one guy with us.  All of the girls had gotten some free passes to the club, and I managed to talk to the bouncer, slipped him $50 for us to skip the line, and also to pay for my boyfriends entrance.  We walk up to the line, where the other bouncer is standing, and the bouncer blocks my boyfriend, and asks for MORE money.  At this point we argue, but end up giving him an additional $20 (stupid I know!) and finally get to the point where we pay.  The cashier asks for AN ADDITIONAL $20 for my boyfriend.  He was PISSED.  We explain the situation, the bouncers deny any money was given to anyone, and my boyfriend decides he is going to gamble, that we should go in, and try and enjoy ourselves.  I had already spent $70 just to get into this place, so I was curious.  Nothing special.  The crowd was YOUNG (mainly 20's) and mainly GUYS.  They looked like they were on their daddy's dime, and i wasn't impressed with the bartenders as well.  Being that I love the Wynn so much, its a shame that a club like this lends itself to such a classy hotel, being that everything I experienced at Tryst was less than class."
0,"All it takes is bad attitude and the unwillingness to be flexible for your customers to turn a good experience into a bad one very, very quickly.  Unfortunately, this happened at 360 Physical Therapy, who I was ready to write a pretty stellar review for, based on PT service alone.  I liked my therapist on the whole, and I've felt like I was taken decent care of. \n\nHowever, the practice has a rather draconian appointment-cancellation fee. It doesn't seem to matter that I have paid them countless $35.00 co-pays (ludicrous and laughable, I know... but that's between me and my wicked insurance provider) and that I call them if I I'm so much as stuck at a traffic light and will be five minutes late... we are battling to the death over an alleged no-show appointment that I swear upwards and down I rescheduled prior to not attending.  The billing manager will not let it go, and insists that I must pay this fee, no matter how many conversations we have about it.\n\nThe point here is, folks: isn't it worth it to keep your customers happy? I know I didn't miss this appointment... but even if I did, I had countless sessions at this facility. I was always on time, and I always paid at the time of service. I was a \""Good Customer.\"" And I would be going back, and recommending my friends, if it wasn't for the fact that they are unwilling to let something so small go.  Unfortunate, I think."
0,"So disappointed in this place! I've been going to Vegas for some time now and I've always wanted to try this place. We sat at the sushi bar area since there was a wait. Our waiter was nice and attentive. We ordered pot stickers, not a bad choice. Then we got Kung Pao Chicken and Coconut Shrimp. Eh, the chicken was bad and I did not enjoy that dish at all. The shrimp was dry but it had a good flavor. They were big shrimp too.\n\nThe drinks were amazing but I went for the food. At the end of dinner we got a pass stamp for Tao Night Club. We didn't go.  Honestly, if I had to chose between Tao and PF Changs, PF would win."
0,"Greedy monks. All I can say\n\nRequires a minimum of $50 per person for \""donations.\"" \n\nOn major holidays they won't even supply plates and utensils for the people to eat the food. \n\nThey YELL at you. I grabbed a paper plate from somewhere and this woman snatched it back and gave me a stink eye. \n\nMonks are always seen at casinos gambling. \n\nI used to work at Coach Inc. (purse store) they would go in and shop all the time. \n\nNow I saw them at apple buying 2 iPads with our donation money. \n\nScrew this corrupt place and their corrupted monks. They don't even follow the rules of Buddhism. This place is a joke."
1,"Went here during a buffet night. I was very happy to find that they accept BitCoin, yay! Its just too bad I didn't have any in my BlockChain account lol. The food was decent, but a little bit bland at the same time. I would probably give them 4 stars, but I didn't have a reservation and they slid me right in, so they really deserved the extra start for going above and beyond.\n\nI would definitely stop here again, but I'm also not sure when the buffet typically takes place. I know its just once per month."
0,"This hotel smells awful.  It's a mixture of cigarette smoke and coconuts.  It's overwhelming.  It gets on your clothes and on your skin.  I had a reservation for 4 nights, but I moved out after spending just 1 night.  I had to wash all my clothes."
1,"I've been here three or four times, and in all those times I've only been disappointed by a single cupcake that seemed to be a bit too dry to have any real flavor. However, I can now say that that instance seems to be the exception rather than the rule. I always have to get a red velvet, and my new favorites after this holiday season are the salted caramel and pumpkin spice. It's like magic in my mouth.\n\nOne comment though - none of these workers ever forget to bring their enthusiasm to work. Normally I would list that comment as a compliment, but when the first thing I hear at 9:00 in the morning is \""OmG isn't life just MARvelous and OmG you are FLYING home today and you DON'T live here?! Well that's SO exciting and we will TOTALLY get you a bag that you can take your cupcakes in, OBviously\"" - let's just say it is a little overwhelming.\n\nAnd fair warning, you really need to love cupcakes to be willing to pay $22 for 6. But let's be serious, I'm definitely going again next week when I'm back in town :)"
0,"Another Meeeeeh option in The Venetian food court. They have pizza and pizza related items as well as breakfast.\n\nThe breakfast was not good (eggs, sausage, potatoes). I still have no clue how one can mess breakfast up.\n\nPizza was whatever, not worth they money they charge. \n\nThis place is one of the only late night food options in the hotel, so many people like me don't have a choice when trying to grab a bite at 4am after a night out."
0,"If you want sandwiches walk a little further and try the best in Vegas @ PH's Earl of Sandwich. I guess the English IS better than the French after all!!! Here, the Sandwiches were OK (my Friend's order)!! I ordered the French Onion Soup. Was looking forward to it but was disappointed that it took 20 minutes to pour out of their bucket into their paper cups!! Service, presentation and food were not good!! love the Paris buffet across!!"
0,"This is one of the worst bagels + cream cheese I have ever had. \n\nOrdered blueberry and everything bagel, both with lite cream cheese (yes, lame).\nI requested it to be toasted, it was not. Both bagels were dry, plain, and very disappointing. And they put WAY to much cream cheese on. \n\nMaybe I went wrong with not getting a breakfast sandwich but if you can't nail the basics, you are done for. See attchaed pics for, err, the bagel that came with my cream cheese."
1,"This was our first time painting pottery & we chose All Fired Up because of the great Yelp reviews & it didn't disappoint! My family & I had a great time choosing our pieces from the tons of options. The staff member walked us through each step & got us set up to work. We had a blast with all the colors, stencils & stamps. They even helped my kiddos with their technique & helpful hints to improve their pieces. I can't wait to see the final product after they have been fired."
1,"Best fast food I've ever had! \n\nHad the butter burger, cheese curds, and a blizzard style custard with reese's pieces and cookie dough. When I got the food I was a little weary because it looked like really small portion sizes for the price, but everything is so high quality and delicious :)"
1,"When I arrived in Scottsdale, I drove past this place on the way to my hotel. I knew I had to stop in and try their gelato ice cream. I was pleasantly surprised. They have so many flavors to choose from. I felt like I was in a gelato buffet :). \n\nI tried several but my favorite two were the cookies and cream and the olive oil. This place is very clean, has a great selection of gelato, and very relaxing and situated in the heart of old town Scottsdale. If you are looking for a cold gelato/ice cream this is your place."
0,"I came to watch a friend's Roller Derby match. The facility looks like it may have been pretty great once, but doesn't appear to have been maintained well. The floos don't seem like they've had a good cleaning in a long time. Everything just seems a little dated and worn out."
1,I've been to the Los Angeles location a few times. This bar was the perfect finish to our night out in downtown Vegas. I'm a beer fan and the draft selection didn't disappoint! The vibe was hip with good music and a good looking staff (young tattooed babes for sure) I also really loved the dark castle-like aesthetic too.. Made me feel like a midcentury badass ;)
0,"We has a few minor issues with the service we received. Day one: Said they would come and cancelled out at the last minute. Day two: Came several hours after our scheduled \""window\"". Once service was completed, the techs very aggressively demanded immediate payment, even though we had previously agreed to pay by credit card over the phone. I called the owner to discuss these issues, which I will always do, prior to posting a poor review.This is where things really went south. Owner was combative, confrontational and treated me as if my concerns were unreasonable. Honestly, he was just plain mean. I am really, really tired of people being mean just because they feel like, so if you feel the same way, find another company."
0,One star tells ya all you need to know. Occasionally there is a good band but most of the time this place is just another smokey bar.
0,"This place needs work...\n\nI'm sorry I tried twice and I'm afraid of coming back here after the last experience. The first time i came here with my sis and the guy, the food AND service was awful. I thought I'd give it another shot and I did-- and I don't know what the hell I was thinking. I should've left when the guy and I walked in and the place only had about 8 patrons including the both of us. We were seated and the lady seemed nice. Scanned the menu and looked at the prices, and it seemed pricier than the other breakfast places. Anyway, to make things short, we were seated, drink orders were taken, lady said she'd give us a couple of minutes--uh, more like forever. She even apologized she said she thought we were still looking at the menus, but really we were looking at our phones(YELPING..). The guy ordered steak and eggs(15 bucks) and I ordered two eggs(over easy) with a side of toast. Again, we waited. Not as long as we did earlier but it seemed like a while. THEN, the food came. Oh wait did I mention they \""don't do medium rare steak orders\"" here. And it all made sense. The steak was bad! I mean it stank and it was old! Not to mention the fact that it made my bf sick. I should've told him to stop eating it when I smelled it. Uggh... And then came my eggs....how do you mess up eggs??!?!? Over easy--not sunny side up. Damn it cracked egg...\n\nI really wish we enjoyed this place as much as the others did. But really? I'm probably being  generous right now by giving them two stars. \n I'm not sure if I would come back and try other things on the menu but if I did, it'll be a very long time."
0,We ordered ribs to go and when we went to pick them up the staff didn't even acknowledge me. Took about 10 mins before they actually brought over my food - which they didn't even ask if I was there to pick up food. The ribs weren't amazing. Felt like they were made from a neighbor's backyard. Was hoping that they would be fall off the bone kind of ribs but they were definitely not.
0,"If you like waiting then this is the company for you.  The people are fine but forget about punctuality, it's not here.  Take a cab and save some time."
0,"This place definitely does not do food like kittens do cute..  \n\nSo we got the Luis(?) basically a shaved meat sandwich with mac and cheese subbed for fries and the trio of chips and dip.  The chips were salted VERY inconsistently - some chips didn't have any salt and some would burn your tongue it's so salty.  They are also very stingy with the sauces - they only fill the cups about halfway with the salsa, guac and queso.  The flavor of the salsa and queso weren't bad but the guacamole was basically a hacked up avocado with a few tomato pieces in it.  Bland.  \n\nThe sandwich wasn't the worst, but was hard to eat.  The veggies are arranged on top like its supposed to be open faced and the shape of the roll also makes it kind of ambiguous.  I tried both ways, eating open faced style and tucking the veggies inside and biting sideways but either way its kind of messy.  Anyway, the meat is barely seasoned at all.  An au jus or some kind of aoli sauce or really ANYTHING would have helped it a lot.  The mac and cheese wasn't bad.  The sauce got a bit chunky when it started cooling off but otherwise the flavor isn't bad and they didn't overcook the pasta.\n\nSo the food was not awful but not very good and at about ten bucks a pop, I'd rather go to about a million other places so I think I probably won't be back.  I'm seriously getting flashbacks from a couple of those chips.. (not the good kind either)"
1,"The Bellagio hotel is breathtaking!  As you enter the Bellagio your eyes are drawn to ceiling to the 2,000 hand blown glass blossoms that make up the magnificent a Fiori di Como  by glass sculptor Dale Chihuly. As you check in it is easy for your eyes to roams over the shoulder of the friendly staff who are checking you in as they are drawn to the amazing floral display.  But this is just a prelude to the spectacular Conservatory & Botanical Gardens which is like walking through a imaginary wonderland of exquisite flower displays, dazzling water features and unique rare butterfly atriums.  What could ever top all of this you might ask?  The amazing Bellagio fountain show!  It never gets old!  Every time I experience the music, combined with the beautiful water display my heart swells! There is something so emotional about the experience!  I recommend trying to get a reservation at one of the many Bellagio restaurants that have outdoor patios overlooking the fountain.\n\nDuring our visit we stayed in room 28072 which overlooks the fountains!  The room is in a quiet part of the hotel away from elevators, service closets, etc. The room had a modern blue and white decor which was extremely calming!  The room and bathroom are spacious.  There is a large window to view the fountains and it adds a certain open feeling to the room.\n\nThe Bellagio pools and courtyard is very beautiful!  It is composed of 6-7 different pools surrounded by tons of trees and lined with private cabanas!   They have a large drink list and a reasonable menu however I recommend having a nice relaxing lunch at the pool cafe!\n\nDid I miss anything?  Yes!  The amazing restaurants, clubs and poker room!  The spa is beautiful!  \n\nOther note worthy items:\nGym fee is already included in room/hotel fee\nHotel does NOT smell like smoke! \nStaff is really friendly\nRoom 28068 which my mother in law stayed in is right across from servers closet which can be very noisy"
0,"The food was ok. The service was extremely slow! We were 2 of 10 people in the entire place and it took almost an hour to get our food. I got the Mediterranean chicken which they told me would take 25 minutes to cook, which would have been fine except it took about 50 minutes. I doubt we will be back here anytime soon."
1,"Stumbled upon Zucca one night when walking over to the Traverse. At the time, the boy and I looked at the menu, looked at each other and promptly decided 'Valentines'. The menu had plenty options for meat, fish and vegetarian eaters alike, it was hard to pick really what I wanted to try first!\n\nFor Valentines itself, there was a set menu for 28 quid (3 courses). This little cafe/restaurant had their delivery down pat. Although clearly preprepared, the food was of such high quality you could forgive them for working round what is such a high turnover night for restaurants. The waiting staff (or at least the lady who served us) were discreet, and efficient, allowing us time between courses to pause but not to start to wander. \n\nTo the meal: as we sat down, my eye was immediately drawn to the table arrangement. Now, I don't normally comment, but on the table was a little tray of salt, pepper and oil with just the smallest dab of balsamic vinegar. It almost looked like a work of art in itself to match the flower arrangement and candle. \n\nAs it was Valentines day, I treated myself as the non driver of the night to a Valentines cocktail, a martini-based strawberry infused concoction, with (I swear) a hint of herb - basil? Might have imagined it, but it was a delicious aperitif to start the evening. I followed it up with a large glass of Nero D'Avolo, more of an acquired taste, which arrived the further I travelled down the glass. The boy tucked into a rose prosecco, which was like a trail of bubbly lava going down the throat. \n\nTo the food - for starters, I had roasted Mediterranean vegetables with rocket while the boy had wild mushroom tart. I think this was the only time I felt a pang of regret for the preparation style as the vegetables were refrigerator-cold, where I expected them to be even a little warm still. Nonetheless, great texture, great flavour, and the mushroom tart tasted lovely as well, although the pastry was a little hard for the boys taste (re-warmed, we suspected). \n\nWe also tucked into warm rosemary foccacia (oh, so, so rosemary good, I haven't eaten bread this delicious in a while) and olives while we waited for our starter and took the opportunity to mop up olive soaked oil as well as the balsamic-dipped oil that had so caught my eye earlier. \n\nAnyway, back to the main course, where I had a beautifully cooked piece of salmon, resting on top of a spring onion potato cake (you know that goosebump feeling you get when you tuck into slowly cooked, caramelised onions - well, this one would have had you at your knees) and sauteed spinach surrounded by a lake of creamy herb sauce. The boy had ribeye steak in a green peppercorn sauce that in his words, melted in the mouth and he had never had a steak cooked so well. My my, strong words, but I believed him. A side of garlic foccacia bread had us stuffed to the gunnels, but in such a satisfied way.\n\nFinally, we both had the passionfruit sorbet as a light finish to a sumptious meal. I was expecting something sweet, but this sorbet was sharp as they come and super, super cold, having also been pre-prepared (frozen strawberries at the bottom were a giveaway). Doused with prosecco, it was a welcome accompaniment to the sharp sorbet.\n\nSo in summary, Zucca, you are sharp as they come. Highly recommended and definitely glad we chose you for our meal last night."
1,"I'm a big Popeye's fan so I like my fried chicken crispy and a bit spicy. I wasn't disappointed with Bojangles. It's juicy and flavorful. You can also try their special bbq and white sauce. Both are pretty good, but the chicken can stand alone on its own. Their dirty rice with bits of meat and sauce is nice as well. If you are from the north, and happen onto a Bojangles in your travels, try some."
0,"$16.99 for 2 fish tacos, beans and rice? Seriously? Had to ask 3 times over a 15 minute period for an iced tea. Thoroughly disappointed. Didn't even finish the tacos, beans and rice were terrible, service was way below average. Granted,  the waitress had way too many tables to cover by herself,  so I can't fault her. I definitely will not be returning to this establishment. Nacho Daddy? Nacho Customer. Sorry."
1,"BabyStacks Cafe is definitely on my list of favorite places in Vegas. Not only do they have great breakfast food, but the atmosphere inside is so relaxing. Upon walking in the first thing I heard was the local music playing in the background.  I haven't heard any local music since I last visited Hawaii during the summer, so it was a very nice surprise. \n\nThe menu at BabyStacks Cafe definitely reflects that Hawaii feel as well. There are some great breakfast selections such as Portuguese sausage & eggs, Rick's adobo fried rice, and of course the pancakes. I decided to try the red velvet pancakes after reading many, many, many positive reviews off of yelp. I also ordered a side of seasoned potatoes because of my HUGE potato addiction. \n\nThe red velvet pancakes weren't disappointing at all. Keep in mind they are sweet though, so if you don't care for sweet tasting foods I would stay away from them. The red velvet pancakes are served with whipped cream, chocolate bits, and a side of cream cheese syrup. The combination of all of those toppings definitely leaves a heavenly taste in your mouth after every bite. The seasoned potatoes had the perfect amount of seasoning and wasn't overpowering at all. The texture of the potatoes was slightly crispy, which I enjoyed very much. \n\nI definitely recommend that you try this place at least once. Be warned though, there is always a long wait to be seated. Also, the cafe is only open during select hours during the day, so be sure to double check those before heading out!"
1,"I was so impressed with this company from beginning to end!  I used their services to move furniture within the house from down stairs to upstairs.... Changed my mind a couple of times and they were so accommodating... \nI had the \""best\"" guys EVER!!!\nEric and Coby!! \nI will use them every time... Thanks guys!"
0,Bruchetta at happy hour...awesome.  Real chef prepared food (not prepackaged nonsense like most restaurant chains).  Nicer than average wine selection (reasonably priced).  \n\nThe very good food was the only thing to save this place from  complete disaster.  If they get the service up to par they could easily be 4 star (I might even give them a five).\n\nThat being said.  The service was slow and seemed to have trouble communicating with the kitchen.  They brought our food out separately rather than all together so some of us nearly finished before others in our party even had food!  Some of the restaurant's  management types were sitting at the bar doing something...they seemed oblivious to what was going on inside the establishment!!!  BOOOOOO.  So sad to see a place with such potential be mismanaged so badly.
0,"i love the style of the place,the food was ok... not great... I didn't order anything exciting though... just burger and fries.. i think they could have a good business if they expanded hours and worked the bar angle more... they have a good place for it but only open til 11.... the wagon of salad was funny."
1,"Awesome place for lunch in the area. These people know good Mexican cuisine.  I had the carnitas burrito with red sauce. Chili sauce \""wet\"" is the way to go, trust me. Carnitas were tender and juicy. Also, it's family owned/operated. Nothing \""commercial\"" about this place at all. Just real, flavorful food."
0,"Based purely on service. . .  10 people (3 groups),  10 minutes,  6 empty tables,  2 servers,  0 eye contact,  0 acknowledgement to  people waiting to sit.  Horrible,  maybe burgers are good,  but I do not like being ignored."
0,"Pros: Clean. Consistent quality with other chain restaurants.\n\nCons: My friends and I came here on Wednesday night. I think we were dressed appropriately (especially since everyone else in the dining room was wearing casual clothes and shorts). However, the hostess refused to seat us in the dining room. Maybe because it was all Caucasian people in the dining room and we were a party of 2 Asian girls, 1 Caucasian girl, and 1 African American girl. The hostess attempted three times to get us to not eat in the dining room. After I refused, she grudgingly sat us near the other patrons. This set a very negative tone for the rest of our meal.  I had the root beer (bland), calamari (can't see why it gets such rave reviews), garlic fries, and lobster bisque."
0,"So so so bad. I planned a night with my husband at Camelback Sahara/Hotel 502 because I got such a steal on Hotels.com. We looked forward to it and the pictures looked decent. But it is so bad! From the minute we pulled into the parking lot we considered just driving back home! (We left the baby at Grandmas hoping for a fun night on the town).\n\nThe location is good - central and a few blocks from Central rail station - but it is a Days Inn. It has Days Inn TV's, Days Inn room numbers, Days Inn carpet, Days Inn water pressure (none). It is literally an old Days Inn that they are trying to turn into a hip resort (slowly... and cheaply).  They had two nice employees (three, if you count the friendly guard dog who lives upstairs), and the pool was DECENT. But there were black hairs on our bathroom floor, USED/empty shampoo and lotion bottles, and I wanted to shower from just sitting on the bed. DONT DO IT! Gross and scary!"
0,This place has the worst service I've ever seen in my entire life. I sat down at 7 with my family for my beautiful mothers birthday. It is now 9 and our food hasn't even come to the table. Also the waitress spilled a drink all over the person next to us. This place is horrible every time I come the food is decent at best for a restaurant that is supposed to be this nice. And the 2 hour wait definitely doesn't make it worth it. DO NOT COME HERE unless you plan on spending most or all of your adult life here. This place sucks and holy shit I just got my food... Typical average at best. The only thing this restaurant is good at is making excuses.
0,"Apartments seem nice and located right on the greenbelt near old town scottsdale. But I have never dealt with worse customer service in all the apartments I have rented.\nI came in on a saturday and waited 20 minutes to talk to the only employee who was working. He was casually taking his time with the couple, which is to be expected, but failed to greet me or offer any literature while I waited. After showing them the model, he went on to talk about his favorite foods and his trips overseas, without any sense of urgency to help me out. Then when they finally left, he answered the phone and tended to other tenants who had walked in, not giving me any attention at all.\nThere was no follow up after I was shown the model. Since I liked the location I figured I would move there. Every time I called, I had to leave a message, no one answered the phone. It would take a day or two for him to get back to me.\nI handed in my application, and a girl called me back that day. I was very happy that she seemed much more in to customer service than the man. But that was all. She said she would call back in two days after the application process came back. She did not. I called the next day, and of course had to leave a message. She never returned my call. I had to call a couple more times to get a hold of her. She sent me the lease via email and the dates were wrong, so i emailed her back. She never returned my emails. I told her I wanted to see the apartment the day before I moved in to make sure it was what I wanted before signing the lease. She never called, nor returned my messages and emails asking for this. I got her temporary assistant on the line who said there was nothing she could do, as the manager had gone home for the day. \nSo the day I was suppose to move in, I went to another complex. I figured if the customer service was this lousy as a perspective customer, how would it be if I ever needed something fixed, or anything else I was having problems with. Within 2 hours, I had looked at an apartment, filled the application, signed the lease, and moved in! The best thing about Chazal, besides the location, is how good it makes other apartment properties look!\nOh, and of course, I never had any sort of follow up to ask why I hadn't moved in the day I was suppose to from Chazal...."
0,"so not impressed with this place.  We made our reservations back in February.  We received a call telling us that unfortunately they won't be honoring our reservation due to the fact they have over sold.  They weren't over sold when they took our reservation and deposit, but now we are screwed.  We lose our airfare and show tickets if we do take what they are cramming down our throats.  \n\nMust be nice to be have a 5 star rating.  They reminded me of this 4 times during the call where they were telling me I was screwed and I should be happy with what they are giving me."
0,"I'm a Vegas regular, and thought Monte Carlo was supposed to be one of the nicer hotels ... Not so. Just returned from two nights there, and will not be back to MC. To start I had to change rooms b/c the first room had the carpet along the baseboard completely off the wall - they were nice and quick about changing my room. But, all the rooms need serious updating ... the bathroom was loud (toilet and sink were very loud) and shower was dark and tempramental with hot/cold water. There is no honor bar or refrig in the room, and the surface areas (desk and dresser) are minimal - the furniture was very old and dumpy. The bed and pillows were comfortable - but that was the only decent thing in the room. Oh, and the walls are paper thin ... I could hear the young kids in one adjacent room, and then at 4am I heard the women returning back to the other adjacent room ... and always could hear people in the hall.\n\nI picked MC partly b/c of the nice pools (lazy river and wave pool), so my minor daughter could have fun. She did ... but I was very uncomfortable in their pool area ... VERY crowded with lounge chairs - you can't move them, and there aren't tables or even ground space to put your bag, and very few \""cabana boys/girls\"" to help you find a spot. Of course the best spots are the premium cabanas, for premium prices ... no thanks. Also, it's very claustrophic with all the buildings surrounding and encroaching on the pool area. And, to top it all off, my t-shirt was taken from my chair! (Thank goodness my ID wasn't taken, but my shirt had been on top of the chair and when I returned from a spin around the river, it was gone. I checked lost and found numerous times, but it never turned up. Tacky ... I thought the clientele would have been better.)\n\nThe only highlights were that the food court was decent for families (McDonald's, Rubio's, Sbarro etc.), we didn't have to walk miles to get from self parking to the elevators or pool, and bed was comfortable (when the noise from the hall or adjacent rooms didn't keep me awake). Oh, and they get a decent amount of TV channels including Nickelodeon for my pre-teen daughter. \n\nThank goodness I \""got a deal\"" to stay here ... if I'd paid more than $90 a night (with their bogus resort fee) I would be really PO'd. For now, it's just live and learn, and never return."
1,"Best shaved ice I've had in a long time. I come from Hawaii born and raised and I'm used to the traditional shaved ice from Matsumoto's (near the North Shore of Oahu). I would recommend ex-strawbinary with mochi, boba and custard.\n\nBlack sesame is amazing too, but an acquired taste."

Not mention that we found hair in the sushi, and told our server, what she said was : uh ok, would you like another new one?

1,"Jason's Di is pretty good, their sandwiches are average. I haven't found one that I crave and have to keep coming back for. I do love that they have a nice fresh fruit bowl that actually has good fruit in it and isn't filled with cheap musk melon fillers and the best part is the dip it includes is amazing. I would come back here frequently just for the dip. I'm sure it's not healthy and takes away any benefits if the fruit but oh well. I also love that they have a frozen yogurt machine that you can help yourself to"
1,"I really like this bank, the staff is friendly and always take care of what I need.  I hate talking through the glass with bank tellers, and that is never a problem here. The design is nice and when I walk in its easy to relax, and then everyone is nice and they smile.  This is the best banking experience I have had.  We now have our personal and business accounts with Midfirst bank."

It wasn't hot and the cheese had just reached its melting point, and served on a cold platter and the food wasn't hot! \nI decided not to eat today! Maybe another day! \nI did share with manager on duty! Again I can only say if there is a problem or concern ask to speak with a manager!!"

0,"The WORST nail salon experience since moving to Henderson in October! Here's why:\n\nMy young daughter and I came in as walk-ins about 6:30pm and were promptly told that they close up at 7pm. When I asked if they would have time for two full mani/pedis, they said YES. We picked out polish and were seen fairly quickly.\n\nAnyone who has had their nails done anywhere is used to the fact that the salon workers will occasionally speak their native language (Vietnamese here). What I did not like about this place right off the bat was that the salon workers carried on loud, lengthy conversations in Vietnamese without any regard for their clients. It was obvious that they were talking a lot of shit about their clients in the salon. It was an uncomfortable, unpleasant experience. I was raised bilingual, and was always taught that speaking a foreign language in front of people who can not understand it was RUDE. Plain & simple. \n\nMy young daughter picked out some trendy polish for her nails & toes. She was on the verge of tears when she left the salon because the nail tech was rough with her and told her that she didn't like her color choices and that they were ugly. WTF?! Who tells a kid that??? Last time I checked, the client picks whatever they like. Way to treat a future client! I was really upset that my daughter was treated this way. \n\nMy manicure tech was rough and caused two of my fingers to bleed. My gel french manicure was ok, but it had a couple noticeable mistakes in the tip polish. Attributed to pure laziness and rushing to close up and go home. My pedicure was the only thing that looked decent, however, rather than being allowed drying time inside the salon, we were rushed to pay and rushed out. My toes were not dry when I left the salon. Honestly, NOT worth the money I paid.\n\nI will not be back to this salon and I will be letting all of my friends, family and co-workers know why. Pure shit. I will be making the drive to North Vegas to my favorite salon. It's worth it and I should have never left for something closer."
0,"Very disappointed on Veterans Day. This restaurant has offered free meals to Veterans on Veterans Day in the past and they advertised a military appreciation dinner. Many Veterans showed up at the restaurant while we were there expecting the free dinner. We were all disappointed to find out the restaurant decided this year to serve the free dinner 6 days after Veterans Day. What an insult to the men and women who have and continue to serve this great nation.  I have patronized Golden Corral many times at many locations around the U.S. And may I say this restaurant had the worst food. The salad, steak and cookies were the only things I ate that tasted good. Everything else I gave back. Pizza on crust as thin as paper. Ribs taste like cardboard. Cooked vegetables either undercooked or overcooked. What a waste of money for me and my family especially when two of us retired from the military and celebrated a day that meant so much to us. One last thing: they only offer military discounts to active military. Be it known the majority of retired veterans continue to serve our military in some way after retirement."
1,"I don't know why others had such a problem with the owner Petey: I went in for the first time last weekend and he was just fine. Perhaps its because I've learned over the years how to communicate to boutique shop owners that I'm not \""just looking\"" but I'm on a hunt for the perfect fucking end tables and I hate chrome.\n\nYou would be surprised how far that approach goes at any place: tell the owner what you like and don't like right away. Letting them know you have an opinion allows them to engage with you as someone who appreciates design; not just another customer.\n\nNow with that rant out of the way, I'd like to let you know that you'll find some cool shit here. Its a serious challenge to see everything there is in such a cramped place, so plan ahead to spend some time there. And for the love of God, don't bring your kid. In fact, go alone so you can make it around easier.\n\nYou wont find everything in perfect condition, but the prices are very reasonable. I felt like I was getting away with murder when I picked up a lamp last time. Go support Petey and his dog, they're good at what they do."
1,"First off, most people don't know what they are saying. The English guy behind the bar is very attentive and his wife makes the best cupcakes I've ever had. This place deserves six stars, however, yelp in all it's wisdom only allows 5 so that will have to do. So take your girlfriend and \""bite her and twist\"" your way down to this place if you have a sane brain cell left in your head. It's no accident the accidental connoisseur is the second best thing besides the English bloats wife's cupcake that you will put in your head here."
0,Pretty rude telling us to wait and then on top of it they do not accept the Starbucks cards here.  We walked out....too bad cuz we are gold card holders too.  Will not return to this location based on the rude service alone.  Across the street is a much friendlier location\n\nI am reviewing the Starbucks inside the Barnes and Noble.....terrible
1,"The highlight of my last Las Vegas trip, it's a great place for those hot Vegas days.  I think if you come here, you have to get the frozen hot chocolate of course, but the other items were very good, although I probably did OD on the sweetness.  It isn't cheap, but the portions are huge, you definitely could share most items.  I think the environment is fun, although there was a bit of a wait, and the staff there seemed a bit distracted.  I will definitely be back nonetheless."
0,"This was our second time at Crudo. We enjoyed the pig ear appetizer and poltenta board the first time that we decided to bring some of our foodie friends with us.\n\nI ordered the Brisket Ceci, Sausage, Peppers, Olives, Pumpkin Seeds, Salsa Verde $18 over poltenta. I received it and there were three slices of brisket, two of which were inedible as they were 90% fat. The third slice had approx. half meat and half fat.\nWhen the waitress came over and asked how everything was, we complained about it and she said, \""It's brisket it's supposed to be like that,\"" in a somewhat rude and acquisatory manner (like we wrong to say something). After trying to find some edible pieces to eat, we realized it was a terrible cut with all fat, we called her over again and told her to take it off the bill - which she did.\n\nLessons learned - although Crudo has some great menu items, it's over priced and doesn't always deliver. The waitress insinuated that we were wrong and that brisket should always be 90% fat. Sadly this changed our opinion and we won't be going there again - off to Fox Restaurant Concepts."

0,"horrible experience ! This restaurant makes us feel like they are dishonest. One waitress appears very very sneaky.  This was our third visit and our waitress was very rude. she talked to us with disrespect and treated us like crap,! we just sat down and wanted to have a peaceful dinner. then when she handed us our bill which  we found out that the waitress added a few dollars tip without informing the us.  She wrote the amount on our bill! this place is very dishonest. Hiw can they write their own tip onto customer bills without telling the,? we are never going back there again. if you want to risk going there, make sure you check the bill for every item....do not be fooled!"

1,"Hubby and I were so incredibly happy when we saw that there's a place on the Mainland that has Meat Jun.  We were so excited to try it out and this place did not disappoint.  The Meat Jun is just as good as in Oahu.  For those that don't know, meat jun, is Korean BBQ marinated meat that's dipped in egg batter and then cooked.  It might sound weird but it's so good.  We also tried the BBQ chicken and the short ribs and both were great.  Service was super friendly.  Get that aloha vibe.  Made me miss Hawaii so much.  They served the typical Korean side dishes but they also served sliced up sauteed hot dog and onion and I've never seen that before but it just hit the spot.  So simple and so good.  I think we'll be coming here every time we're in Vegas for our Meat Jun-fix."
0,"The \""famous\""  truffle chips are glorified kettle chips and the blue cheese sauce is glorified salad dressing. After two bites you are done.....and regrettably have added $10 to your bill. Ordered their pork belly BLT, bread was stale and too thick to even bite and the pork belly wasn't crisp, felt like you were eating strips of jiggly fat. Gross. On a brighter note, my dirty martini was delicious.  Would not go here again or recommend, so many better places to eat in MGM, don't waste your $$$ on a crappy restaurant with a famous name."
0,This was my second visit to this location. I received a lot of food for my money but the food is just okay... I love Mexican food and this place is just cranking it out without any real quality. The service was fine and I did not think it took long to wait for my food. I'm passing on this one.
0,"Horrible service and my food was cold. If they had been busy, I MIGHT understand, seeing as I used to be a server myself. But we were the only people in the place. And considering that I've had such great experiences at other King's locations, I was very disappointed."

0,"If I could give zero stars I would. I know that may be harsh, and I don't mean to offend anyone but this place seriously needs a visit from the health dept. The food here is mediocre at best and the best food here is the processed foods. The Mongolian cook never cleared the grill between meals and didn't cook them anywhere near in order. I saw him pick food out of the trap and put it on the dish that he served to a customer! After I saw that, I knew I had better stay away from the sushi, right next to the Mongolian grill. It didn't appear that he was even remotely trying to cook the food in any kind of order.  I was first in a line of 6 people who brought their food to him to cook, but I received my food last. LAST. The place is dark and dingy and looked mid-evil, it doesn't look like the place had been DEEP cleaned since this place was a steak house...but the last straw was when I went to use the men's room (which I had to do before I left the place considering what I had just eaten here) the only lights in the men's room were above the sinks, the toilets were in a separate area...and they were lit by BLACK lights...! Is this a reference to the food you consume here???"
1,"A large pizza is definitely big enough to share for 2.I think it has something to do with the density if the base.. Even though it is a thin and crispy base.. It tastes like it is thick and dense.. It's just really filling! And although it was burnt and oily it was still so so tasty.. We got ours with pepperoni, mushroom and onion and the tomato based sauce they use is yummo.. We'll be back!"

1,This is a solid tap room. Great waitstaff. Solid food choices. It is tough not to like this place. The beer choices are outstanding.

0,"Okay so this review is only for the side that sells the Gelato, drinks and candy..not the restaurant.\n\nSo I really don't get why this place is so popular....well besides the fact that it's endorsed and advertised by celebrities...it's basically a very super overpriced candy store. I don't want to offend anyone but really....lollipops with freakin bling on the stick for 20-25 dollars for one!? who in the right mind would buy a lollipop for 20 dollars!! and about 70 dollars for like three! besides that,  most of the other candy looks like they bought a bulk of candy  from costco or something and simply placed it in their own dispensers and are selling it for about 4-5 dollars a pound. It's like your regular sour heads, jelly bellies, sour gummies, gummies, etc etc etc \n\nI totally don't see anything special about this place...the only reason I was in here was for the gelato...now I was craving for ice cream/gelato - just something cold and sweet on 104 degree day and this was the closest place we were at that had gelato so decided to stop in here for a scoop. I ordered the lemon sorbet and surprisingly for about $4 they gave two generous scoops. It was just okay. Once again not quite sure why people would spend so much on regular candy....or the bling bling lollipop....but I can't judge the other side of this place since I didn't sit down for a meal at their restaurant...perhaps next time. \n\nHowever with all this said I guess I give them credit for attempting and not to mention succeeding to make a regular candy store more fancy than other candy stores at a mall....well i guess they are fancier than a candy store at the mall because they do have other desserts and pastries....like macaroons and cupcakes. However fancy mancy this place is....it's really just overpriced mediocre treats to me that are hyped up by celebrities and I am just not one to be so gullible  as to buy a 25 dollar lollipop. It's amazing what people would buy just because celebrities are eating it."

0,"I actually tend to really like Harrah's casinos. This one, however, not so much. The one in AC is so much better, which is ironic since AC is a dirty version of Vegas. \n\nMy opinion may be swayed by the issue we had upon arrival. Having flown in from Philly and arriving early (11am) I did anticipate an issue checking in early. They offered to let us check in for a $25 early check in fee per room (2 rooms on our reservation). We opted to get into only one room early- so we could at least have our luggage in the same space. The lady checking us in said to call at 2pm to see if the room was ready- it would be ready earliest at 2pm latest at 4pm. 4pm rolls around and they tell us \""Check is is between 4pm and 6pm\"" and that the room still isn't ready. How is this even possible? We ask for the $25 back since the second room on our reservation still isn't available, and we were told it would be. They proceed to say they never told us that. Once again I feel I need to travel with a tape recorder on me at all times. In the end, after spending 40 minutes at the check in counter, both rooms were available and I had my $25 back. In all honesty, I'd prefer my 40 minutes back. It was so unnecessary, and tiring. It just really left a bad taste in my mouth- I can't handle poor attitudes and everyone we dealt with that day had one. I found this to be strange, since I've rarely encountered such cranky people in Vegas. I think it has something to do with the Oxygen they pump - perhaps the tanks were empty that day. \n\nIn addition, the casino is OK, just OK, nothing wonderful. The bar options aren't that appealing, and the food options even less appealing."
0,"Great creative food\nExperience is spoiled by dreadful staff.  \nHostess are disengaged ( either texting on iPhone) or otherwise ignoring customers.  \n\nTold us wrong information regarding roof top.

Of course \""those two tables\"" were occupied.. \nIndicated the two top we occupied were for folks wanting to dine... I informed we wanted supper.

U need to move.\""  That we were welcome to sit outside on the front terrace.  She led us down to front -- gave us menus-  and left.  \nWe said there for at least 10 minutes.   I could see a bevy of staff lingering /chatting at the front hostess  podium just inside the door.  I got back up. Asked if the front area was self serve ( order from bar-- take your own food out) or if there was a server coming.  Few minutes later a server arrived.  We placed order.  As did others outside waiting.  \n\nEither the staff has no way of marking what tables are what.  Every time new food came out to terrace the runners stopped at every table ( Including folks already eating). With plates of food.

1,"Cherry Bar... \n\nDon't be swayed by the name... Its a man's bar....  no, no stripper pole!  I wasn't sure what to expect, when I walked in, but when I was greeted by the familiar face of Tom, the bartender ( His abilities are legendary from Padlock and Friends) I knew I was gonna be quite happy! \n\nPrior to being baptized \""Cherry Bar\"" ... the place was most recently named \""Friends\""... it had a great staff and location, but lacked an identity. I understand that changes are underway, and a lot can be expected in the future from the new owners, including a completed outdoor patio area and interior remodel. Personally, I'm happy to see their Men's bathroom is modern, clean and well lit. ( unlike another nameless bar on 7th Street just North of Missouri ..YUK !!!) \n\nThey also have some awesome drink specials going on.. I was there on a Thursday night... and it was 2-4-1... other specials are Mojito Mondays $4.00 until 11...with karaoke starting at 9! and $5.00 well Martinis on Wednesday! And Every night is 2-4-1 from 11PM until close! \n\nSo... I'll be here often...... it has a lot of potential... and besides... If you ask... Tom will shake the hell out of your martini the way it should be... frosty cold!"

O-ver-rated.\n\nUndeserving of accolades, superficially interesting, won't stand the test of time, all sizzle - no steak.\n\nI mean, what can one expect from a corny chain, where one is overwhelmed by Disney-fied cake and ale?  This place couldn't be less lame if they renamed it Chotchkie's and served Extreme Fajitas.  Actually, I'm shocked that they don't.\n\nOkay, okay.  I like beer.  They've got it.  But where is their sincerity?  They couldn't give a squirt of piss that they are serving rare Belgian pilsner.  I'm supposed to feel okay about this?  I need authenticity when I'm at a bar.  This is why so many Ultras in Scottsdale or LA or wherever fail with me, the dearth of convincing clientele, staff, and moreover, product.  Don't shit on my pillow and tell me its a little piece of chocolate.\n\nOverall, this is a genuine 1-star rating ... not one of those mealy-mouthed \""oh, i wanted to give it LESS but I couldn't!\"" reviews.

I had no idea how bad traffic on the strip was, we needed to add an hour to see everything which wasn't a problem. \n\nI didn't have time to research limo services before Vegas and just saw their ad in a magazine in our hotel.

Of course, my excitement started to subside at the parking lot, and then immediately flew out the door when I stepped into the lobby. I don't know how long this place has been standing, but, I'm guessing a while, as everything looked old and felt kind of creepy. Dim lighting, a concession stand where I probably wouldn't order anything from (not just because prices are astronomical compared to the ticket prices), etc., etc. At this point, I was feeling okay; however, upon entering the actual theater, I started to feel more uneasy. I don't know if it was the dirty seats, some of the people, the trash or the general atmosphere, but I didn't like it. I also didn't like how some people were talking and yelling throughout the movie (If I wanted commentary, I would have stayed home with friends and watched a movie.). Add to all this, the fact that the movie was WEIRD really affected my ability to enjoy this theater. I think my friends noticed my discomfort at the whole situation, as they pointed and laughed at me (in a loving way, of course) throughout the entire movie.  \n\nI don't have other dollar theaters to compare this one to, but, if I did, maybe I could give this place a less biased rating. The two stars are for movie selection (they offer recent movies, although limited) and price. Other than that (and friends), I don't think I'll be visiting this place anytime soon."
0,"Don't waste your time. First, we went to their store to look at countertops with interest in having cabinets done also. One person was there, Josh who didn't know much. Based on dimensions I provided, the price for the counters would be $2,500 according to him. The owner John Joshes dad, came to my mom's house and told us his kid was wrong and he would give us the quote for the entire job in a few days. Thirty minutes after he left, I had a question and called, but only could leave a message. I called again in a couple more hours and could only leave a message again. That was three weeks ago and he hasn't called back. To me, that's rude and not good business."
1,"I have found another sub place that I will now frequent besides Subway and Cappriotti's. They all have their unique flavors and different selection. I think Subway as a chain is good for the value, Cappriottis has their distinct sandwiches, and now Jersey Mike's - definitely high quality meats and just good sandwiches. I am a fan of many of their sandwiches including the club, the original italian and some of their hot subs including the cheesesteak. You can get it Mike's way which is how they were intended and also make sure you get the hot chili spread to spice up your sandwich."
0,This place kind of sucks. The waitress was super nice but the food is awful and the drinks are very overpriced. I'm happy we went because I was always curious about the place but we definitely won't be returning.
0,"I've been to Sundance many times. I try to stay on the lookout for the non-blockbuster movies and Sundance is, of course, the only option in Madison. I wish they played fewer big releases. Until recently I had enjoyed the 2 for 1 student tickets on Tuesdays. I've been surprised in the past to find that certain movies don't qualify for the discount, so I recently tried to figure out if the 2 for 1 deal was available for a particular movie. I looked on the website, but the website is void of any information other than movie times. I tried calling the theatre just to check, but the automated answering system sent me right to voicemail. This was early on a Tuesday, so I can't imagine the place being that busy. With a little time before showtime, I headed to the theatre and of course saw a sign saying that Sundance no longer offers the 2 for 1 student tickets, but will give matinee pricing all day on Tuesdays for students. Okay, they changed the discount and that's fine, but why can't they put that on their website? or answer the phone? I know I'm complaining about a discount, but I think it shows a general lack of customer service. I also agree with several other reviewers on the condition of the bathrooms, which have never been great. One last thing. . . have an usher take tickets. I've been to Sundance a couple dozen times and I can only remember an usher taking tickets ONCE. It's part of the movie going experience that is sorely missing at Sundance."
1,"I personally never had a bad experience at all with this location. Staff is kind, and gets my drinks right. It's busy depending on the time of the day, so usually when the students comes out from school that's when there is a long line, but they get my drinks out in a timely matter. \nI haven't been here in a year and they changed a lot, their drink sizes are now \""small medium and large\"" with an option of a kid's size as well. Back then it wasn't offered and the sizes were like \""sixteen - blah blah\"". The cups are now a hard cardboard like material instead of the styrofoam they had in the past. I don't mind the changes, I like it now because the styrofoam had a better chance of getting a hole poked in it. \n\nI just wish I knew someone who was holding a fundraiser because I would always buy one or two of the \""Bogo\"" cards for $10. That's a steal right there! \n\nLocation is perfect, I can get my lunch and shopping and juice all in the same place (I'm a chipotle fan). \n\nFavorite drink is Orange Dream Machine, and if you sign up to be a jamba insider you get $3 off your next purchase! Nice! \n\nOverall good drinks and good customer service."
0,"I loved this place, we get groupons and go.  The last time we went they changed the menu , downsized the portions.  Not worth the drive from Gilbert."
1,Great food. Excellent beers on tap. What more could you want in life? I've been here quite the number of times and always had something new and delicious to try.
1,good Italian place... the menu has some unique things and they do a good job... it is pretty expensive but for specials occasions it is good.  Zac is right about the accents... but it adds to the flavor and the pesto butter is pretty good as well...
0,"Planned to go there last Sunday because of all the great things we had heard about this place!  WELL, to our surprise, they were not open!!!  the huge NOW OPEN sign was hanging in the window, the hours on the door said they were open -- there were a few people inside, looked like they were cleaning the kitchen area or something........ but alas, all the doors were locked and the people inside completely ignored us!!  At least take down the huge NOW OPEN banner in the window!!!  Or post a sign on the door explaining why you would be locked up during your business hours!!!"
0,"My friend and I first came here in August before seeing The Strokes at The Chealsea and we loved our meal so much we decided to come back this week before going to see Imagine Dragons at The Joint over at the Hard Rock. During our first visit I ordered the Turkey sliders and an Oreo shake so of course it was delicious, can't go wrong with a classic meal. However during this visit, I was highly disappointed in the price we paid for our meal. For this round I ordered the Turkey burger because I hadn't eaten at all that day and more for the fact I wanted to try something different, I also ordered the Pecan Cheesecake shake off the menu to try something new. When the shake came, sure it tasted delicious for the first minute but then I realized it wasn't a shake, just a bunch of milk as the taste of pecan and cheesecake disappeared by each sip and more and more milk & whip cream came to taste even after dumping it in the silver cup of seconds. I had wished I got the oreo shake but it was too late. While waiting for our burgers I decided to start munching on the complimentary seasoned popcorn which was so delicious that when they messed up and put the goat chedder cheese on my burger instead of the regular cheedar cheese, I filled myself up with popcorn, that \""milkshake\"" and water so by the time my fresh better tasting burger came out, I was full and didn't even want it anymore. Maybe this review will get 4 or 5 starts on my third visit however right now I can only give 1 star to the waitress who provided excellent customer service and 1 star to the free popcorn. At least I know next time just to stick with the same old turkey SLIDERS and oreo shake....hopefully they still taste good."
0,"Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time. I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. They \""fixed\"" it for free, and the very next morning I had the same issue. I called to complain, and the \""manager\"" didn't even apologize!!! So frustrated. Never going back.  They seem overpriced, too."
0,"Pizza and salads are pretty good.\nReason I gave them 2 stars is because the manager/owner is very condescending and rude.\n\nI could write a lengthy review but I feel like nobody would read it. First went when they first opened and went a few times after because it's right by my work and I was excited that we got a restaurant in AZ that is similar to Pieology. \n\nI could go on about the manager/owner but the thing that irked me the most was when I was listing the veggies I wanted on my pizza, I got to about 7 toppings, and he goes \""Whoa the limit is 5\"". I quickly apologized and in a very condescending way he says, \""Uhh I'll let it slide this time.\"" I thanked him but while still in line I also saw him picking toppings off another customer's pizza and angrily tossing them out because apparently they picked too many toppings too. Shortly after I realized he wasn't doing me a favor. He micro manages like crazy, you can tell he's all about cost management first and hospitality second. The funny thing is nowhere in the RESTAURANT OR MENU does it say 5 TOPPING LIMIT. \nI hope the management changes or the guy comes to his senses that he's making his employees and customers uncomfortable because frankly the food is more than decent and not super expensive and more importantly it's right by my office. This guy hasn't just turned me off from the restaurant but a handful of my co-workers as well."
0,"Hello I stayed at Rumor last night and the a/c was not working in our room.  Our phone did not have a tone only when you put in on speaker.  I called down stairs they asked me if I wanted someone to fix that I said I would call them if I did but first I wanted to try to fix the phone myself in case they was something unplugged.  Then they send someone to the room when I was in the bath.  I told him not to come and he had an attitude when I asked him to come back later.  There were people smoking weed outside so we could not open our window, this made it a horrible night.  I told the staff lady Emily that we were going out and to have someone fix the a/c but no one did.\n\nSo we rode it out that night and in the morning I went to check out and I told Jessica that the a/c still was not working and she did not even say sorry or anything that would comfort me.  All she said was that she would send someone to fix it, yeah right.\n\nThe only good thing about this place was that the the room looked nice."
0,"the store is ok. selection is decent if compared to online. staff is decent, not the most competent but better than some other places.\n\nthey used to have a gaming section but it was way too expensive. they now have clothing but quality wise, its a crapshoot with walmart but at a premium price.\n\ntheir movie selection is bad with ridiculous prices. on seldom sale, it does hot but outside of those times, better look somewhere else.\n\ntheir boxing day sales.. probably the biggest joke out there as they limit the offered quantity. once they run out of the allocated number, you'll pay regular price on the item you thought would be cheap.. buyer's beware\n\ntheir website, pretty useless and in 2014, still can't buy online. you can reserve but you know, convenience and with so few stores in town.."
1,"Beautiful, clean, quiet, heavenly.  What more could you ask for after a night of debauchery in Las Vegas?!  I spent 2 afternoons at the Spa.  Got a wonderful 25-minute aromatherapy massage from Jackie on the first day.  When it was over I regretted not booking a 50-minute session.  Got a body scrub and body wrap from Kathy  the following day.  Very relaxing, but felt a bit rushed.  However, just having all-day access to the spa facility made it all better.  \n\nSpent a good 2 hours just lounging by the spa pools.  There's just something so soothing about the sound of fountains that puts me right to sleep. \n\nExpensive, but well worth it."
0,"I have been to other Ah-so and have loved them, but i would not recommend this Ah-so. I've tried this place a few times now and have been disappointed every time. Sushi was horrible and very inconsistent. I have ordered multiple rolls on each occasion and each roll tasted funny or was poorly made. I could barely pick up the roll with out it falling apart. Service has been horrible. I won't be coming back to this Ah-so."
0,"Sitting in Mizuya as i write this review. Been here about 45 minutes now. I can't tell you anything about the food, because we haven't received any yet. Hopefully they feed me before I finish this review...nope, they still haven't.\n\nUpdate: After an hour of waiting, a manager of another restaurant came over, apologized on Mizuya's behalf, and then moved us to his restaurant."
0,Went here for a friends birthday. Sounded like a cool and interesting place. They had live music (the chick sang really really nicely) wasnt too crowed.\n\nThe scene Is hipster=no bueno\n\nCocktails were mediocre at best. I ordered an old fashion that came out tasting like a nigroni. \n\nThe next cocktail was the boulevard(ier). Tasted like an old fashion with chocolate bitters...meh\n\nIll check it out when the cocktail program has been revamped
1,"CPK not CKY\nBy The Rue\n\nWent to lunch at the CPK,\nAt first I thought it was gonna be gay,\nMy friend convinced me, said \""no way\"",\nTheir chef's think they're Bobby Flay.\n\nAppetizer was avacado egg rolls,\nNo, I didn't draft Darren Sproles,\nThey came on a plate, not in bowls,\nWhen I shoot I score goals!\n\nLunch was a pizza with pear and gorgozola,\nIt was amazing down to my soul-a,\nIn Telluride I take the gondola,\nOnly hippies and health nuts eat granola.\n\nThe ice tea was fantastic,\nIt made my body spastic,\nThe food doesn't taste like plastic,\nMake sure you're wearing elastic. \n\nTemecula!!"
0,"I was meeting my fiance who had already been in Vegas for work. He was staying at the MGM which I was thankful for cause it's really not a bad hotel, but that's for another review.\n\nAs I entered our room, on the desk was a cutely packaged cupcake. It was a salted caramel with the mgm logo drawn on a piece of chocolate.  \n\nI excitedly opened the package and dug my fork from top to bottom. Then I ate each layer separately. The frosting was super sweet. If you had closed your eyes and tried it, you wouldn't be able to distinguish the caramel at all. It was just sugar. It was filled with actual caramel though. The cake itself was not too sweet but it was sadly super dry.  \n\nOverall, his gesture was super sweet and I thanked him in every way possible but I was left unimpressed."
0,"Luxor has seen it's age and the management as not seen it in their plans to maintain or upgrade the entire facility.\n\nAbout the only advisement I can give people is to upgrade your room as much as you an afford because the regular deluxe rooms are beat up and worn.\n\nThe facility has need of a lot of fixing and upgrading but you won't find that being done.  Carpets where you find them are skanky and feel tacky. The shape of the building is why you are probably there to say you stayed.  The next door neighbor, Mandalay Bay, unless you really get into the new tower and upgrade will disappoint you as well.\n\nFood?  Even the best dining experience will be like eating portions served from the Buffet line with extra spices laced with better grade of brandy in the sauces.\n\nWhat makes me such an expert?  I have been escorting Asian gamblers to Las Vegas for years.  I started by accident back when the Mint was still operating.  Yes.  That's a long time.  I have stayed in some of the best hotels and got to know what is what.  I have slowed down my visits to escort whales because I do have a regular professional career that I went 7 years of university studies to be outstanding in. \n\nWhat I have noticed recently is the downward spiral of Las Vegas grandeur.  The service, facilities, the glamour is gone.  I went to Singapore and Macau and they have it.  I want the Las Vegas of 20 years ago back!\n\nWe should all demand that management get their acts together because the choices how we spend our money for gaming, rooms and entertainment are votes whether they are successful or not.\n\nJust my humble opinion.\n\nLuxor?  You can do better do your research.  Try staying at the newer hotels with good ratings."
1,"What an amazing place for dinner. The ambience & service is outstanding.  Francesco was our server. We started with a glass of Pinot then a Caesar salad bread & butter. Our filet was cooked perfectly with the au gratin potatoes as well as the asparagus. (Order the  beranasie sauce) before dessert they brought out lime cello to cleanse our palate. Dessert was the table side banana foster, well worth it. This is a great place for a nice dinner or a special occasion."
1,"32 ounces of icee alcohol for only $12 and you get a free funny looking funnel cup.\n\nLots of flavors and colors to choose from.\n\nAfter one of these, you're ready to have fun shopping.\n\nLine can get long at times."
1,"What can I say? I confess. I like Taco Bell. Usually not a Yelp check-in worthy event though. Definitely not review worthy. Except tonight. \n\nThe workers on this visit were simply awesome. How often can you say that about a fast food restaurant? I eat at this Taco Bell fairly often, usually just running in for the quick and cheap $2.99 meal deal (a best buy, hard to find on the menu board), motivated by a dining room that is really nice compared to most Taco Bells.\n\nOn this night I was accompanied by extended family. Two unexpected things happened. First, I was offered an unexpected discount. Nice! Second, we were given some free cinnamon twists, prompted I think by the cute kids we had in tow. Even nicer! \n\nA great family outing at Taco Bell! Who knew? I was only expecting quick and cheap, but received much more."
1,"Stopped here the day before my birthday to get my coworkers a treat. The doughnuts were fresh, the service was fast, and the prices were ok. Not cheap, but definitely ok. Where this place shines is in the creativity. The only one I remember in particular was the Fat Elvis, and that alone will keep me coming back for more. All of my coworkers were desperate to know where I got the doughnuts. If you're on this side of town, it's a must try.\n\nEdit: Now open 24 hours."
0,"Vision Express is a chain opticians operating in pretty much every town center. You would imagine they are all the same but the customer service in this branch is beyond disappointing.\n\nI had my eyes tested in Vision Express in Perth and was given a prescription. Due to my poor student status, the nice lady gave me a form to fill out to receive a NHS discount. For that reason I couldn't pick my glasses that day, but the optician told me it would be fine for me to fill my prescription at any Vision Express branch.\n\nSo once I received my money off coupon I toddled on down to Vision Express in the St James Centre. Well according to the rather scary woman behind the counter there was no way in hell I could fill my prescription at any other store and it had to be the store I had my eyes tested in. We argued back and forth for a good 20 minutes before she turned me away. Poor show, you don't want my money? FINE. I will take it elsewhere. Thanks for the inconvenience. \n\nFunny how apparently I could only get my glasses at the one Vision Express branch where I had my eyes tested yet Tesco's opticians were happy enough to sell me some. \n\nNext time I won't use Vision Express."
1,The food is really good.  Choice of rice I really like.  Prices are even more attractive.  Customer service is right on point.  Lot of kids work here but they are a cut above the usual young employees you find elsewhere.  These are well trained and polite and quick
1,"I go out of my way to stop by Rainbow Donuts every time I'm on the west side of town. The doughnuts are excellent and the owners are very, very nice people.\n\nHighly recommended!"
0,"I gave this place a try with a couple friends/my boss & co-worker.  Not my typical nail place but it was for a pedicure so why not give them a try.\n\nI've heard ppl rave about this place, read about it in the \""best of\"" for Charlotte, which has now left me very confused...apparently I missed something because nothing about my pedicure should be placed in \""best of...\""\n\nFor starters, my water was cold and even though I told her numerous times that the water was cold and freezing me, the temperature never changed.  I've had many pedicures in my lil lifetime so I know the whole procedure...mine consisted of sitting my feet in cold water, the nail tech removing my current polish,  clipping a few cuticles (not all), applying lotion, and painting my toes.  \n\nNow normally I would expect a pedicure to included warm water for soaking your feet, clipping of the nails and cutting back all the cuticles, using the exfoliator thing on the bottom of the feet, oils, lotions, polish, and some other random stuff I don't know the technical terms for (Atleast that's what every pedicure in my past has involved)\n\nAlso----the color options here were very plain and boring.  I'm very thankful I thought to bring my own polish.\n\nThe staff didn't talk much they seemed nice and they did offer us wine and other drink options which was nice.\n\nBasically I don't see me returning,"
1,"Visiting NC from South Florida, which is closer to NY on the culinary map than the Deep South, we were craving some down-home style southern food. FBC did not disappoint! Straight from the airport, my bro-in-law brought us to The Flying Biscuit.  Fried green tomatoes to start with an Espresso Stout (Guinness + espresso shot) on the side, delicious!  Then the Cajun Chicken omelet with a dash of the Texas Pete hot sauce--phenomenal! Biscuit was great (of course) but did not fly well ;)\nFriendly service, fantastic food! Next time we're in Charlotte, we'll be back!"
1,While the red velvet cupcakes may be mini (and good for my portion-challenged self) they couldn't be more delish!! The half asparagus and havarti panini and half harvest salad were an equally flavorful lunch option. But desserts clearly steal my heart away.
1,Had a great time with Maverick Tours this morning.  Was my first time on a helicopter and the staff was great providing safety training before the flight.  Our pilot Joe led us on a smooth ride all the way to the Grand canyon and back.  He provided information during the flight to add to the enjoyment of seeing the sites from high above.  Once we landed in the Canyon we sipped champagne and had many photo ops.  Lots of room in the helicopter too.  Thank you to the great staff at Maverick for a once in a lifetime adventure!
0,So... where do I start?\n\nCame here 2 nights ago... with a bunch of guys of course.\nThey all had beers... me on the other hand... well I don't drink... which leads to me to review on the food and service.\n\nI ordered one of their wraps... it took over 30 mins to arrive after placing my order. Why did it take that long to get to me? My friends said they messed up on my order... oh and the worst part after the long wait... It didn't have any flavor and the taste was horrible! I had wedges with my wrap... and that was decent. \n\nI suggest only coming here if you're a guy looking for a casual sports bar to have drinks with friends... and don't order any of the food items. My other friend ordered a chicken sandwich and it looked really scary... he didn't want to eat it but he was really hungry.  My other friend ordered the nachos... from my view... it looked really cheap and horrible. No good quality here when it comes to food.\n\nParking wasn't a problem. Seating wasn't a problem. Very casual. \n\nI would never be caught in a BWW again... first and last visit for me. Can't believe I spent 2 hours in here. yuck.\n\nNEXT.
0,"Horrible! Our waiter switched when we sat down, and a new one came up and said \""I got you guys b/c I get all the pretty ladies\"" barf. We ordered before our drinks even came, service was not good. Food was ok, but not worth the ridiculous prices even at brunch."
1,"This is a great spot for Korean food. This was my first time visiting and I would definitely visit again based on my experience. Food was very reasonably priced considering the size of the portions that were given. Be sure to check their daily specials!\n\nI don't understand all of the 3 star or less reviews. They seem to be just very picky people and maybe it wasn't up to their \""standards,\""  but before you go believing their nonsense, give this place a try. The food was delicious, got it within 10 minutes (remember that speed doesn't always equal satisfaction. They cook the food fresh per order; expect about a 10-15 minute wait) and the staff was very nice. Will come here again!"
1,"Super tasty!  The Naan itself is worth a trip to this place for lunch or dinner.  The rolls are super filling and now they come with these awesome tempura fries!  If you choose rice instead of naan to accompany the entrees, the portion is rice is HUGE so be prepared.  Lunch gets busy and this place is kind of small so it's sometimes hard to find a seat.  And when it's crowded, it can be a little confusing for the server to find your table to deliver food to you, as someone else said, the system for order delivery is not exactly the most effective.  But the tasty tandoor-made breads makes up for it!"

I told Lyn I am cooking dinner for a new guy im seeing...it's our 3rd date and im nervous to cook in his home cause I wanna be uber neat but delicious.

0,"I had great costumer service with the girl behind the counter, however the manager was HORRIBLE! Maybe he was having a bad day but he didn't even look at my face when I asked to substitute an ingredient he just said: NO! I just wanted slices of avocado instead of cheese (I am allergic to dairy) - yeah, I wasn't asking for much here!!! The girl even thought he was talking to himself or something and she asked him again and he said another NO! He said I had to pay for it (which I gladly did cause I don't mind paying .50c) but he kept looking over the girl's shoulder to make sure she charged me. Then, asked her again: did you charge her for the avocado???\n\nOMG!!! I don't mind paying!!! He treated me as if I were stealing avocados and he treated the girl as if she was going to (God forbid) forget to charge me .50c\n\nHorrible for a chain to have a manager like that! I felt so bad that I decided to walk back to the hotel to eat there instead of eating in the restaurant."
0,"We ordered pizza last night from here, we got a large which looked a little small, more like a medium and was about $20+ after delivery, tip, etc and it was gone super quick! \n\nI found it overpriced, the pizza was ok, I think dominoes for $5.99 and new recipe is a better deal! \n\nAnd it took almost an hour to get to us! Not Impressed!"
1,"Wow.  The food is DIVINE.  I haven't experienced flavors that intense in years.  I would've given it 5 stars, except the atmosphere is way too stuffy for me.  Really expensive great food doesn't mean it can't have a more fun atmosphere..."
0,"Negative stars need to exist for establishments like this.\n\nI have contacted the better business bureau about this location, as well as their corporate offices. Alerted them to their accusing us of walking out on our checks when we did not, then charging our card the wrong amount. All this after a four hour miserable wait and experience. I have also reported the manager Dan who has handled this so atrociously that it's astounding he has a job at all. \n\nPlease: do not eat here or support this business. I venture to guess they will be closed soon anyway; especially after the business bureau begins investigating them."
1,The Burger Bar had slipped a bit over the last couple of year but this year they've rebounded considerably. I ate there twice this trip and both times the burgers were outstanding as were the fat fries. (skip the skinny fries - they tend to come out cold). I still wish they offered brown or deli mustard along with the plethora of other dipping goodies.\n\nI have to knock off 1.5 stars for the table service which is indifferent at best. The best bet for service is sit at the bar.
1,"Totally enjoyed my experience with Craig at Uptown Retreat.  All of the staff were very friendly and eager to help.  My friend and I were both in from out of town and scheduled two blow outs and one cut.  Craig was my stylist and Davis did my friends hair.  Both guys did an excellent job!  Craig you 'get it'....hair length, face shape, hair cut, and most importantly the blow out and style!  Not many stylists can bring it all together like you did! Thank you..now will you please come to my town!?!?  Oh...and I loved the corner location of your chair....had an awesome view while getting my hair did! :-)"

1,"My wife and I went to check Full House bbq and we were not disappointed. The place is very clean and well organized. The service is very friendly. We ordered Surf and Turf and Kare Kare never knowing what to expect. To my surprise,  I ate it all. That's how good it was. The chef came out and introduced himself and found out he was a chef at Mandalay Bay Hotel. That explains the flavourful food and the excellent presentation of our food. My wife had to order more to go and ordered the siopao and palabok. Excellent choice. I was told that the boddle boat is good but it is serve for 4 people. We will try it next time. I need to try some more in the menu to give it a 5      but our overall experience is great with very reasonable price."
0,"The place is nice and the customer service is pretty good. \n\nI expected a lot more from the food. I got an original stash  burger. The buns taste just like store bought buns and they get soggy with everything they put in them. The beef patty was dry and had no flavor. I ended up leaving most of the soggy buns and eating everything else. The fries are pretty good though. I expected a lot more, especially from a $15+ burguer. \n\nEver heard of GBurger down on socal? Now those are good burgers and for $15 you get a huge one that tastes 10+ times better"
1,"Firefly is simply the best near-strip restaurant.  The only downside: a lot of people now know this, and the relatively small restaurant is now pretty much always packed (and I believe they do not take reservations).  However, the food and service is well worth the wait (or the risk of a wait).\n\nThe menu is HUGE and is constantly being changed and added to, and I've yet to try something that I didn't like.  I few suggestions that I enjoy: the bacon wrapped stuffed dates are a must try, along with the ham & cheese croquetas.  The firefly fries are amazing, and big enough to share, as are the calamari.  Other suggestions include the Thai beef salad, the tuna tartar and shrimp ceviche, stuffed pepper, mac n cheese, baked talapia, and the mergeuz.  Don't fill up on the entrees too much, because the tres leches cake is probably the best thing on the menu, so save room for dessert.  \n\nFirefly is also known for its selections of sangria, infused vodkas (vodka + fresh squeezed juices), and mojitos, all of which are great - my favorites are the infused vodka on the rocks, and the passion fruit and blood orange mojitos.  \n\nGo here with a small group and order in small batches, I'd suggest 2 plates per person, per batch.  The food comes out very quick and the table can get very cluttered, very fast.  Most of the dishes here are fairly cheap, but it is very easy to go overboard and run up a large bill, especially if it's you're first visit.\n\nEven though I hate how crowded this place has become, the food is well worth the short trip off the strip, and is a must try for anyone who hasn't tried this gem yet."
0,"The male scans over the females on the dancefloor looking for his perfect mate.\r\n\r\nHis eyes lock onto his target.  He approaches his potential mate cautiously.  Casually, he walks toward her general area and begins his mating dance.  He dangles his lanky arms and legs, writhing to a rhythm found not in the top 40 hits being played, but only in his head....and in his heart.  He draws nearer but makes no move to communicate verbally to his love.  He is certain that she (as his true love) can SENSE and FEEL the MUTUAL connection they have.\r\n\r\nThe window of opportunity is open and the male jumps through it!  He grabs the female around the waist, pulling her closer to him.  He wants to show her how \""manly\"" he truly is.  But wait! What's this?!  She pulls away from him, gives him a nasty look and stomps away to the protection of the other females.  Dejected, the male slinks away into the dark shadows from which he came.\r\n\r\nThe male scans over the females on the dancefloor, looking for his *next* perfect mate.\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nYeah, I got to see that scene replayed god knows how many times at RumJungle.  Seriously, it's like those nature documentaries that I like to watch with my pops on the Discovery Channel.\r\n\r\n2 stars for providing me with amusement."
1,"My mom and I decided to eat at the Steakhouse 46.\n\nThis place may not be the new trendy hot spot for steaks and seafood but seriously, who needs it if the food sucks.  At Steakhouse 46, the food is delicious and the service is awesome.  We told our server before hand that we needed to go to a concert at a certain time and to make sure if we could be served quicker than normal.  To our surprise they delivered on their word.  Our food was served promptly and it was delicious.\n\nMy mom ordered the Chilean sea-bass. It was served with rice and a nice sauce complimented the fish very well.  It was tasty and tender.  And I ordered the lobster and filet Mignon.  My lobster was steamed nicely and my meat cooked perfectly, medium.  Overall we were satisfied and will definitely eat here again."
1,"As an avid coffee fan, I have to say that Caribou has won me over. They have free Wi-Fi, which is great if you find yourself in the area and you need to do some work via computer. When you walk in the door, you feel like you've left the Southside and entered a cozy ski lodge. They even have a fireplace surrounded by big, comfy chairs -definitely a plus when you're looking for a place to relax and sip on some espresso. \n\nOne of the cool things about Caribou is that it has a wider variety of menu items than your typical coffee shop. The oatmeal (try their Blueberry Almond flavor, so good!), breakfast sandwiches and snacks are much better than what you can get at your local Starbucks. If you're not a coffee person, Caribou also has some really good flavored teas. Overall, a great place to get your caffeine fix."
0,"I went here today with my mom and my two kids. We ordered a sandwich and a salad and a drink and 2cookies.  I brought my kids meals since one is gluten free and one barely eats and didn't want to waste money on them.  We were done with our meal when i took my boys to the bathroom and saw that they have free kids meals on weekends when adults purchase meals! Wtf would they have the sign in the bathroom!! I could have got my kids meals all along!  The guy even charged us for the 2cookies when i could have got 2meals a drink and cookies for free!! It would have been nice for him to say when ordering hey kids meals are free today..i even had 2other adults join us so we had 4adult meals and not once did he say kids eat free..very disappointed..i just gave my kids water that i brought,they could have had juice or something else..not good service..when i was going to say something when we were leaving he was nowhere to be found.."
0,"Worst customer service on multiple occasions - whether it be trying to demo a racquet or try out some shoes, you can be ignored in whole or in part for quite some time.  A lot of teens and early 20 something kids work here, and it shows.  Yet another place that bothers you with a stupid reward program that rarely yields a substantial benefit.\n\nLocation is in the SW part of the shopping area close to I-17, adjacent to where Circuit City used to be."

1,I really enjoyed valentines day weekend here ! It's a wonderful romantic getaway if you want quite weekend and quality time with your loved one. We ate dinner at 2 restaurants in the village the Mexican resturant and luna Rossa both were awesome! I would have given 5 out of 5 stars but the service in restaurant for breakfast was no very good at all and the front desk when I booked spent 15 min explaining the different package options and I selected the special valentine package which included breakfast come to find out we didn't get package which we found out at breakfast and when going to front desk to ask for it to be fixed they simply said it was to late. That was disappointing. On another note the spa services were excellent!
1,"i have eten at Sierra Bonita several times.  The food is ALWAYS consistent, and some of the best eating in Phoenix.  The atmosphere is amazing and service is always top notch.  SB has figured out how to be a great neighborhood restaurant with world class food.  The style is southwestern with Mexico City influences - truly amazing."
0,"This place isn't even worthy of one star. \n\nI bought a rug from Furniture World and within hours it was shedding like mad. I called and talked the manager, Gary, who said he would have no problem exchanging the rug but unfortunately, there weren't anymore in the correct size that interested me.  Gary said that at the end of month, there would be a huge inventory and in the meantime, roll up the shedding one so it didn't get damaged or worn. I dutifully rolled the rug and put it in a safe storage area and waited. I called at the end of the month and was given excuses about how the rugs weren't hung yet, Call back in a week. And I did but I got the same run around. \""Not hung.. Not the correct size..\"" Blah blah blah...\n\nI called 3 to 4 times a month for 6 months and kept getting the run around with lame excuses all the while having to listen to Gary talk about how he was an honest business man, calling me \""sweetheart\"" (chauvinistic much?) and how he promised to \""make things right by me\"". Of course he never did.  \n\nFinally, I took the rug to a consignment shop. $650.00 down the drain. \n\nIf you like shady business practices, pushy sales people with low quality rugs and furniture overseen by a cheesy, classic Las Vegas dope of a manager then this is your place otherwise STAY AWAY!!!!"
0,"We just had one of the worst and most frustrating dining experiences we've ever had. We had to hunt the totally inept waitress down for every single thing. It took us two hours to get served - some at the table served after all the others were done eating. We received cold food that was extremely mediocre and ridiculously overpriced ($8 hot chocolate - are you serious?). We went to the manager three times to no avail. At the end she \""took care\"" of us by removing one item from one couple's menu. There were eight of us."
0,"Quality food, unprofessional and unacceptable service.  Too many choices in Vegas to get treated poorly in any paying establishment."
1,"Hands down the best hamburger ever-the stuffed spicy burger. It was flavorful, cooked perfectly and melted in our mouths. The captain crunch shake and fried homemade pickles topped it off. Giving it four stars because the service was slow, the waitress pass"
1,"I was offered a free training session with Charlie Y. and was happy to accept, as you'll see he's very knowledgeable and accomplished with the more technical lifts if you catch him training in the gym.\n\nI'm currently in the best shape of my life, but have also been dealing with a (slowly) healing structural issue (likely caused by multiple factors) for over a year. He was able to point out some flaws with my posture and form that I wasn't aware of, helped improve my deadlift technique and showed me some exercises which both revealed and had an effect on some tightness issues I've been experiencing.\n\nI was pleasantly suprised with how the session truly felt complimentary. He was happy to help and extended an invitation for more (paid) sessions any time in the future with zero pressure. I intend to buy some sessions with him periodically. It's popular on the internet to dismiss trainers, but I think it's a wise investment to occasionally purchase the opinions of someone experienced and knowledgeable, particularly as one ages beyond the invincibility felt in their teens and twenties.\n\nAlso a shout out to Kyle who also knows his stuff and I've been able to consult for some brief advice without pressure. I'd recommend looking into him as well.\n\n\nAs for the gym itself, it's pretty much the same as in my 2012 review. It gets the job done, but has the issues and inefficiences one will experience when patronizing a large corporate chain. The staff largely tries their best."
1,"This is not the nicest movie theater in town, or even close to it. However, ticket prices are what keep me coming back ($ 4.75 for matinee, and $ 6.75 for evenings). \n\nThat's more like it! I spend enough of my hard money at these damn concession stands. For only fifty cents more, you can get our extra-large soda. Umm OK, so instead of $5.00, I pay $5.50? Get outta here... I'd rather sneak in my own drink -thanks. Not that I'd ever done that--No! \n\nThe theaters are smallish, with no specified handicapped seating available. On occasion, we take our friend to the movies who is in a wheelchair and it is sometimes difficult to maneuver around. Despite the small inconvenience, we manage to see movies here -almost every weekend. There is also a cool arcade toward the front of the movie theater -in case your three year old just can't sit still in the movie. \n\nWhen you have a family, saving money where you can is important. This movie theater allows us to still get out occasionally and do things together -without breaking the bank. However, if you are trying to impress your date, this is not the place for you."
1,"Ah, Bannermans... my favourite watering hole from my university days in the Auld Reekie.  The place where student woes go to die... apart from the money ones. ^^\n\nMany people will probably know Bannermans as a gig venue (wow, it's been a long time since I've been to a gig here), and anyone who has been on the ghost tours will have passed it by.  It tends to be one of those places that everyone has heard of, but often haven't gotten around to going to.  It's not big and exciting, but it is a nice and relaxing rock pub, the sort where you can sit and have a natter with your friends without worrying about being drowned out by music or other ambient noise.  The music is great, but not a dominant feature of the place.  Because it's off the main stretch, it's never crowded unless there's a gig on or you're there on a weekend evening.\n\nI have found myself coming here every time I've been through in Edinburgh of late.  It's not the cheapest of places to go - I know many cheaper - but if you're looking for a place to chill this is the place to be.\n\nGive it a go yourself, especially if you've had a hectic day in the capitol!"

Its a buffet with plenty of made to order options and orange juice is included. $16 gets you the traditional, savory and sweet choices - ammmmazing grits, some kind of extra special pineapple and plenty of more lunchy choices too. Its divine."

0,"I sent a photo order via web-site and it should have been ready in an hour. I went an hour and a half later and they said they didn't get it. They checked their computer in front of me and thy did get it but had not started it. They were rude and encouraged me to cancel order. I did but still get auto messages saying my order is ready. I had  already sent it to another CVS and picked it up. The other CVS I picked it up at did not have the envelopes that were supposed to come with the photo cards I ordered. They sad \""Oh, the web-site is out of date.\"" Well, how am I supposed to know!? I was so aggravated that not only did I think the price I was paying INCLUDED envelopes but now I had to go and search for these odd sized envelopes on my own! Ugh! So DISAPPOINTED! Online ordering is supposed to be a time and money saver. Not in this case! Ugh!"

0,"Our Board exams are administered in Charlotte, and the National Board struck a deal with several hotels in Charlotte, but the closer ones were booked on my test date, so I decided to give \""Crowne Plaza\"" a shot.\n\nFirst off, when I called to book, they had a bit of trouble locating the code for the corporate rate I was requesting. They also are not able to send a confirmation email until M-F business hours, so I had to call back to get it. However, booking and checking-in went smoothly, despite my flight delay and late arrival around 1am.\n\nThat sort of ends the good stuff.\n\nI went up to my room and immediately got ready for bed. There was a dark black (make-up?) stain on the side of the bedsheet. No biggie, sheets probably were bleached and washed, some oil-based make-up is just hard to get out, and at least I'm not sleeping on it. The rest of the bedding looked clean. However, I could not for the life of me figure out how to turn off the vent (I had turned off the heater, AC, and fan settings), but was too tired to fumble with it more. I figured the white noise could help me sleep. Good thing too, because as soon as I turned off the lights, I could see the 1 cm gap between the bottom of the door and the doorframe's threshold. Not good for hallway noise. However, this was not what awoken me 1 hour before my alarm set off. You see, each room is connected to its neighbor by a thin not-sound-proofed door, and I woke up to a man's coughing and television playing before my alarm went off.\n\nGroggily, I got out of bed and started washing up. Some aspects of the bathroom may be renovated (countertop), but amenities are a bit lacking. First, the towels definitely seen better days. Two of the four large ones had pink and neon orange stains on them, likely also make-up that hadn't come out with washing. But still, a bit thinned and worn, the towels should have been replaced by now. Second, there was no shower mat in the bathroom (I'm always leary of foot fungus in hotel showers), but I didn't want to wait for housekeeping to bring one over. Finally, there was a single bar of soap to be shared between tub and sink, and only a \""conditioning shampoo\"", a bit below standards for a Crowne. That being said, water pressure was great, but temperature could not get very hot.\n\nFinally, when I went downstairs to check out, the receptionist didn't even get off the phone to address me when I turned in my key. She just printed a receipt and turned her back around. I understand if she was dealing with a difficult patron, but at least have the courtesy to smile and acknowledge me. I waited for her to get off the phone to ask about the shuttle to take to my exam site, and she snappily told me it's not here yet. I asked for the restroom while I waited, and she hastily pointed down the hallway. Not what I was expecting for \""southern hospitality\"".\n\nHopefully, renovations will address some of the issues, and perhaps management will also address the room amenities and service insufficiencies.\n\ntl;dr Hotel lacks in amenities and service, but the real downside is the noise for those that need a good night's rest. Hope for improvements with renovation."
1,"Great buffet, but quite expensive (I think I paid $40). They have a great selection of meats, appetizers, pasta, rice, etc. The desserts are delectable, there's a good selection of seafood, but the downside is that the savory foods aren't as flavorful as they look. \n\nOtherwise, good buffet to go to if you want to splurge on some money. Otherwise, if you want to get your money's worth, maybe not.."
0,"I came here with some friends, and was utterly disappointed. I ordered the fajitas, and the meat was limited. I had 15 pitas but 8 pieces of meat, a little cup of guacamole, and lots of onions.

1,"I have been coming to this salon for over 6 years and I couldn't imaging going anywhere else. All the techs are so friendly, always laughing and having a good time making the atmosphere an enjoyable one.\n\nWhether I'm getting my eyebrows waxed, a pedicure or my nails done this is the place to be. I can sit back in my massage chair, relax and enjoy.\n\nI highly recommend this salon to anyone looking for a clean, quality and fun atmosphere place."
1,"My friend wanted to come here for dinner one evening...\n\nTo start, we ordered the Mediterranean plate. This was a really good appetizer. But beware because it's hugeeeee!!!! I loved the hummus and the babganoush that it came with. The cheese was good but a bit salty. For the entree we shared the truffled mushroom pizza. This thing was delicious!!!! Like reallyyyyy delicious! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Lol for drinks I ordered the red sangria and my friend got the orange blossom martini. I wasn't too fond of my sangria. I think it could've been a bit sweeter. \n\nI would definitely come back for their pizza. They also have happy hour and reverse happy hour on the weekends that I'd like to check out. It's a really cute little pizza place. Perfect for a date or even dinner with friends. They have a great outdoor patio and it's right on Mill Ave. So good for people watching. =)"
1,"Oregano's is always been one of my favorite pizza restaurants. As many of you know the wait lines can be very long. What has impressed me the last two times we were there, was that the hosts worked extremely hard to get us seated ASAP. I hadn't even received my drink order from the bar when the host came and got me and said they could seat me outside at a larger table. They showed me the table and asked if it was okay. We said yes. Then they sat another couple at the same table with us. It was a community table. How fun. We enjoyed the conversation with our new friends. The service was extremely fast and we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. besides always having great food, the service was exceptional. That's why they get five stars is exceptional service."
1,"What a brilliant place!\n\nI almost didn't write this review, so as not to let such a sublime secret become less of a secret.\nIt's a bar within a bar.\n\nIt's inside The Commonwealth, which for me is a mildly interesting, but in the end not much more than a generic hipster joint full of over-hormoned yahoos, and too much negative space and negative intelligence.\n\nBut for those who are never want to be \""on the radar\"", who like to be zen and unseen,  it's worth walking through the Commonwealth circus to get to The Laundry Room, which by comparison is quiet, thoughtful, sophisticated, expensive, and refreshing.\n\nI can't wait to go back."
1,"Loved, loved, loved this hotel stay. We got a room on the top floor, everything was so pretty and clean and brightly colored! \n\nThe beds were comfy... although if you jumped on the foot of the bed to sit, the bed popped up! Lol. Other than that, it was fine.\n\nThe bathroom was lovely. Seperate room for the toilet, see through shower, separate big tub, little TV to watch while I showered. \n\nReally enjoyed my stay here. Everything was clean and comfy!"
1,"Oh Excalibur, oh sweeet sweet Excalibur. How I love you so.\n\nI am enamored by your hallways; they make me feel homey and warm. I love your lay-down pool areas. Your exterior...simply stunning especially at night. Forget the naysayers, I love my mini-Disney for adults. The room was comfortable. But please, my love, I wish you had better shows to choose from. As much as I liked the Australian BeeGees, I could not righteously see myself watching horses and revues. A comedy show? A play perhaps? I also hope that you will one day bring a nightclub that I can enjoy! I love your spaciousness and your great selection of slots. Not to mention, your craps with better odds. What draws me closer to you is your food court, and I admire your buffet. Mcds, cold stone, krisy kreme, under one roof? A most brilliant concept! Yes, I certainly do not mind your arcade as I go in there to a get a fix now and then. I appreciate your outdoor and indoor connections to other hotels. But you are the chief, you are my buddy.\n\nThis is my love letter...just for you."
1,"This review is based on the food and delivery only as I've never been inside the restaurant...\nFood is amazing! I've had several things, fried wings, whiting and broiled flounder and all are soo good! Perfectly seasoned as you would expect. Sides: collards, mac n cheese, potato salad, rice n gravy are all delish. The loose corn I can do without, has some funky add ins with it that make it gross. Peach cobbler...yummy! Have it if u try this place out. \nI get delivery from here bc there's not many places near me that deliver. The prices are good but there is a $5 delivery fee. Sign up thru grub hub and you'll get tons of coupons though. Timing of delivery sucks though! It's way longer than the estimated time given so be prepared. It's worth it though :))"
0,"Will never use this urgent care facility again! Brought my partner in due to having some concerns with a painful flare-up in the heart area. He had some heart trouble a few months back and spent a week in the hospital, so rather than waiting to see if it got worse, we decided it was best to get it checked out right away. Huge mistake coming to this urgent care! The entire staff was rude, seemed very unconcerned and kept us waiting (just to see the doctor on-duty) for 2 hours. It wasn't busy and very few people were in the waiting area. I'm writing this review because I was truly astounded by the lack of care, professionalism and concern the doctor had, once we were finally able to see her. As soon as she entered the room, she began asking questions and interrupting half way through my partner's answers to her. It was as if she didn't believe we were here out of true concern for his health; it seemed like she felt as if we were wasting her time or she had better things to be doing. Every question she asked was VERY condescending and her attitude was extremely unprofessional to the point where I just about had to leave the room to prevent myself from losing my 'cool' and patience. Do yourself a favor and prevent frustration by using one of the other (many) urgent care facilities in this city."
1,"I highly recommend Bouchon for breakfast. Get there early for outdoor seating, the strawberry crouissants, and their specials. The hot chocolate is delicious, too. I went twice on my last trip. On both occassions, the staff was very polite and formal, but not too formal. The prices seemed very reasonable, as well."
1,"Went to Smith Center last night for The Book of Mormons.  This was the best show of the series and easily my favorite musical.

1,Excellent.  Maybe the best in the city.
1,Awesome place to race Go Karts! It's outside and right by the strip. The track is awesome and the karts are pretty fast. It's best to go later in the afternoon since it's pretty hot during the day. They also give you really cold water
0,"Never again. My daughter and I wanted to get a fun pedi before we left for a trip to Disney. We decided we would get matching Mickey Mouse heads on our big toes. I picked this place because I saw that they had chairs for kids, but my daughter wasn't even offered a seat in them. The spa pedis were decent and competitively priced for the area, but the paint job was absolutely atrocious. I should have known when they asked what design we wanted and I said Mickey Mouse heads and all we got in response were blank stares from the technicians. They really had no idea what we meant. So, I quickly did a search on my smart phone for an idea to show them. When I showed my technician right as she started my pedicure, she said, \""Ah, easy!\"" So, I sat back and relaxed and figured all would be great. They asked if we wanted our fingers done, too and I declined because we were short on time. Am I glad I didn't pay for a manicure here! My daughter's nail tech said that she would include a paint job for my daughter at no extra charge since I was getting a longer pedicure. After seeing the awful job that was done on her nails, I am so glad that I only paid for a totally messed up pedi, not a messed up mani, too! The paint on her nails was incredibly sloppy. Her toes did turn out okay (not great,) so they were decent enough to go to Disney with, but my toes turned out HORRIBLY. The tech struggled to make a round circle to start off the head! The bottoms of both of the heads on my big toes was squared off! Plus, she was attempting to center the heads and one was way off to the left. Never mind the fact that the ears are proportionally way too small for the size of the rest of the head. It all looked awful! And then, to top all of that off, when she was painting them she accidentally dragged a line of black across the rest of my big toe and instead of fixing it properly, she just tried to just dab it with nail polish remover and then immediately paint over it. So underneath the 'mickey' head immediately began to chip! WORST PAINT JOB EVER! Finally, when I went to pay I was still going to leave a moderate tip, but when I handed the girl cash she acted shocked at the size of my tip and asked if it was for both techs or just one. I will never be back."

0,"We stopped in for a coffee and a chai tea and the staff was friendly and prompt.  The coffee was just okay and the chai was not like any chai I've ever had - I'm not sure but I think there was a licorice taste in there that just did not belong in my chai.  In short, it was okay for a coffee place in a casino, but not really worth the price we paid."
1,"Excellent food, very nice staff and beautiful live music. Very clean with a warm, cozy atmosphere. If this place were closer to my house, it would be my destination every time we go out to eat."
1,"This place is HUGE and full of vendors who have a great eye for fantastic home furnishings and accessories.  TONS of glassware in right now... the new trend is the mid-century mod highball glasses, cocktail glasses and cocktail shakers-- they do not disappoint but they are a bit pricey compared to others I have been scoping out.\n\nGreat prices on some stuff, ridiculous prices on other things... this tends to be the case in these multi-vendor homegoods stores.  \n\nI used to skip the upstairs as it usually was pretty boring but that area has really gotten gussied up and is worth a peek.  They have awesome art work in the stairwell and throughout the store.  Their signature candles smell wonderful!\n\nThe people who work here could not be any friendlier or more helpful.  \n\nSurprise of the store:  They have really cute jewelry at affordable prices and have recently added cute scarves, as well!\n\n\n4.5 stars but rounded down bcasue they still have a few vendors whose wares are not fitting for this place... seems like wasted space."
0,"Mixed reviews for sure.  I've been here a few times, for various events and the only thing that has remained constant is BAD SERVICE.    Why would someone invest so much money to open a restaurant and then ruin it by hiring a bunch of idiots, who are Sloooooow and don't give a shit.   It baffles me.   \nAlot of people on here have dissed the decor,  but honestly I don't care about what it looks like if the food and service were good.\nMost of the food has been too spicy for me, but there are a couple of dishes that I LOVE (hence the 2 starts versus 1) \nThe melted cheese and  chorizo appetizer is delish along with the soft tortillas they serve it with.  And the Lolitas Rice is a very good blend of rice and beans.  The little bean dip they serve with the chips is good too.\n\nas for the drinks, hard to say.  last time I went they were out of both ice tea and lemondade in the middle of the day.  The margaritas i've had there have only been OK, nothing special.\n\nthe last time we went there was a party of 12.  they added 18% tip to our bill, which was good for the lazy slow waitress since we would have left her only a lump of coal. \n\nI honnestly hope they get it together, because the location is great.  Step it up people before you loose your investment due to an uncaring staff."
1,Paul and the whole team are just awesome!  They take the time to design a custom piece that is one of a kind and exactly what we want!  We combined 4 or 5 different ideas and were very picky about what we like.  They took all of our ideas and designed the perfect wedding ring and band for my fianc\u00e9. My band is a one of a kind Celtic knot that is unbelievable!  Highly recommend this family business.

0,"My family and I stayed at this place for our weekend thanksgiving vacations.\n\nFirst impression was OKAY, it's a cheap place so we weren't asking for much. \n\nBut even in redwood city the cheapest motels/hotels have a refrigerator and a microwave this place didn't even have that.\n\nOur room was supposed to get cleaned at 11am we came back from walking around at 2pm and our room was NOT clean we didn't have any clean towels and our beds were messed up still. \n\nAt 3pm the maid knocked on our door, we opened and she said do you need any clean towels? We said \""yes please\"" she was like okay. We thought she was going to come back but she never did. \n\nWhat was the point of knocking on the door, asking and not giving us anything I was really disappointed! \n\nI went to the office and talk to the lady at the front desk all she said is would you like to take clean towels I have some here, I had no option other than to say yes. \n\nIf I was managing that place I would of said, I'm sorry about the inconvenience, I personally will take some clean towels to your room. But I guess not everyone has the same customer service I do.  \n\nI wouldn't come back to this place even if it's cheap."
0,"Disappointing.. We went for the upgraded room and got a smaltzy Vegas room.. Nothing luxe about the broken iPod dock ( desk said they would not repair or replace) or the musty smell, very bad shower & while they put a huge flat screen in the room, they have no HD service..no. Luggage racks either..  Down in the casino there seemed to be an endless stream of underaged over-drunk kids losing thei tuition on bad bets.."
1,"Had a service issue but owner handled very professionally.  The food is very good, and have eaten there many times!  Being able to smoke cigars on back patio is a great add!"
0,"My third time here and I'm trying to like this place as it is convenient, but I just don't. The service is slow, the food potions are small, yet you pay a premium price. Their menu suggests a gourmet breakfast experience with all the pancake options, but the reality of my experiences is the equivalent of a $2.99 breakfast special with a wait and a premium price. \n\nEvery time, the food is brought out piece meal, so not everyone gets their food at the same time. The eggs are always cold. \n\nEveryone that works here is super friendly, but there are so many other options where the portions are good and the service is prompt that they can earn my business. It's breakfast, not rocket science. As much as I wish I liked it, baby stacks just isn't worth it."
0,"So earlier this year I bought a coupon off of Google Offers for Cajun Queen. I had never been here and wanted to try it so $15 for $40 worth of food was a great incentive. It took me until last week to give it a try. \n\nThe atmosphere was dark and a bit drab. The art on the walls was nice but I was here for food. The menu was concise but could have been a bit more extensive. The prices were on the high side of expensive. Thank goodness for the coupon. \n\nService was prompt but about as drab as the atmosphere. I could have used a smile from someone but it didn't come. The portions that came with my meal were just the way I like them. Not too much but enough for a good dinner. The flavor of the oysters and shrimp was above satisfactory. \n\nAll in all, the trip was worth it, but with the coupon. I would have kicked myself if I had to pay full price for the experience received. That being said, I doubt I will be returning on my own accord."
0,"We went with someone who was a regular here and they pre-ordered a lobster for us.  We had a 7 pm reservation and arrived at 7:10 pm.  We sat down and the lobster came out right away.  Yay!  Unfortunately, it was cold and apparently was cooked earlier in anticipation of our 7 pm arrival.  Boo!  Who cooks a lobster before the guests arrive?  What if they don't show?  Then the owner blames us for being late!  And then we found a few pieces of pork in the lobster.  What?\n\nThe rest of the food was ok.  The braised duck was delicious but small portion.  The ma po tofu was good.  Stir-fried bok choy hearts were good.  The stir-fried beef was over tenderized and boring.  We ordered braised fish that came out steamed.  Again some pointless explanations and the fish was replaced with the proper braised fish.\n\nOh well, a wasted night out out for dinner except for my fortune cookie.  \""You will inherit some money or a piece of land.\""  Good for me, bad for someone else."
1,"Recent family lunch at the Duck, outside under the amazing eucalyptus trees, had more great sandwiches.  It's so easy to get a really layered and yummy vegetarian sandwich with great side treats.  And the meat-a-tarians in the family loved their sandwiches too!"
0,"We go to Aces and Ales a few times a month.  The food is fantastic.   The service though can be a little iffy.   So tonight we go to use a groupon that was a gift.   Our \""server\"" Jennilee informs us - in the most condescending tone I have EVER heard that we were 7 minutes too late to use the coupon.  Well we had been sitting at the table and she had ignored us while flirting with some guy at the bar.    She then informs us that she saw us walk in and it didn't matter we were too late and the \""system\"" wouldn't allow the sale.   Well our money spends just as well in a different establishment.  I was ready to leave.   My partner likes the beer selection and after working all day it was time to eat.   Jennilee then disappears after taking our order.  Never asks if we need anything, if we needed more drinks, are we still breathing.   Now the place was not busy.   There was 1 other table, 3 guys at the bar and a few people playing pool.  Jennilee stood at the bar flipping her hair and flirting with a guy.    Total disappointment.   Utter lack of customer service.   The personality of a dead bird.   It'll be a long looonnnggg time before I consider going back."
1,"Went here for lunch with my husband and two friends today.  The restaurant is beautiful and the setting of the resort is spectacular.  The food and wine list were very good, but our server was not impressive.  He was slow to take our order and not all that helpful.  The entree portions were large, but the desserts were tiny, but good!\n\nOverall, a very nice place though!"
1,"I called from clear across the country to request an order be delivered to my ill daughter who lives within their delivery circle. Renee was wonderful on the phone informing me of their menu. I had bowls of chicken soup, salad, fresh fruit and a sandwich sent..... My girl was really surprised and said a LOT of food arrived.  Thank you so much for the good service and delivery."
0,"I'm very patient when it comes to restaurants and bad service. I have a 3 strike rule, so even if I have a bad experience once, even twice I will often try to understand and consider why the food or service was bad. But I've tried eating at this location 3 times now and each time the service was poor and twice the food was prepared wrong (and no I don't order my food any different than most). I like other NNY locations just not this one."
0,"Most of this is Fox's fault, though I will try and share the wealth where appropriate. It began with an Expedia deal involving what we quickly came to realize was a hotel well past it's shelf life - Luxor - followed by a car rental from Fox for a drive from Las Vegas for this past weekend's Coachella Festival. After taking the airport shuttle from Luxor to the airport, we wound up boarding two different shuttles to get to Fox. This nuisance has been spelled out clearly here on Yelp, and shame on me for not checking first. But while that was certainly annoying, things were about to get worse. \n\nThe clerk at Fox grew belligerent and cut my fianc\u00e9e off when she balked at a few extra fees that were not mentioned in the Expedia arrangement, and it made the situation quite unpleasant from there on in, including an attempt to upsell us on extra insurance, a $10-per-day fee for an additional driver and a higher-end car. We declined each of these offers. \n\nWe were then directed outside to the car pickup zone, where we were met by a cheerful young gentleman who told us we'd \""lucked out\"" because he didn't believe there were any economy cars available. No such luck, we discovered, though since we'd only requested an economy car, we were fine with that. Of course that was because we'd never experienced a Chevy Spark. \n\nThe Chevy Spark, if you're fortunate enough never to have crossed paths with one, has one redeeming feature: It gets good gas mileage. That's because it is a child's toy with a lawnmower engine. The car - and I use that term as loosely as humanly possible - shifts gears at around 65-70 mph, but even on flat ground it labors to do so. If you're driving up a hill, it coughs and wheezes like Doc Holliday in heavy pollen season. The engine sounds as though it will explode. It is absolutely brutal. \n\nI've rented some real pieces of shit, owned a couple of beaters, but please believe me when I tell you: the Chevy Spark is the worst fucking car I have ever driven. A small wind throws the car around like a small fishing boat in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle. The wheels are the size of fancy gluten-free birthday cakes made for two. The radio won't fucking shut off. Perhaps the wipers work well, but Fox gave us a car with a totally empty well. Alas...\n\nThere is no zero-star option on Yelp, so I'm going to try and convince myself into believing the quick, painless dropoff earned this terrible company a single star."
1,"Was surprised by this restaurant mainly due to its Diner look from the outside but by the reco of most yelpers had to try it out. First of all the inside is definitely very modern and fun to look at. My wife and I came here for dinner and the food was very tasty. She had their Hamburger of the week which had a japanese fusion which she enjoyed very much. I had the Chicken sandwich and this was amazing the moment it hit my mouth. I know live very close to this restaurant and vow to come quite often and try everything on the menu.\n\nOnly reason it did not get 5 stars was because the elbow room is not very good here, tables are RIGHT next to each other. I understand you have to pack in as much as you can but it was difficult having a conversation wondering if the people next to you who are in the middle of chewing are listening in. Other than that great place."
0,"Salsa and dips are runny, look and taste bad.  Not sure how a place with mex food this bad can stay in business.  Go somewhere better, why eat crappy food?"
1,"Just found this cool little spot and Im diggin it! Always friendly staff, been 3 times so far. Coffee is good and the tea is hand packed into a cool little bag and you are good to go! Prices are good and more then fair for what you get! Free wi-fi and comfy seats. IT IS HARD TO FIND at first but there is a free lot just out back and a quick walk around and you are in! Try the carrot cake.... AWESOME!!!!"
0,"Having tried Five Guys on the East Coast (where they originated) and liking their Burgers, I was very excited at the new location, so close to home. \n\nMy first experience was with Fried Onions only. Unfortunately, I believe the onions (which are NOT fried to order) gave the Burger a \""chemical taste.\"" The fries have a nice taste but will order them well done in the future, in order to avoid the sogginess. \n\nNot dissuaded by a NOT GREAT experience, my next trip I tried the \""traditional\"" lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise. Very little taste and the Burger, while large enough with two patties, seemed overwhelmed by the mayonnaise. Well done Fries were better than the first. \n\n\""Third time is the charm\"" I thought. \n\nThe acid test would be \""pickles and mustard.\"" If the burger was good, it would stand up to this, as do Fudruckers and Steak and Shake. Alas, not to be! The Burgers flavor did not make it through the mustard. Unfortunate, but Five Guys will NOT be on my Burger list in the future."
0,"This is the absolute WORST Steak N Shake I've ever been to. \n\nThe bf and I got lost around Pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food, the food itself was just so crappily made. It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's), our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.\n\nIf not for the compensation, I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. The bf, on the other hand, was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our Steak N Shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.\n\nI think I'm good with my Steak N Shake craving for a long time now...\n\n\n\nPS. The whole joint smells like major B.O."
0,"I liked that they offer respray if you find critters within 21 days of spray, but after 3 months of service, have had to have re-sprays EACH month. Paying extra to treat for scorpions and there are now scorpions galore and worse than prior to exterminating...\n\nAnd to make matters worse, they give a 2-3 hour window to be home and twice now, have not met that window or bothered to call to let me know they were not going to make their time slot, leaving to to reschedule and play the \""wait around for the bug guy\"" all over again.\n\nDo yourself a favor and find a more reliable company."
0,"Not impressed, sushi was ok expensive for what I ordered. Sat at the bar because I was alone an the guys behind the bar where more interested in the girls wearing skimpy outfits in the table close to the bar then making my order."
0,"The story you are about to read is true.\n\n1:42 am, Christmas 2008, my wife an I arrive at The Orleans in preparation for my wake. I am celebrating the passing of my 30's as I move to a more seasoned 40th year. In classic Vegas style, I plan on a lot of drinking in my final days.\n\nWe check in with a very nice young lady and get our keys on the 17th floor. As we pass through the casino we see die hard nickel players and aging blue hairs with their long ashes defying gravity as they extend from their thin lips.\n\nThe biggest difference between The Orleans and some of the higher priced casinos on the strip is the air handlers. I once read that the Mandalay Bay casino changes and filters the complete volume of air in the Casino six times every hour. For the Orleans, the air is redolent with smoke and cheap air freshener.\n\nOne note - if you check in this late, be prepared for a death march to your room. They issue rooms closest to the elevators first, this late and you will pass by nearly every room on your wing before arriving.\n\nThe decor is fairly nice, there was a small window in the shower that you could open to the outside. Not too desirable in the summer when temperatures stay in the 100's even in the wee hours of the morning.\n\nThis casino is not walking distance from any other (outside of the Irish Bar where I was heading) It also has a bowling alley, movie theaters, several restaurants, and of course gaming. They serve Pepsi almost everywhere although Coke fans can get a fix inside the Friday's restaurant in the casino.\n\nNot too expensive - not too fresh. This is old Vegas, the way it used to be."
0,"Going in I had high expectations for this place and was disappointed coming out. My friend had a Groupon and that's why we even wound up here. \n\nWe came in and was told it would be a 25 minute wait at 530 pm on a Thursday even though there were many spots open. We ended up just sitting at the sushi bar to avoid this \""wait.\"" \n\nWe ordered a few sushi rolls (808, chef yoshi, Da Fried Cali and the UFC), the 808 fries (delish), miso soup (really good), shrimp tempura (okay), and yellowtail jalape\u00f1o (lacking flavor). \n\nThe photos on Yelp make it look way more flavorful and delicious than it actually is. The sushi chefs were nice and friendly, the rest of the service sucked. Took forever to put in orders, water refills, get your tab, close your tab, etc. Saw one of the servers on her phone texting half the night, totally professional (sarcasm). \n\nTo sum it up, for the price you can go to a lot of other places in Vegas that will be worth it. If you have a Groupon, try it, cause only then is it worth the cost."
1,"Good food and good service.\n\nHad the sausage pizza and fried ravioli, both were good.  They had some type of plumbing issue that made the restaurant smell bad, but we ate on the patio so the smell didn't bother us.  We will probably return in the future."
0,"Fed up with this company. First time I boarded my dog here, his blanket was saturated with urine. The second time, they completely lost his blanket. Too sketchy. I no longer trust the owner & her staff. Not worth the $350 I gave them."
0,Overrated.  Overpriced. Overcrowded despite half the restaurant being empty (they crowd you in one area to make the place appear full).  Part of a hotel although most customers were locals. Food deserves 3 stars but atmosphere lacked comfort and elegance.
1,"I absolutely loved this place. It is full of eclectic items, all of which are hand crafted by artisans all over the world. The buyers for this store travel abroad to support these artists, and everything in the store is fair trade. Extra points for the fact that the company is not-for-profit. \n\nHere you will find lots of woven baskets, items made out of carved wood and stone, jewelry, candles, CD's, and other miscellaneous items that are totally unique and exquisite. This is kind of place that you'd want to spend a while browsing, taking it all in, even though it's not a huge space. You can listen to the Putomayo CD playing while you browse, and you could even make a purchase of one of the mixes. The women who work here are extrememly friendly and knowledgeable of the products being sold, and ever so willing to help. Check out the pics I've attached - lots of cool things!"
0,"Wow. If you want to be treated like *garbage* by thick-necked bouncers THIS is the place to be. \n\nI was trying to get past one to join my group's table but evidently took the wrong route. Instead of saying \""Sorry, you can't get thru that way, please go around that way.\"" I was blocked, stared down and simply told \""No, you need to leave\"" and was then promptly knocked in the gut as he turned his tank of a body around, spilling my drink all over me. I was simply shocked!! I tried to ask him how to get where I needed to be, but this *horrible* human being actually turned his entire body away from me as I tried to get his attention. \n\nFine. Forget you. \n\nSo I got around the long way and get to where I needed to be. The girl that was taking care of our table was fantastically sweet and attentive, no problems there. After splitting away from the team to bounce on the dance floor, I come back to find our table over-crowded with invaders. Before I can even squeak, there's another ox grabbing me by the arm telling me I couldn't be there and some jerk who I had never seen before sitting at *our* table encouraging the bouncer to remove me!! \n\nI asked for a manager and was simply told NO. I asked if this is how they typically treat their guests, he just stares. I fibbed and said I was staying at the hotel rather than my friends, \""Is this how you treat your hotel guests?\"" he answers \""I'm affiliated with the Bar, not the Hotel, so yeah. Don't like it? Leave.\""\n\nShocked, appalled, disgusted. \n\nThe Bar and Wait Staff were fine, but these VERY AGGRESSIVE bouncers have to GO before they either hurt someone our simply drive away all the customers.\n\nGo to Surrender or Drais, vastly superior evenings to be had there, WITHOUT getting pulled around like a ragdoll."
1,"I was sooo in the mood for a Burger... Beef!!! This place is great, went to the Cosmopolitan with my fiance fer shopping and lunch! Came across this lil joint... The ambiance is decorated with nice graffiti-ish cow paintings. My Love ordered the Greek Burger - Lamb burger with red onions, feta cheese, and thaziki sauce.... she said it was OK, Not better than Black Hogg on Sunset Blvd! I had the Machete Burger - Beef Burger medium rare, Bacon, Fried Egg, Cheese, Barracho onions, Lettuce, Tomato, Anihiem Chili, and the Machete Aioli... As you can guess... it was deeelish! The fries on the other hand was a lil to over cooked, we got the sho string fries. I suggest the thick steak cut fries! Our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly... Must come to again when I'm back in Vegas!"
1,"I love you, Chuck Hughes.\n\nYou know the way to my heart:  Lobster Poutine.\n\nGarde Manger is absolutely my favourite restaurant in Montreal, and it is not just because I'm a bit of a celebrity chef groupie. The restaurant has a great  vibe - it feels warm and cozy, the perfect place to curl up for some comfort food, yet the eclectic music and vibrant clientele make you want to get up and party.\n\nWhat can I say about the food? I've already mentioned my love for the lobster poutine. The scallops were meaty, flavourful and surprisingly filling. Though I was stuffed from all the food and wine, I couldn't resist the deep fried Mars bar with ice cream for dessert - yum.\n\nMy only complaint: it was really, truly, Chuck's day off."
0,"I was visiting my parents on the northwest side of town and we decided to try Sassy Sal's for dinner.  My first thought when looking at the menu was that the items were reasonably priced - 5.99 for most of the sandwiches.  My mother and I each got the pulled pork and my dad decided to get a combo with 1/3 rack of ribs and one side for 9.99.\n\nWell when we got the food home I was in for a bit of a disappointment.  The menu says of the pulled pork:  \""Slowly smoked seasoned pork topped with creamy coleslaw.\""  Fair enough, I'm used to good sized pulled pork sandwiches with a heaping amount of coleslaw.  There was a very moderate portion of pork but the real bummer was that the coleslaw was not on the sandwich, but a minuscule portion on the side in a one ounce cup- filled half way- even trying to spread it thin I couldn't get it to reach to the end of the bun.  The pork itself didn't have much flavor, I was desperately wishing for some sort of sauce to put on to give it some taste, but of course a side of sauce is sixty cents extra.\n\nMy dad said the ribs were good but they were also pretty meager and his side of mac and cheese was of similar proportion. \n\nWe did get a side of fries which were very good, other than that the place was a big let down."
1,"Low points first: \n- weird, office-like swivle chairs.  Uncomfortable & they kill the ambiance of an otherwise decent restaurant.\n-  beef filets, even when prepared medium rare, were dry.\n-  when your food arrives there are a ton of waitstaff, but drinks were refilled too rarely & some in my party didn't get new silverware after the appetizer utensils were cleared.\n-  bernaise sauce was kind of weak.  I'd expected more.  The shallot - red wine reduction was tastier.\n-  they told us we'd reserved the \""banquet room\"" and when we should up it was just two long tables standing next to one another in the middle of the dining room.  We wanted to do toasts for the groom but couldn't really without ruining everyone else's dining experience.  Kinda felt like they misrepresented the space, it wasn't at all what you'd think of as a \""banquet room\"".\n\nGood stuff:\n-  most everything else positive!\n-  one of the best pork chops I've ever tasted\n-  very generous portions (if I'm paying 38 bucks for a pork chop can I really say that?  I say \""yes, I can\"".  It was big, juicy, and the size was enormous.  worth the money).  Each of the sides were large as well.  Unless you're super hungry and just a glutton in general, you should plan to share the app's.\n-  raw Kobe app with Asian spices was a bit too salty, but the flavors & texture was otherwise satisfying.  \n-  poached egg, asparagus, & bacon app was awkward to eat but was sinfully tasty!\n-  mash potatoes were good but the $25 addition of black truffles didn't do much for me\n-  Wine was served properly and efficiently\n-  Tara, our waitress, we perfect.  She dealt with my group of buddies professionally without being cold.  She gave us honest answers to our questions and made sure to stop by frequently to see if we needed anything.\n\nWith so many good dining options in Vegas and me not being a big beef eater, I may not return, but if I do, I'm definitely getting that pork chop again. OMG that thing was tasty!"
0,"I had high hopes for this place,  but unfortunately they weren't met.  \n\nThe burger was smaller than expected and was cooked very well done, just shy of being burned.  Perhaps if the cook spent more time concentrating on cooking and less time hitting on customers the burger might be better.\n\nOn the positive side, the tater tots were good."
0,Shouldn't even get 1 star. My husband and I went here looking for a dresserto match bedroom furniture we have. We found something we wanted to purchase and waited almost 30 minutes for a sales person to help us then were told they would call us the next day with the pick up date and time. No call the next day or 3 days following. We called and all calls go to voicemail no-one returned our messages. We called every store in the valley and no-one returned our call. Horrible service I DO NOT recommend.
0,"I ate there for lunch and when I ordered the burger it came in five minutes.   On the way out saw the cook warming some pre cooked burgers on the grill.  If I wanted a pre cooked burger I could of just gone to McDonalds and it wouldn't have cost me 16 bucks,  I expected better."
0,"I'd give this place 0 stars if possible. Went there for pickup and the waitress was EXTREMELY rude!! Acted like I was wasting her time, didn't say hello or goodbye, just kind of left us standing there awkwardly after she handed us the reciept. The food was very overpriced for what you get (got the felafel dinner) and the felafel was very dry. Don't go here!"
1,"This was our first time there. We loved the place! It is a different concept, nice atmosphere, very friendly service and GREAT food!"
0,"The food is good, but how hard it is to make good Italian food - after all, even the O Garden can get that right. But this place believes itself to be \""exceptional Italian food\"" (which is obvious from the exorbitant prices they charge) and it is not even close. No originality, just another offering of the same tired old foods that every other place is making. \n\nThis is a prime example of what has become a scourge in Vegas eateries of late - high cost, low atmosphere, mediocre cuisine offerings - where people with more money that taste go because they know nothing more about food except the belief that \""the more it costs, the better it must be\"".\n\nOh and then there was the WORST greeting any bartender could EVER utter:   \""I'll be with you in a minute!\""   Could I mean any less to them? If I wasn't meeting somebody, I would have walked out."
0,"Terrible. Sergios installed sod at my house and didn't bring a roller. The \""crew\"" didn't even know what one was. When I called the office they told me another crew would come later in the day to roll it. I went ahead and paid. Big mistake. They never came back. The job came out terribly.  When I tried to follow up they ignore my messages. I recommend going with someone who's more honest and reputable."
1,Food was terrific!  Service was fabulous.  Went for the first time and Ill definitely be coming back!
0,"The food was okay, although lower in temperature than it should've been. The problem was the service. I ordered a veggie burrito and the employee didnt even put veggies on it until I asked, twice. (Yes they are supposed to come with it.) There was one girl on the line and she made our two meals along with the three people's orders behind us, so my food stood there for a very long time before she came back to it. I had paid and was looking at my completed meal (it was to go so all someone needed to do was cover it up) for quite some time as she put beans on other people's food. The workers were slow and they were maybe understaffed. I would not go back."
1,The oxtail soup is what keeps us from coming back to this place everytime we visit las vegas.
0,"I went to the supposed Grand Opening of Joystixx Gamer's Lounge inside of Hooters last night after April S. and Melissa S. promoted it at the Vegas Young Professionals mixer Thursday night. As you drive in, you get the feeling that you are entering the ghetto as you try to maneuver around the parking garage. Once you enter the casino, it gets even worse, so much so that you are EXTREMELY lucky to get a cell signal in the place.  You find Joystixx in a corner near the buffet and they have an air hockey table and some pool tables near the front and at least 3 rows of video games as well as some basketball hoops and skee ball. I've been to Insert Coins on Fremont and that place is heaven compared to what Joystixx is trying to accomplish. My friends and I left after about an hour since there was no one in there. We don't think the place will last very long especially if they don't advertise or try to advertise as something they are obviously not. There is HONESTLY no comparison to Dave & Busters at all.  It's pretty bad when the employees outnumber the clientele."
1,"chicken fried steak, biscuits, hash.... all in an authentic diner setting.   Perfect."
1,"I go here for the cheap happy hour beers and the company. I usually sit at the bar. The seating has gotten better but when they put the backs on the chairs people would lean back and almost break them. The cushions fabric on the chairs make you sweat badly and the concrete bar table will burn your arms in the summer and they are in the shade. The food is good and cheap. The bar waitress are good but sometimes you get that \""one\"" who won't pay attention to you at all. I think she is more concerned about popping out those fake boobs at everyone. The parking isn't that great."
0,Not happy at all with the speed or quality of the service. Very unprofessional employees with no sense of urgency or customer service skills.
1,"I get mani-pedis here regularly, the staff is super friendly, the place is clean, lots of great magazines to read, I highly recommend!!! :)"
1,Hands down one of the best sushi spots in Vegas with a great price.  Especially happy hour.  Would recommend this for anyone off the strip or consider driving out for a bit.  Worth it!
0,"This place is ok. The people who work there are amazing though. They love what they do and they enjoy helping you. They have a great comic book selection however, I wish they carried more toys. \n\nSadly, this placed is owned by a guy who only cares about profit and not customer service. Kind of a jerk."
0,I went to Deluxe Dry Cleaners yesterday to drop off some clothes to get clean before heading to LA for New Years and as the sign says $1.95 Cleaners that is for two day service.  If you want it in by 9 and out by 5 you have to pay an extra $.50 per item.  This alone was frustrating because they don't mention this until you walk in.  So I pay the fee and drop off my clothing.  I forgot to pick them up after I left work yesterday so I stop in this morning.  I come to find out the main piece I went to the cleaners for (my blazer) was not at their location.  They sent it out to get cleaned and it didn't make it back.  So as you can imagine I'm not very happy.  She stated oh it will be here first thing in the morning.  I told her that is not an option as I leave for LA in the morning and this is way out of my way.  So supposedly it will be there at 6pm when I get off work.  We will see.  As of now the best they could get was a 1 star so I reviewed it accordingly.  STAY AWAY STAY FAR AWAY\n\nUpdate:  I picked up my blazer and they ruined most of the buttons on it.  I am very upset as I received it on Christmas and it was getting cleaned to wear the first time.  I will update again after I go talk to the manager.\n\nNew Update:  Talked with the manager and they told me they aren't responsible for the manufacturer's buttons on the coat.  They said it is a risk dry cleaning anything because it may get damaged from the chemicals.  I couldn't believe it and will never go back if I could give a 0 star I would.  BBB will be getting a complaint for this place.
0,"PAY ATTENTION TO ALL THE BAD REVIEWS!! They are right. I am currently on hold with COX  - 5 minutes later listening to really bad music on a loop so I decided to share my experience here. I had COX years ago and never had a problem so I decided to go with them when I moved back to the valley. I had several months of \""hidden\"" charges on my bill and was sick of it so I decided to switch. I got a call from Patty in \""Outbound Retention\"" who asked how I would stay. (the fact that that department exists should be a red flag right there) I told her and she got me a lower rate, better service and whole home DVR service...so I stayed. 3 months later. I have had billing problems EVERY month and I am currently on hold trying to keep them from turning my service off because they say I am past due when I am not. Unbelievable. I would switch tomorrow but was told they have to rewire some things in the attic and my walk in closet is the entrance...a lot of hassle. So here I am...on hold. He is getting the job done but I have already spent so much of my own time trying to fix their mistakes. If you are stuck with COX don't hesitate to tell them how unhappy you are, ask for a supervisor, threaten to switch....those things all have seemed to work. (but do it nicely, it seems to have more clout) I am basically going to threaten them if I have ONE more problem with billing I will switch. They really don't want you to go so this seems to be the only way to get your way at this company."
0,"First had this when I first came to the university. \n\nThe gyro is too salty for my tastes, although quite affordable. \n\nThe gyro plates tastes ok, but the gyro themselves are again too salty. It is also quite expensive for a plate. \n\nOverall not the best greek restaurant"
0,This place is pretty lame. Came to see a show for some friends passing through on tour. It was so unorganized as far as getting people in the door. The doors opened an hour after they were supposed to open. \n\nWhen the show finally started I was even less impressed. The sound was awful. \n\nI'm definitely not coming to another show here.
1,Great for drinks after a long day of meetings and in the morning the breakfast  offers traditional morning fare with speedy service. \nO\nI recommend the duck confi eggs Benedict or the croque madam.
1,"When we arrived, we were able to park out front and walk right in.  At 7 on Dec 30th, we must've been one of the last to check in to our room booked on Hotels.com because we were upgraded to a suite due to overbooked.  Sweet! (It was my birthday)  We stayed in the room that used to be the one of the bank's vaults when the building was a bank.  It was spacious, comfortable, quiet as heck, and clean.  It was a little chilly but we could adjust the thermostat.  The bathroom is a little basic (compared to the Sofitel where we stayed the last time we were in Montreal).  The location is amazing, the price is right, and the included breakfast/easy parking made it all an experience we want to repeat.  I highly recommend staying here.  If you do get stuck valeting you car, it's $22/24 hrs with unlimited in/out."
0,"Food was cold, shrimp not properly cooked through, workers seemed to be uninterested in service, I suppose you get what you pay for though!"
0,"This review is about a year and a half late. Only until I saw her today on yelp is when I thought, \""I need to let these women know what MY experience was\"". My initial interaction with Sean wasn't the best. I called her expecting to set up an appointment  only to receive a less than \""warm\"" reception from her. Sean was rude, irritated and short. She basically told me (paraphrasing) that I needed to pay her up front by depositing the money in her account. Hmm! Ok! I immediately went to Wells Fargo, deposited the money so she would at LEAST take me seriously. After I made the deposit she explained to me that recently she had been setting appointments for people who didn't show. Odd, but ok! I need my hair done! She makes the appointment, assures me that she ll be ready 6am and it will take her 8-10 hours. I wake up at the crack of dawn to only knock on the door to NOTHING. Nobody comes to the door! I call her, NOTHING. I hated to bang on the door but, I drove 25minutes away from my house, at 5:30am! Finally, a smaller version of her came to the door. It was her gorgeous daughter! She was so sweet. She apologized and said her mom was still sleep. She tried to make me as comfortable as she could. Sean came down 20 minutes later explaining that she was up all night doing hair. Before she started, I told her that I wanted my micro braids to NOT be cut. I don't want them all being the same length (personal preference).She told me ok, and got started. After about every 2 hours, she would call her daughter to cut the \""fly away\"" hairs off the braids (to make them neater) and flat iron the hair (which was odd again. Who flat irons synthetic hair? )while she laid on the couch and tried to get 10 minutes of sleep. Fine by me until I felt my braids get a lot lighter. She CUT MY BRAIDS! The very THING that I didn't want. I couldn't even be mad at her daughter though. I immediately said \""Oh nooo!\"" Her mom woke up and said \""She didn't want her braids cut!!\"". I'm thinking, \""Why are you yelling at your daughter, when it's YOUR fault?\"" Her daughter wasn't around when I told her that I didn't want them cut!  So, now I'm just sitting there frustrated. Then as Sean is braiding, I'm noticing that she's braiding down only midway. Meaning, I still have my REAL hair sticking out of the synthetic hair? WTF? I asked her \""you're not going to braid it all the way down\"" She told me no. I paid her EXTRA $$$ because my hair is longer, and I have a big head. I'm used to paying a little bit more. Only to not get my hair ALL THE WAY BRAIDED! So now, I have cut braids with my hair sticking out the braid. No wonder she says you can't get the braids wet! I get braids SO that I'll be able to get my hair wet! The conclusion was, I had small braids with the bottom of them being BIG AND POOFY. She KNEW I wasn't happy as she asked to take a picture of it and saw my face. Her response? \""Smile, you'll get used to it\"". It took me a WEEK to braid those braids all the way down. Of course she posted my picture on her fb page. I like to actually get my hair braided for convenience. Not a week of inconvenience!"
1,"This is one of the best places I've ever eaten. They provide a great atmosphere as well as great food and amazing service. If your in Las Vegas and looking for a great place to eat that is not on the Las Vegas strip don't pass this place up and be sure to ask about \""See Thru Green \""and try the Crab cake Sliders!! Love this place... EAT HERE!!!!! YUMMY!"
1,My wife and I both had the HK tasting menu which at first I thought might be a little over priced but I was wrong! Every course was excellent. \nMeal consisted of:\nAmuse Bouche - Scotch Egg\nFirst course - Beet Root Salad\nSecond course - Scallop Risotto\nThird course - Roasted Beef Wellington\nDessert course - Sticky Toffee Pudding\n \nFYI...Still water is not complimentary and you will have to pay for it.
0,"Just wanted to send out a \""thank you\"" to Barnyard P. for the kind compliment he sent me on this review.\n\n\""Good of you to yelp so much, so we can all keep up with how damned clueless you are\""\n\nSo, I assume \""barnyard\"" is an owner or close friend of this place.

1,"This place scores high with me because you can customize any pizza you like.  That's hard to find at many pizza joints.  You get a cool vibe inside the restaurant as well as the whole shopping area around it.  I really suggest getting a pizza and sitting on the patio outside in the courtyard.  While sitting outside in the courtyard it always gives me a feeling like I'm outside the Phoenix metro and in an area with culture.  I guess this is the real reason I come here, the pizza is great with the versatility, but only 4 stars in my book as regards with the taste and ingredients."
1,Buckle is 'the' place to shop when you are looking for a pair of jeans.  What I value about Buckle is their customer service.  They know their products and I go into a dressing room and they are always right there offering up different styles and sizes until I find a pair that best suited to me. \n\nMy daughter shops there as well and when a pair of jeans she bought there became prematurly worn (9 months after purchase) she brought them back to the store to see if they would stand behind their product and they did!  She came home with a new pair.  \n\nI endorse Buckle!
1,"Prepare to get completely lost and to pay a bit more than you would at another Macy's anywhere else. If you can get past that, this is the ultimate in one stop shopping as far as department stores go, and you will NEVER be able to beat the selection."
1,"It's always hard to find a good poke place.  I know here in California I have to jump through hoops and drive distances away just for some good poke.\n\nWhile I was in Vegas, my friend suggested Poke Express.  They have a display full of several kinds of poke.  There's also a display of the different kinds of poke they offer, so if it's not on display, ask, and they may have it in the back.\n\nI tried the spicy ahi and wasabi poke.  The spicy ahi definitely has a kick.  But I don't like sauce on my poke, and this was my friend's choice.  What I did like was the wasabi poke.  Definitely has the potential to clear out your sinuses, so beware.  The wasabi is for sure in there.  I loved it.  The fish tasted pretty fresh, and the flavor was on point.  I will very likely be coming back here to get my poke fix again.\n\nI also tried their Saimin Deluxe.  It's a huge bowl with all the fixings.  So good on a colder day.  In addition, the spam and egg masubi was a great snack to take with me before I went clubbing that night.  Not too much rice or sauce, so I could actually taste the spam and egg.  Glad, because some places love to just pile that stuff on!!"
0,"I have to say I was not impressed with this place at all.  It has a good gimmick.  When entering there is a huge sign on the door stating cash only and you are reminded of this by the nurse who is positioned behind  a glass wall. She kindly reminds you that it is cash only and they have an ATM if you need it.  All \""patients\"" must wear a hospital gown. \nWe were sat near the paddle station but sadly positioned so we really couldn't see what was really happening except the beatings. :) (You are beaten if you don't finish your food.  in reality, you have to buy one of their souvenir paddles.). \n\nIt took a bit for our waitress to come over to us to place our orders.  There really isn't much variety on the menu, it is a burger or a chili hot dog.  I got a single burger and my husband order the chili dog with fries.  The burger was bland even with chili on it and the fries were just soggy not crisp at all.  My husband's chili dog didn't have enough chili on it to cover the whole thing. Oh, and you can't just order a glass of water, you have to pay for bottled water and the Coca Cola bottles are the smaller kind.  Paying $3 a pop was not pleasant. \n\nWe were entertained while we ate as several tourists were being \""spanked\"" but all in all the place is not worth a repeat.  Food was eh, service was eh, and the prices were eh."
0,"I've been there with my wife 3 times in the past 5 months. Every time we go, the food is amazing, however the service has been unsatisfactory all 3 times as well. They really need to improve their service. We went there tonight at 8pm and the service was acting as though it was 3am...like he was tired and just didn't care."
0,"No one has mentioned the fact that you need to be a bat to walk into this place...very overrated.  Wait staff handed out flashlights to read menu.  Seriously!  Oh, and the plates need to e that HOT!  Truly overlooked our steaks before we could enjoy."
1,"Great breakfast options from healthily to your more traditional style. The in house made granola was tasty and staff very friendly. I went alone and sat right away but it looked like larger groups had to wait a little, I say it's worth it."
1,"What an amazing amount of land. It used to be a golf course. Wow. Has anyone thought about building a disc golf course on the property? Its very cheap, environmentally friendly, and with that much area could be considered a championship style course if it was designed right."
1,"I was excited to try this Top Chef Masters establishment, and I was not disappointed!\n\nI am a Mexican food lover, and although this is not authentic - it's delicious. First, they give you a huge basket of crispy tasty tortilla chips with three different types of salsa. Perfect with the blanco margarita! I could have been fine on this alone.\n\nI ordered the seasonal vegetable enchiladas, and my husband ordered the fish tacos. Both plates are exceptional. My enchiladas did not look like ordinary enchiladas. Instead, the tortillas were stacked with veggies and cheese between them. It reminded me of Mexican lasagna. I loved the fact that my enchiladas had roasted eggplant, zucchini, and brussell sprouts! My husband's fish tacos were crisp and fresh. He was quite delighted.\n\nAll in all, the service was friendly and pleasant. I would go back in a heartbeat!"
1,"Wings wings wings and more wings....  Yum!  So many flavors, so little time.  I like this place,  there's so many different flavors and heat levels - you'll never get bored.  Lot's of beer too!"
1,"This is definitely one of the best pizza places in Las Vegas, it makes you feel like you're back in New York again. The quality of deli meats, pastas and desserts is amazing. They make a white pizza with clam sauce and shrimp which is addictive. The chicken champagne is also out of this world. Stop in for a sandwich for lunch or a pasta entree or pizza for dinner and you can't go wrong. But absolutely stop in!"
1,"I was expecting something out of Austin Powers but felt like I could have been at a bar at a beach in San Diego.  I was there on a Friday night and it was busy but not butts to nuts like you'd find at a place on the strip.  The beer is a little pricey.  $5.50 for a Newcastle, but this is Vegas.\n\nParking is a little cramped but I got lucky and got a good spot just as another guy pulled out.  They had a dj playing songs off an apple laptop and he was playing a good mix of stuff.  Made me feel like I was back in college when he put on Crazytown.  When you're here, check out the upstairs area where you can kick back with some pool.  Another interesting note about the Crown and Anchor is the it's the hangout of choice for boxer Ricky Hatton when he fights in Vegas."
1,Ate there for the first time tonight. Very friendly staff with excellent food and service. We were served by Caitlyn (Kaitlin) not sure of the spelling. Great lager from Spain and great German Riesling sine. Desert was fantastic.
1,This Chinese food is the best I have had so far and I have tried many Chinese places the service is amazing as well their half size soup is the standard large in most Chinese restaurants the only thing I don't like is you have to add white pepper salt and chile oil to make the hot and sour soup spicy I ordered the general tso chicken and they where able to do it non battered which is a plus for me because I have the gastric bypass can't have alot of deep fry all waiters waitresses and bussers have a smile this is something I see no where anymore amazing serving sizes perfect for price very genorous
0,My wife brought it home for my family. I was not impressed. The spicy food was not. The stir fry vegetables were raw. The rice - not sticky. My son could not finish his and he picked it out.  Pei Wei has better sauces. Overall it was bland. Ours was a to go order so I am sure the service is good.
0,"Went in for a Cleaning but took a Bath\nSet up a appointment for a General cleaning, after a pre exam the staff decided that I needed a  Deep Cleaning.  Without asking me they just decided that I was going to Pay about $800, changed my $50 fee to $48 and called it a Cavity exam.  I don't have Cavity just $50 lighter in my checking account -"
0,"This place is near where I work, so I decided to give it a try for lunch. The first thing I noticed is that the floor was very sticky, as if someone did not know how to properly mop it; it looked fairly clean.   I ordered the Szechuan Chicken to go.  The person at the register did not ask for my name, and when the order was done, there was no call out of a ticket/receipt number.   \n\nWhen I got back to work I found that the plastic carry out container was in a brown paper bag, which had been stapled closed.  There was not any plasticware, nor napkins.  The container was too small for the amount of food in it, and everything was smushed together.\n\nThe chicken had a very strange consistency.  It was very smooth, and much too soft.  It did not seem as though I were eating real chicken.  The food in general was very bland.  The brown rice was the only slightly redeeming feature of the meal.  I ended up throwing away most of the food.\n\nI have eaten at a number of Chinese places, and this place ranks among the lowest in terms of food quality and taste.  I will not eat there again."
0,"We were staying at the Camelback for Christmas and decided to go to BLT for Christmas Dinner as they had a special menu. We could not have been more disappointed. \n\nThe initial toasted bread and pate was very good and all seemed promising. But this was then followed by a salty greasy puffy bread. \n\nThe snails and the salad was quite good if almost too large as the salad was absolutely huge, but that's not really a negative. \n\nThen came the moment of truth - turkey dinner. It was dry, small, and mine had lots of skin and cartilage in one of the slices. Very unpleasant. Plus, the sides were very unorthodox. A chicken pot pie with gravy and dark meat. Not good. The brussel sprouts - a $10 side - were cooked with bacon and ham and all you could taste was salt and smoke. The sweet potato - another $10 side - was blended with marshmallow on top. Yes - marshmallow. We tried digging for the sweet potato but we couldn't find it beneath the marshmallow. \n\nThe service wasn't bad, but the food lacked any subtle flavors and everything was overdone.\n\nThere are much better choices out there as we discovered during the rest of our stay."

1,"According to the soya.be website the earliest recorded reference to Tofu is in the poem Ode to Tofu, written at the end of the 15th century, in 1500 AD. Well, a bit over 500 years later, I have to say that my experience at Chodang makes me also want to wax eloquent on the joys of solidified bean curd, or what we know as the humble tofu.\n\nI've had Tofu before, and tofu in miso soup but never Korean style Miso soup. I'd given blood and decided I needed something to invigorate my depleted blood supply and some Kim-Chee soup with beef seemed just the ticket. The nice thing about Chodang, it follows the Korean meal practice of setting out a number of small savory dishes, often with a mix of pickled vegies, and then bringing out the main course, which in this case was a bubbling hot bowl of soup, which the wait person will happily crack a raw egg into, which I recommend, and a side of rice. \n\nI ordered the soup a four on a  four out of five scale as my one time having truly Thai hot Thai food has made me wary of going for the top of the scale the first time in a restaurant. In  this case, if you like spicy, for four a 5 out of 5 level as the 4 out of 5 didn't seem all that spicey. However, I did love the tofu in the soup, they seemed to use a soft tofu which sort of breaks off in ragged chunks and was wonderful in the soup which was thick with kim-chee and had a number of thin slices of beef included. \n\nI do hope to come back again and follow the advice of Lester C (excellent reviewer of all things Asian, he has never steered my wrong so a shout out to my fellow elite Yelper) and try the Korean BBQ. I saw a plate of Korean short rips go by and they ,looked, as they say in Hawaii, Ono! It is a bit out of the way from where I live but only a few miles from the United Blood bank in Chandler so go do some good, give some blood and then reward yourself with a visit to this lovely Korean restaurant.\n\nP.S. - only weird thing, they serve the hot tea, which is more like warm team, in a large, plastic water glass, blah. Spif it up a bit Chodang and provide a teapot and a small cup for green tea. It won't cost much and adds to the experience.:-)"
1,Walked in from the street for a martini. The pour was generous and the bartender was very pleasant. We had a plate with deli meat and assorted cheeses that was quite filling  as a small course. Overall I thought this was a great palace  to have a drink. We saw some seafood dishes going out which looked excellent.
0,"Awful customer service from everybody there (including the post office people). Very rude, inconsiderate, and unhelpful.\n\nThe prices are not good.\n\nIt is a pain to return anything here.\n\nWe live just a few blocks away, so it is unfortunate that we can no longer go to this store. However, after numerous visits (we kept trying to give them more 'second' chances), we have come to the conclusion that it is just better to go to Home Depot a couple miles away.\n\nOur advice is to go to Home Depot just two miles up the road at Tatum and Bell. The prices are better, the customer service is friendly, and the return policy is great!"
0,"TERRIBLE PLACE! Got BBQ for 4th July and the worst I ever had.  Pulled pork was dried out and gross, the ribs undercooked. I ended up sick from it... Don't waist your money. This place is expensive and disgusting."
1,"Great food, fun atmosphere. A little speedy for what it is but if you have a yelp deal it's well worth it!!!!"
1,"The Smart Stork is yet another cute children's clothing boutique in the Bruntsfield area. If you're looking for gifts for newborns then this is the kind of place you could get gorgeous presents or christening items that they can keep until they're older and think back at their younger years.\n\nThey stock all manner of toys, pictures, room decorations, teddies, christening mugs. Most of the toys you wouldn't give to a terrible tot to play with but keep them for decoration, perhaps on a shelf in their room. \n\nYou could spend ages in here \""oohing\"" and \""awwing\"" at all the cuteness on offer and although it's not the cheapest store, the prices reflect the quality and I wouldn't begrudge paying the prices for the beautiful items for sale here."
1,"The boyfriend and I went to meet a large group of friends here to celebrate one of the birthdays in the group. I wondered what made them choose The Gold Spike, I had been there in the past and it was a decent enough bar, casino lobby but nothing to brag about. Ha! They are bragging now! This place rocks! Finally a place in town that's not a loud techno dropping, smokey, crowded, expensive hot mess! LOVED it! \n\nMy BF said got your ID ready and I'm thinking why they heck to they need that at the door. I imagine my eyes where wide open in shock as we stepped through the door. It's wide open with the bar and the little deli still in tacked but they have removed the slot machines and added random lounge spots with couches, bean bags, large comfy chairs and tall tables as well. They've added pool tables and over sized games, giant corn hole, yard jenga, giant beer pong, giant connect four and much more! Outside is an even awesomer, yea I went there, lounge area with more seats and a band and another bar. I'm sure I missed some of the other features but it was love at first sight. I love that it was big and there were a lot of people but you wouldn't know, unless you were waiting on drinks at the bar, because you were not bumping into people. Speaking of the bar, which was busy and pretty slow to get served, I'm not sure pricing, I didn't pay but you could get a pitcher of PBR for $12, not terrible. There is no smoking inside so you don't go home smelling like an ash tray and have to wash your hair again after you already washed it to go out.  Did I tell you I love this place! We'll definitely be back soon."
0,"All in all, this was a pretty disappointing dim sum experience.  They do carts as well as ordering, so we sat down and placed an order of a few dishes.  It took a really long time for our order to come out, and by that time what we had ordered had come out on carts already.  The food was alright, certainly not spectacular in comparison to other dim sum places in other cities.  The service was standard, but we had to ask for water and tea, as well as our check."
1,"This was a recommendation from My and Thao T, and I think they got the recommend from Bobby and Misti... thank you guys!  This place is wonderful.\n\nI asked the server what her favorite dish is, and she recommended the steamed sea bass.  This is what I recommend to all of you in yelp land, because my god it's so good and so unique (at least to a gringo like me).  I'm a huge fan of steamed fish in the first place because it's not greasy, but the bass is served on top of a a broth that is sweet with just a slight tang to it.  That was the first dish to go.\n\nSide note, they have bottles of chinese wine on display. Go ahead and order one, they are not expensive at all and a great complement to the meal.\n\nI also got the pad se ew (yes that can't be spelled correct) and the grilled beef salad.  No complaints.\n\nStaff is so generous, place is really clean and quaint."
1,First time there and the food was good. Not crowded which I liked. Fast device and large portions.
0,"This place is completely worthless if you don't have substantial equity in your property.  I called yesterday for a quote but realized this was a waste of time and hung up after 10minutes.  QL will not do a jumbo loan ($625k) of more than 75% LTV.  They also ask for a lot of personal info including a credit check up front in order to quote you a rate, which is ridiculous (everybody else will provide rates based upon the info you provide).  It does not appear that this company has any relation to Intuit (the software company behind Quicken) but rather simply just purchased naming rights.  I am not sure how JD Power does its survey but it really calls into question the methodology."
0,"I went with my wife on Friday evening at 8.  The restaurant was probably about 2/3 filled but not hopping.  We asked to sit outside on the gorgeous patio.  It really is a beautiful place to dine.  After a minute or two the busboy/server brought us out chips and salsa. They were pretty darn good.  Then... nothing.  We were ready to order our entrees, but nobody had even passed by to take our drink order.  One waiter kept coming out and conversing with his buddies at a table near us.  Another waitress seated an older couple 5 minutes after us.  While we desperately tried to get someone`s attention, that couple was brought out their drinks.  10 minutes slowly dripped into 15.  Finally, we simply walked out.\n\nI get overworked waitstaff, and can have patience  with that, but this was ridiculous for a half-full restaurant, with at least 3 waiters working the patio area."
0,"A group of friends, my husband and I went to McFadden's for Talk Like A Pirate party earlier this month.   Our friend reserved a table for us.  When our friends arrived they were told there was a $50 reservation fee.  I'm guessing this is how they make money now because the place was dead, including the bar during their happy hour.  We were there to participate in the event going on as well as eat.  So we decided to eat.  We told the waitress we needed separate tickets and she never mentioned they wouldn't do it until we got the bill. \n\nLet's talk food.  The food is mediocre at best, even for bar food and extremely overpriced.  I had a salad that I paid $10.99 for that I could have gotten at Wendy's for $4 and the Wendy's salad  would have more flavor.  My husband said his food was okay but he too has also had better burgers.  \n\nNow I realize that McFadden's gets most of his revenue from the football, hockey and other events going on around it but if they don't do something with what they serve and the prices they won't last long, even with a football stadium 500 feet away.  I really wanted to like this place but I just couldn't."
1,At first I was a little skeptical doing everything online even paying but I \ndid it anyway and let me tell you it was well worth it the LV traffic ticket guy help me a lot no traffic school no. Points off no going to court didn't have to go anywhere just did it all in my house by phone thank you Ticket Guy God for bid if I get another ticket you will be my LV traffic ticket guy
1,"We visited Le Village early on a Thursday night and were not sure what to expect based on the varying Yelp reviews. However, I must say that both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe wait was nearly nonexistent (it was early Thursday after all), and we were seated within five minutes despite having no reservation. Our server was friendly, but was clearly having to man a lot of duties, as it was a good 10 minutes between each visit. \n\nBut of course any buffet lives and dies on the food, and the fare here ranges from average to surprisingly good. The highlights were the fantastic crepe station (\""Le Singe\"", a banana and hazelnut crepe, was excellent), the flan, which was some of the best I've had buffet or otherwise, and the seafood offerings like bouillabaisse and arrabiata mussels. The other entries were all passable to good, and I cleared all three plates. \n\nThe price might be a touch high, especially with the Bellagio across the street for a few dollars more, but I actually preferred this buffet to the Wynn which we are in the same week. It's a quaint French countryside take on the Vegas buffet and a fair choice for your bachanalian endulgence."
0,"I give this place 2 stars because of the new car buying experience. I have always owned an Acura and never really encountered problems with buying a new car. I was referred to a salesman Chip, who by the way is amazing!!! He wasn't there at the time and  I wanted to purchase a brand new car, so I saw the next salesman named Steve W. He was just as amazing as Chip. He worked with us throughout our process and was incredibly patient with us. \n\nAt the end of our car buying, we had a bump in the road and had a huge misunderstanding about the price of the car. Steve W. remained professional and patient with us. When the sales manager, Chris B. came out, he wasn't happy with us. He was a tad bit short tempered with us and made us feel like crap. It ruined my experience with buying a car with Acura, which is probably the reason why I am looking in Henderson or California to buy (has a much more competitive price as well). Chris B. was nice when he thought we were going to buy the car, but the fangs came out when we decided not to. I think he could have handled it a little better without being so rude at the end, considering he is a sales manager and represents the company. He made us feel stupid the way he talked to us and belittled us. \n\nAll in all, I give FIVE stars to Steve W. and Chip for always making me feel welcomed. They are amazing salesmen that will never make you feel like crap and never pushy."
1,"Their seafood is really fresh. I like to get their Pearl Clam for $12. It's enough to split with another person. The scallion just brings out the freshness of the clam with the juices of the sea. I really like their combos as well.\n\nI can get some duck, some roasted suckling pig and rice. The roasted suckling pig's skin layer is like chicharron. The meat is juicy and moist.I am also able to get soup before the meal begins. Their soup is simmering the whole day. You want to go later for the soup to get the most flavorful lotus roots, carrots and pork in the soup, but you don't want to go too late that you don't get  any lotus roots, carrots and pork. \n\nI have had their duck wings. I am a big fan of duck wings. Many people don't like duck wings because it's like eating crab... a lot of work for a bit of meat, but I really enjoy these duck wings. They're made with what would be translated to \""old water\"" soy sauce. The flavor is immersed into the wings. The texture... smooth.\n\nI often see the same people going here again and again, usually servers who get off work from other restaurants and want to enjoy a late night meal. They usually sit at the same table too. I have my table there as well. \n\nI didn't really enjoy their beef chow fun. That would be my one wish, that they could make better beef chow fun..."
0,"Everytime I go into this store, there is only one cashier working but yet several employees meandering around?  Today was the same!!  But the worst was the POOR customer service I received.  I used to love this store as they do have a large variety of kids toys etc. After my freadful experience today, I wil never walk through those doors again.  Waiting over 20 mins in check out line is not acceptable."
0,Usually my stop before heading into my account if I am working the night shift.  The food is a'ight.  I usually just get a bean and cheese burrito and often find that the cheese isn't melted.  Which is crazy that it isn't warmer considered how long the wait is.
1,"I LOVE SERENDIPITY. \n\nThe decor is so cute, all pinks and oranges, so girly. They have the option to order to-go outside, or eat in. of course we ate in! they have a little shop inside the restaurant where you can buy some serendipity merchandise, but it was quite small, i kind of wished it was more. the wait for a table wasn't too bad, ~20 min? for a table for 3 around noonish.\n\nmy friend and i split a stack of onion rings, and their foot-long hot dog with sweet potato fries. I also go their infamous frozzen hot chocolate, and my other friend ordered a chocolate cappuccino and a Caesar salad. the foot was AMAZING. we barely got through our foot-long hot dog, barely touched the sweet potatos and onion rings though we tried our best, everything was SO GOOD and the portions were HUGE. My friend's Caesar salad was like a mountain! the croutons were the size of mini dinner rolls! and the frozzen hot chocolate.....O.M.G.\nthat thing came in like a goblet the size of a coconut, piled high with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. i've never tasted something so divine. i loved how it was sooooo chocolately, but without the intense sugar. this thing was more about the rich cocoa flavor than the sugar, the way chocolate drinks should be!\n\nand our waiter! he was the most adorable man ever. he was so sweet and attentive. he was quick with the orders and delivering our food, made us a fresh batch of the frozzen hot chocolate when we were unable to finish ours but wanted to take the rest to go (because it isnt' good if it's not fresh, according to him) and had the bluest eyes i've ever seen.....twas a pity he was unavailable =P\n\nmy friends and i have declared this a must-go-to every time we're in vegas!"
0,"I guess this is a chain, and maybe some are better, but this is not, even by airport standards. The menu shows 2 crabcakes on this $18 plate, but there's only one along with some fried fingerlike objects. Actually a good thing since this was the worst crabcake I've ever eaten. The discshaped fried potatoes were edible. If you ask, you'll find out that draft beer is $8 and up. Wish I had read the other reviews before being fooled into thinking that real crabs were somewhere in the recent history of the kitchen. That would have been the time to use the airport WiFi to Yelp* and avoid Gulp!"
0,"I went to Los Tacos Saturday 4/23/11. I didn't eat the food because I was SO upset by the bill I had to get a refund and leave. They do nickel and dime on everything. 75cents for a glass of tap water! Sour cream, cheese, avocado. The up charges where $8 on a $20 bill. Long story short I did get my money back and went to macayos across the street. Macayos was a little more $2.00 but I got fajita instead of a burrito."
1,"I'm not a huge fan of NY style pizza (ok, I'm not a fan at all)... but I was pleasantly surprised by their pizza!  I mean, I'd still take a Chicago-style deep dish pizza over this any day of the week, but if I'm in the mood for thin crust pizza with a good combination of sauce, crust, and cheese, then I'll come back here!"
0,Room is kinda boring and basic. It's just the usual small two queen room with a tv and a restroom. Nothing out of the normal. Other hotel rooms here in Vegas look way more grand than this. There is an open case of Ferero rocher left here and the coffee maker also wasn't cleaned out. Will not be returning.
0,This was pretty disappointing.  Ok it is NOT an over 30 club or chill like some of the reviews seem to bill it.  Yeah its pretty but the fact you have to pay 250+ to be able to sit down.  Yeah so no where to sit and a crowded dance floor means that you get up there and have a wander.  Thats about it.  The line up is stupid and really not sure what the criteria is for how fast the lines work but this was really not the chill dance club I was looking for.
1,"I enjoy a variety of things on the menu, and I like the approach to eating healthfully.  Unlike some of the other Fox restaurants, I don't think this one is overpriced.  Where else can you get quinoa salad?  I'm not a vegetarian, but I eat many of the vegetarian options because they're so tasty.  The \""TLT\"" (a fake BLT) is amazingly good.  And, of course, the hummus is one of the more unique takes on that dish you'll find anywhere.  The wine list is spartan, but that is a sacrifice you'll have to make for their good, healthful options.  Last, I know it isn't their fault, but be prepared to be annoyed with the Biltmore's ridiculous parking system."
1,Katie did a good job on my gel manicure.  The only thing missing was a hand massage with lotion.  No hand lotion at all during the entire manicure.  Lana gave my husband both manicure and pedicure.  She was personable and effective. We will go back.
1,"The chicken quesedilla with guacamole and sour cream and salsa on the side is my favorite.  I am hooked on it, as their tortillas are so fresh - they are made on the spot, as well as the grilled meat.  Also, I have tried the grilled chicken salad, which is very tasty, with an unfried tortilla at the bottom.  Try it just for the tortilla!\n\n5-19-13 I was craving Mexican after having Frank and Fina's and remembered Cafe Rio. The pulled chicken quesadilla was calling my name!  I opted for the wheat tortilla, quite tasty, this time, and asked for an extra guacamole instead of sour cream.  I had half and it was fantastic!  The only thing that holds back the five star rating for this location is that the cashier is not paying attention and almost did not include my pico de gallo after pointing it out to her, and grabbing it for myself!  All in all a good fast food Mexican place."
0,"I've been wanting to try fatmans since an article in the paper several years back, just never had the opportunity to try it. Now that they moved to a more convenient location I was excited to try the pizza. We got the deep dish and the presentation was amazing. The pizza was loaded with cheese and toppings the crust was cooked perfectly. But once I got the pizza home it severely lacked flavor.  I am very disappointed"
1,Local favorite. Wife and I been coming here for years. Breakfast special is my fav!
1,Free holes with every order. I love Dee's
1,Came here on a Friday around 6 and was seated right away. Its a cute little place and had a nice vibe. I was here with Jessie B and we ordered  a few of the small plates. Since we sat at a table we did not get HH prices..o-well. We wanted to be comfy & not sit at the bar.\nSo we started with crab & artichoke dip..it had real chunks of crab and was super creamy and came with toasted bread slices.\nNext was the sashimi..I know its a tapas style place but there was only 3 pieces. It was so yummy I could have eaten 3 orders!\nLast was something we got talked into by our waiter who was very friendly & even brought us extra ice for our sippy cup drinks we already had walking in.\nWe were gonna get the pizza pops but he said..ehh\nSo we ended up with the crazy mac & cheese flat bread.\nIt came with a pesto/ranchy sauce for dipping. It was soooo wierd.\nI still dont kno if I loved it but it was something different for sure.\nThere is a very good selection of yummy small plates..something for everyone. I love that!\nAnd I really loved the server being so nice & helpful. Thumbs up!!
0,I agreed with Gary K. (his description is right on the money). This place is mediocre at best. Much better selection at Hibachi grill or Lin's Garden.
0,"Frozen yogurt is frozen yogurt, to the layperson.  I doubt you could tell the difference between this place and any other in town in a blind taste taste.  These guys are getting one star for a very simple reason.\n\nI really, really, REALLY hate it when people put their marketing crap on my car while it's in a parking lot.  So you can imagine how irritating it was to come out from the movie theater and find their little 10% off cards tucked into EVERY FREAKING WINDOW of my car.  Six of them.  I'm not completely sure of what the community standards are here in regards to four letter words, so I'm just going to keep thinking them instead of typing them.\n\nGo clean up your parking lot, Swirls.  And hire a sign-flipper or something.  It's way more eco-friendly."
0,"WOW, I have never had such horrible customer service in my life. The associate was completely inept, he could not comprehend the most basic concepts and I was forced to repeat myself numerous times. I asked him for an address and contact information for a service center because the car I rented needed an oil change right after I received it; and he told me he didn't know the address and said \""he service center down this road somewhere you will find it\"" a disgruntled look is all I could muster up for him. Anyway I will never go back to them again and wouldn't even bother calling unless you want to be on the phone listening to drivel and unanswered questions for hours"
1,"Mozen Bistro at the Mandarin Oriental gives their customers EXACTLY what they pay for...tasteful decor, outstanding service, excellent food quality AND presentation. Adding to my brunch love affair, their unlimited Veuve Clicquot for only $35 seriously had me considering forwarding my mail to Mozen Bistro."
0,"I came here for lunch on Saturday, and ordered a club sandwich.  After eating, my friend and I went back to our hotel (at Monte Carlo) to take a nap.  After about 2 hours, I started getting horrendous stomach cramps.  A few minutes later, I was vomiting uncontrollably every 20-30 minutes for SIXTEEN HOURS STRAIGHT.  It was THE worst food poisoning experience I have EVER had.  I seriously thought I was dying, felt like my stomach was going to come out of my mouth.  I then had a horrible fever for the next 24 hours... what a GREAT way to spend my Las Vegas vacation!  \n\nI reported it to Tropicana, but thinking I probably should have reported it to Las Vegas Health Department as well, I wonder how many other cases of food poisoning there were this day.  Vegas is known for their awful restaurant grade ratings, but I really thought this place would be of high quality being new and being a part of a big casino/resort that had just been renovated.  I still cannot believe this happened, and want to make sure people know this was NOT the stomach flu, as that is HIGHLY contagious and my friend who was with me did not get sick at all (she ordered the buffet of all things, she's lucky she didn't get food poisoning too!).  \n\nNEVER again will I EVER go to this restaurant again, they serve poisoned food!  I just wish there was an easier/better way to prove things like this... and unfortunately for the Tropicana, I do work for a travel agency and our agency will NOT be using the Tropicana for any of our clients again."
1,"Alright, so I'm giving this place the honor of being my very first review just because their ratings are so varied. Anyway...\n\nI've been to Get Nailed 24/7 multiple times. I've gotten hit or miss results with different nail techs and different times of day, but I feel like I've got it down to a science now. So listen up. Please, please, please make sure that an awesome lady named Mum does your nails. Her gel manicures are perfection (no painting outside the lines), and last (sans chipping or peeling off) for upwards of three weeks, for sure exceeding any of my previous gel mani lifespans. And if you're down with the three dimensional, the cute lil 3D bow and heart designs she's put on my nails have lasted equally long.\n\nLadies (and Gentlemen?), have some common sense. This is not a \""locals\"" nail salon due to it's proximity to the airport, the Strip, etc. I'm local and honestly the reason I go here because Miss Mum does such an awesome job and because it's close to my office so it's quick/easy to go during my lunch break. It's not rock-bottom-cheap, but it's not resort-spa-expensive either. Don't be dumb and expect to get in and out of there without waiting on like a Friday night, because that's really not gonna happen. You can always call before to see if there is a wait (and to make sure Mum's working), and plan accordingly for getting nailed in a timely fashion.  ;]\n\nx"
0,CLOSED. This building is shuttered and the place is CLOSED.
1,"When you're in Pittsburgh, you choose between Aiello's or Mineo's. Most people choose Aiello's, and it's not hard to understand why. The za doesn't LOOK great, as compared to others in Pittsburgh, but it TASTES most excellent. The sauce is somewhat sweet and somewhat spicy, the cheese is decadently salty. The crust is a bit dry, but not horrible. I could eat this pizza for the rest of my life and never be sad. (In the end, I choose Mineo's over Aiello's, but Aiello's is an A+ pizza.)"
1,"I'm a Phoenix native and whenever I am home, we go to Chompies. My daughter loves Chompies bagels. So much that she calls bagels \""chompies.\"" I got her hooked on the bagel bites because they sell them in Sprouts out her in SoCal. \nTook the whole family and everyone was happy. This is a place you can take that has somthing for everyone."
0,Stay home.
1,Cheeseburger Animal Style... Unreal!!
1,I went here in the late afternoon and there wasn't anyone else in the restaurant which is exactly how I like it. I had the som tom and Thai beef jerky with sticky rice ... I was thoroughly satisfied with my meal! I'll definitely be back.
1,"Great donuts. The best donuts I've found in Arizona so far. Moist, light, fluffy--all at once. Get ready to smell this place from across the street. So yummy!"
0,"We had a bad experience when we took our down comforter here. When I took it out of the bag at home it had an ink stain on it! I understand that sometimes pens may get mixed in with the wash, so I took it back  to have them get it out. They told me that they did not think it was possibly that it happened there. It definitely did not have an ink stain on it before we brought it in.  With a bad attitude they begrudgingly agreed to fix it. After a week or so they got rid of the stain and credited our account with what we'd originally spend. My boyfriend has taken some of his work clothes here to get laundered with the credit, and they seem to do a fine job."
1,"The store is usually clean and organized, so it's easy get in and get out if your looking for something specific. Return policy is ok. More selection than Ross and is just a smidgen better than TJMaxx. I live close so I'm always popping in checking on any good deals in the home department. Good shopping spot!"
0,"WHY does Anthem have such a terrible food scene?! I've been here twice. The first time was alright. Our food took forever. The servers are a  \""little rough\"" around the edges, but friendly. The food is overpriced, but the thing I found the most disturbing, was while we're in family friendly Anthem, this place plays rock music which is fine, but it is not censored. I'm sitting there listening to f***k over and over again during multiple songs."
0,My stuff was stolen from my room. Management and staff unhelpful and unapologetic. Going to file a police report.
1,"This was the first time I visited Carrabas - was in town and having dinner with the folks  - me madre picked it. \n\nKinda cool atmosphere, very comforting and not too loud. We started with the caprese appetizer - very good mozzarella and the tomatoes were incredibly fresh. \n\nI had the classic combo which is chicken parmesan, lasagna and some of their house pasta. The chicken parmesan was thinner than I thought it would be, but it was tasty. The lasagna is a fairly small serving, but very tasty as well - could be a great mea on its own if the normal serving was much bigger. The house pasta was ok - nothing to shake a stick at.\n\nMy grandmother had the salmon and seemed to enjoy it - the folks had fish as well and they had no complaints.\n\nService was excellent. All in all, not bad. I would say it is a bit pricey for what you get as far as serving size goes, but at least it was good."
1,This supermarket is literally the best place to find your everyday ingredients for Asian dishes. Produce is fresh and they have fruits and veggies that you can't find anywhere else. Their meat and seafood sections are the best because they have everything and it's all freshly packaged in front of you. My favorite sections in this store are the ramen section and the snack and candy section. They have more asian ramen and snack selections than you can imagine. I go here every other week:)
0,"You can certainly tell which reviews were written by friends, employees or owners.\nThe beans were the only item with any taste. Soggy meat, held in hot water, sauce that didn't  qualify as sauce.\nI've had bad, however this tops the list!"
1,"Very delicious. Had the Pork Tenderloin Medallions. Was excellent! Moist, succulent, and paired with eggplant and shredded pork wrapped in an egg noodle sheet. \n\nThe friendboy ordered the Braised short ribs. Also, very tender and juicy. \n\nDecor was nice, ambiance was just right for a nice romantic mood, and was also cozy.\n\nDo not order drip coffee/french press. It looked like tea with fershly ground black pepper."
1,"What a great place this is. It has a home feel to it. The service is spectacular and the food is just as good. On top of the food and service, Montesano's is a big supporter of the community and it's schools. Three years in a row, they have sponsored my schools yearbook. Great pizzas. Great bread and garlic knots. Overall, just a really great place. Do yourself a favor and become a regular. Don't forget to try the cannoli."
1,Im there 2 or 3 times a week and my office always picks up bagels from Bagel Nosh for our client meetings. My favorites are the Tomato Basil bagel or the Cinnamon Sugar bagel.
1,My first time here! Loved it. Will definitely come back :) Also loved that they had a deal on groupon
1,Wow!  Their cocktail list blew me away.  So rare to find a place with a well rounded list of old school cocktails!  Each one is like a pice of art crafted to make you smile.  After the aperitif this place keeps me happy with outstanding food.  Bacon Popcorn: Delish.  Olives: Excellent to nibble with cocktails.  Mac & Cheeze: American standard done well here.  Chicken and Waffles: Gluten free and tasty.  Short Ribs: Big portion and well prepared.  Scallops: A savory take on this normally light dish.  Pudding Dessert: Hit the spot.  Best meal I've had in a long time!
0,the service is ok the food is not that good and they charge the tip 15% on receipt  don't go there
1,"First line to pay then second lines to wait to be seated. Weekday around 11:30 pay line was longer than the seating line. \n\nThings I liked @ brunch:\nSmoked salmon with capers and cucumbers good portion and yummy\nAngry Mac and cheese, angry bc of the hint of spice.\nKorean BBQ ribs-a bit tough to cut with a butter knife but the flavor was delicious\nThick cut slab bacon at the carving station\nGelato- delicious salted caramel and tiramisu. \nHomemade marshmellows, soft fluffy goodness\nMini apple crumble pie tarts\nBalanced sweetness of warm French toast\nCocktail shrimp- stock up on these single shooters \nCheesecake with raspberries on top was yummy perfect texture and richness\n\nThings to avoid:\nGreen curry noodles in the take out box. Awful! Blan fettuccine like noodles with tasteless green paste.\nEggs Benedict the sauce tasted like a package mix. My egg was runny and fine but the bf's was solid.\nsushi- minuscule and lacking any sort of real fish. The imitation crab wasn't even good.\nstrawberry short cake- bland tasteless best thing was just the strawberry on top. \n \nOverall good, I enjoyed the food that I tried and there were enough things that I wasn't stuck with just two favorite dishes. Much better than othe buffets I believe for the price and quality. \n\nP.s. I didn't notice many people tipping and over heard some servers complaining about it. I get that it's a buffet and you're getting your own food, but people don't forget to tip at least a few bucks for those who are bringing you drinks and clearing off those tables.\n\nI had a mimosa and asked for a coke and tea, and of coursed tipped a few bucks to our server."
0,Wanted to go try this place out for Restaurant Week. Stopped in and when we were greeted at the front we were told the earliest we could get in was at 9pm. There were many empty tables and there wasn't even a waiting list for people without reservations. The situation at the door just wasn't handled very well. Can't comment on the food but we'll eat at one of the other hundred restaurants in the metro area. We know we can get some food there.
1,This store has become my morning power walk destination ...i felt it was a trader joes with expanded aisleways  ( my main beef with trader joe's ) i like the meat and cheese selection...the prices...hmmm...jury is still out on that one...comparable to trader joe's...the specials probably give f&e the upper hand over trader joes...  it's a welcome addition to my neighborhood
0,"Left package at wrong address. Called customer service and they told me they may not be able to help until the next day??? \n\nLucky the person that fot my package was honest and brought it me. \n\nThey said they just found it sitting on their porch,  never even rang the doorbell or knocked.\n\nAmazon needs to dump this company!"
1,"I am torn between 3 & 4 stars - but I decided on 4 due to its wonderful location, hospitality and welcoming atmosphere. \nThere are many outdoor camping tables and seats which make this place the perfect beach pub. \nIndoors it divides up in 2 areas - since they closed the restaurant bit all is now used for drinking and snacking. The main bar is usually used by a large group of musicians playing diddies and drinking beer. the middle of the floor is mostly kept free for dancing (if you so like and we have seen many a times people doing so) \n\nThe fireplace is roaring in autumn and wintertime. The place is full at the best of times and packed all other times. Standing room only. There is not much special regarding the beers or other drinks served - apart that it is slightly more expensive than other pubs. They have no real competition as they are the only one for about 15 min (on Bath street  corner you have the Espy) \n\nI am still not sure why I am giving this 4 stars - but solely for the summer enjoyment and convenience they get an extra one."
1,"The hip hop room was packed. I was by the dj stand just hanging out with the Dj's. It was Dj Redfoo of LMFAO. Who was cool as his cool hair and gogo dancers.  He posed for a pic behind the Dj booth and wished us celebrating a happy bday.  Thanks Redfoo!  Then moved up to the rooftop EDM room.  If you want the total vegas experience. This is the room you want to be in.  Mosh pit if that's your thing with confetti shooting out at the crowd. The space girls intergalactic dancers on top of the dj was entertaining. The pool area.  Wait am I in Miami or Vegas? Pro-Favorite overall club in Vegas coz I had a good experience with the Dj's, the dancers, security, servers, & I liked the polite mixed crowd.  Con-getting a workout walking up I don't know how many flights of stairs.  Almost felt like I was a Firefighter in training.  I got to take the elevator back down to reality so that was good.  Gals & guys if you are wearing heels!  Take that sh*t off and bring your workout shoes.  After going up those flights of stairs you might end up soaking your feet in the pool instead of dancing the night away"
0,"Service is terrible. Dining area is less than sub-par in cleanliness.  Come maybe for appetizers.. but even then, expect to wait.  Between food on the floor to our waitress that didn't seem to care about anything until she came with the bill... I'd say, if you can opt for some where else to go - than do so."
0,"I was so looking forward to coming here. It was the one place I told my friends that I really wanted to go. I don't think I have ever felt so uncomfortable in a restaurant in my entire life. We went at a non-peak time, restaurant half empty, just to grab a couple of drinks. We told the hostesses and waiters we were just getting drinks. Took nearly 30 minutes to get first drink order. Then our waiter complained about us to hostess since we were not ordering food. He grabbed everything off our table and was super short with us. Hostess then came over and apologized and said we weren't being rushed out, but could move to another table. Since we were done with our drinks, we just opted to leave. I would have loved to come back, but there is no point. I am not a fussy diner, I don't send food back and never write negative reviews but, this really ruined an experience for me that I was actually really looking forward to."
1,"We stopped by this place around 9 o'clock in a morning. There was a line, but it was moving really fast. We did not spend more than 10 minutes in it. \nI ordered an espresso, nutella brioche and a pastry called Intense. This pastry really lived up to its name!!! It was super sweet. I think it was the sweetest thing i have ever had.  The espresso was very strong.  It was so strong that it went right into my brain and it kept me up all the way back on my drive to LA.\nNutella brioche was nothing special. I don't think i would buy it there again.  The next time i am in Vegas i will be back to try their crepes and ice-cream."
1,"I called AZ Elite Transportation for an airport pickup at PHX. The driver who picked me up was curtious and on time. He was attentive to road conditions and did not look at his cell phone the entire ride which I have found problems with other companies. I travel back to AZ often and have used multiple other services, and AZ Elite Transportation stands out above the others.  I would have to recommend this service; no complaints"
0,"OMG! Stay away from this location, the bathroom is a mess! The toliet seat is broken in half  and they were out of toliet paper except for the bunches on the floor. \n\nI sent a email to Carl's Jr as well as calling their \""guest\"" Hotline asking them to fix the problem before someone gets sick. I asked to be contacted by the GM or district management, nope I did get a a very nice email from Carl's Jr COO Carl LeLecke tell me he was sending me some free food coupons...  I waited two days do post hoping the would fix the prooblem I went back in today and the toliel teat is still  the broken one and most of the toliet paper is off the floor. \n\nYou know what they say about bathroom conditions and clealiness of restaurants.\n\nYikes!!!"
1,"Modern French bistro American style tucked away on the third floor in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  Superb location as it overlooks the Strip, has floor to ceiling windows letting in lots of natural light.  However you could also sit near the front of the restaurant which is darker and more tavern-like.  I'd been wanting to try the Comme Ca burger since we visited the Melrose location so I was really looking forward to dining here.  I knew their cocktails were solid so that justified the $15 price tag ($15 is average in Vegas; the question becomes whether it is worth the $15) - I had the Aviation (gin, lemon, infused cherry) which was strong and refreshing albeit a bit small.  Then the Prohibition Punch - really liked it and was more along the lines of what I was looking for - crisp, sweet, refreshing but strong. Actually this was my favorite place for specialty cocktails; definitely superior to La Cave or Sage IMHO.  Then we had the oysters to start, and while I am not a huge oyster fan, these were very good, fresh, tasty.  Then the burger medium rare which was excellent.  Fries are pretty close to perfect - crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside.  The aioli is the string that ties it all together.  Will return for sure."
1,"Yummm love this place! I thought it closed but found out from a friend they just moved, THANKFULLY! Their angus beef, chicken, and gyoza are my favorite. Numm numm and love their sauce bar for dipping;)"
1,"I always love a place where the employees look like they're having a good time, and Ike's had it! Rachel was the best - not only really enthusiastic and attentive, but also a lot of fun.\n\nWe got the Bear Hug and the Spiffy Tiffy . Both were fantastic and the dutch crumble bread tasted like a buttery biscuit. All the ingredients tasted fresh and high-quality, especially the pesto. Large portions, though, so we got a dinner out of it, too.\n\nA little pricey, but definitely worth it, especially because we happened to get there during happy hour (4pm-7pm, I think) so we got a free drink and chips. They also give a caramel apple pop with the sandwich.\n\nCan't wait for the new location opening soon on Mill Ave!"
0,"I never write reviews but this is the last time im eating here. Service is the worst!!! First of all they dont greet you when u come in or leave. The waiters are really rude. they only come to take your order and to bring your food. After that they never came back. We had to wave them down so we could get our bill. It felt like we interrupted the waiters conversation as they were chit chatting being it wasnt busy at all. We ordered the masman curry and chicken pad thai and it was decent. Other than the nice decor there was nothing special about this place. Their service reminds me of \""Dick's\"". Its a restaraunt where they are purposely rude, but its like the servers at pin kaow didnt even have to try."
0,Just didn't do it for me. The food was bland and overpriced. I had a better meal at the Cheesecake Factory at the Biltmore Fashion Park.
1,"A place that wins my mama's heart, wins my heart too. I took my family out to dinner here. I wanted my first time trying it to be an experience I could share with the rest of my family. Because they know I'm a Yelp addict, they were mocking me. Describing the detail of the place, and the food they had. Here's the breakdown.\n\nMy sister: \""I love that the place is so clean, and the interior are so properly put into place. You sure can't miss the games playing on tv here since in every angle you turn, there's a freaking tv.\""\n\nMom: \""Wow. I love this place! Their oysters are ssssooo good. It's big! Usually other places I go their oysters are so small. This one is so big that I can't eat anymore of it.\""\n\nBrother-in-law: \""This catfish is good. I taste a light cajun flavor to it, but it's still good!\""\n\nMe? I had the 1 lb lemon pepper shrimp. I opt for the medium spice which the nice waitress explained would be comparable to a 6 in spice. Did I taste a hint of sweetness in the sauce? I think so..I don't know if it's like some secret bbq sauce, house sauce, or even sugar..but it won my heart. It didn't taste much like lemon pepper, but I didn't mind since the sauce was just awesome either way. Lemon pepper schmemon pepper. \n\nEmily was so wonderful She was so patient with us We asked for a lot of small things, and requested a wrong order be changed. She was just so nice to get what we needed. Not a hint of irritation her face! She was always quick and prompt at getting what we requested. Thank you Emily for putting up with us! \n\n$2.50 for drinks\n$9.99 for a lb of shrimp (but varies. it is by market price)\n$8.99 for 6/raw oysters\n$8.99 for catfish combo $1.50 extra for the sweet potato option. (Oh! mom LOVED the sweet potatoe. She's a big sweet potatoe fan.)\n\nSatisfied customers? Priceless...\nThey also have happy hour! Yay happy hour!"
0,"Unfortunately I tried Pool Masters for 2 months because they came over the same day when I called them from a craigslist ad (this should have been my first clue.)  I have a brand new pool so it shouldn't be that difficult to keep care of.  After all, all the equipment is new, the water is new and the whole pool is new.  But for some reason, the guy they kept sending out found a way to mess up the programming on my new equipment to where it would drain the hot tub every night and run the prime out of the pump every day.  After calling for about a week, one of the owners finally decided to come by himself and fix that issue.  Then, they kept saying they would clean my filter but in two months they never followed through to do what they promised.  Lastly, they never returned the key to my gate (promised to mail it to me - ha!), so now I am searching for a new pool company that wants to do business with integrity and someone who actually knows how to clean a filter.  I would strongly recommend you search elsewhere for a pool service in Las Vegas.  There are plenty of other companies out there.  Hope this helps you make a better consumer decision."
1,"Came here the other night with a $30 for $60 Groupon.  I have to admit, my expectations were lowered after reading several of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nFirst the d\u00e9cor.  It was nice, a little too dark for me, but overall I liked the feel of the place.  We sat in a high-back booth in the bar area that felt very private.  Even the bathrooms were well kept and modern-looking.\n\nThe service was also very good.  Our server, Shay, took great care of us.  She was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and kept our water and tea filled all night without us asking once.  Our food came out quickly and the billing process was also fast.\n\nThe food was good but not great.  They have a decent kids menu for $6.95 and my boys got the bbq ribs and mac and cheese.  First the ribs, tender, well seasoned, and a generous portion (5 or 6 bones).  The only problem was the sauce was a little spicy, especially for kids, so my son ended up eating my wife's food instead.  The mac and cheese was average.\n\nMy wife and I shared a wedge salad to start and it was the typical wedge, iceberg, blue cheese, bacon and tomatoes but it was good and fairly priced at $5.50\n\nMy wife went with the maui ribeye (marinated in soy and pineapple juice).  It was well seasoned and served with a loaded baked potato.  She ordered it medium but it came out closer to mid well-well done.  The meat was still flavorful and tender so we didn't send it back.  The baked potato was perfectly cooked and had enough flavor that no S&P was needed.\n\nI got several of the appetizers for my entr\u00e9e (potato fritters, beef carpacchio, and mesquite grilled shrimp).  The potato fritters were good, basically fried balls of loaded baked potatoes served with a semi spicy remoulade.  The beef was okay, needed a little more dressing on the arugula and seasoning on the beef.  The shrimp was the most disappointing, 4 grilled shrimp with little flavor and some sort of onion slaw that didn't go well with the shrimp.  I found myself dipping the shrimp in the potato remoulade and it was much better.\n\nThe place was a little pricey but the groupon made it a more than fair deal.  I would go back to try some other items but probably order any meat a temperature less than I normally would."
0,"I've had much better. Keep looking, FUEL not food."
1,"Cool new venue! \n\nOnly been open for a few months, but Andrea's is a perfect fit into the Encore's line of fine dining. The ambiance is very chique and hip, great list of wines and cocktails, and excellent food choices. We had a large partry (10+), and they were very accomodating. We tried a bunch of little plates / appitizers, and they were all delicious (the Wagyu Beef Tataki was my personal fave).  For dinner, I had the Seared Ahi salad (delicious) and the Wagyu Rib Cap (most flavorful steak I've had in months) - however, it was only 6 oz....which is kinda small. \n\nCome here hungry, cuz almost everything sounds delicious, and their dessert menu is something you don't want to skip! (we tried the trio sampler, and all three were awesome)."
0,"So, I went to Buca di Beppo a couple of months ago as I was in P-burgh for a meeting.  I hadn't eaten since the morning and was very hungry and thought I would drop in for an early dinner.  Bad idea.\n\nI came in alone and not with a group and I came in early.  Not really their target demographic; however, they had no idea what to do with me.  So what did they do with me?  The put me in some back room near a kitchen.  Just me, some gangster memorabilia, big band music... and an empty room near the kitchen.  I eventually found a server and told him that I would eat at the bar, you know, where there are other people...\n\nThey let me order off the lunch menu, that was nice, so I ordered a lunch portion spaghetti.  Another bad idea.  The spaghetti sauce was terrible, tasted like catsup, the pasta was \""old\"" and seemed like it had been in the refrigerator for a couple of days and the meatball tasted like they walked over to McDonalds and asked for some hamburger meat.\n\nI realize that Buca really isn't structured to serve the one-man early-dinner customer.  And that is another drawback.  The place is located in a business center area.  They need to know who their potential customers are.\n\nThe Station Square location is kind of odd, it is tucked in by the river between the tunnels.  However, just walk across that cool bridge and find a local place across the river in the down town area.  Avoid Buca unless you are with a big group and want a pasta-heavy meal.  Actually, there are Italian restaurants across the river or further up Carson.  Just avoid Buca.\n\nNot going back to Buca, in any city.\n\nAside, P-burgh is a cool town and I can't wait for my next trip back."
0,"I've had bad luck with the Deli at this Basha's. two time this year I've ordered a pizza and when I come to pick it up there is NO pizza!  1st time my order slip was found on the floor and then thrown in to the trash. Today's order, well the deli personnel act like I never called it in. I ordered a sausage with extra cheese and spelled out my name, because its unusual. They apologized and offered to make me another one, it'd take 15min. Well I've already waited 30min!  I left to go to SPROUTS to buy a frozen pizza. Basha's pizza is ok. I get it because I believe in shopping local. I live in Verrado and I want to support local businesses. It's a WIN WIN situation. I called and spoke to the manager, Tiffany. She apologized and offered me a free pizza next time. I told her she needs to look at the deli personnel and re-evaluate their procedures for taking orders. She even told me when I call to ask for the manager and place my order with them. A manager has time to take pizza orders??? It's one thing to own up to a mistake BUT totally something else to tell the customer they never order in the first place. Now we call the customer a liar!  I believe I'm done with Basha's."
0,"Arrived on a Saturday and there was a dj and gogo dancing by the bar but by Monday just a spot to grab a drink, catch up on sports and play video poker. Service was adequate not much more to say."
1,"This is my fav China buff. Highlights are the crab puffs, potstickers, orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and those little sticks o' grilled chicken. Best way add 2k + calories to your diet."
0,"over priced for the portion... So small. For 8.99 , the sweet n sour beef lunch special I had 7 small bite size pieces.. The flavor wasn't in the meat at all. There was only one other customer sitting at the bar. Got here around two pm on a Thursday. Quick to bring the food... But I will not be returning."
0,"Went to Otto near the gondolas and then later here. Both places we ordered the exact same pizza, margarita with extra basil. The pizza at Otto was much much better. \n\nGrimalidi is a decent pie but just doesn't have the authentic Italian magic which Otto has. The crust was doughy and dry, the cheese tasteless and clumpy, the sauce was fine. Lastly, the ambiance at Otto is much better than Grimaldi.\n\nPrices are the same at both places, so no reason not to check out Otto"
0,"I was about to get new tires but this store would put the new tires on because 3 of the rims had a tiny crack on them. So they made it feel like had to get new rims & tires no matter what. I talked to their manager Bill the next day, he wasn't understanding at all. He said I could've just walked away and drove home with my damaged rims. I wish that they were more clear on what my options were. And when I asked about their return policy, he told me he can only give me half credit back for the new rims. My advice, just be aware of what your options are and don't get suckered by them on having to spend more money."
0,"Serving food like this should be a crime. In theory, fat sandwich could have worked. They could have served good, greasy, creative food, and I would have been all over that like a fly on shit. Instead, all the flies on shit you'll find here are just the ones crawling around their kitchen.\n\nThe basic idea of a fat sandwich is that you take all this prepackaged frozen finger food and pile it into a sandwich of your choosing, such that you can get fried mac and cheese, tater tots, french fries, hamburger patties, gyro meat, mozzarella sticks, sausages, and chicken fingers all in one large, nasty sandwich.\n\nMy main problem with fat sandwiches is that they're serving you the same fried garbage that you could get for half the price in the freezer section at Sam's Club, except that they've somehow made it worse. They're using the lowest quality of ingredients available, and it is completely apparent upon the first bite you take.\n\nEvery single ingredient they use just tastes godawful. It doesn't really matter what you pick to put on your fat sandwich, because it will all taste the same. Again, let me emphasize, EVERY SANDWICH TASTES EXACTLY THE SAME. Combine that with the fact that they're serving this food in days-old rolls that have the taste and consistency of paper, and you just feel insulted. I got food of this quality inside my high school cafeteria, and I have no interest in suffering through it again.\n\nNow obviously, you have to be pretty inebriated to want a sandwich like that. Fat Sandwich Co knows that, and they play on that. This place loves to encourage self-destructive behavior like binge drinking and eating their sandwiches, and if it ever has customers inside, it's a group of loudmouthed frat boy stereotypes covered in their own vomit. But no matter how intoxicated I am, I will never ever make the mistake of eating at this hole ever again. The fact that we're all a bunch of alcoholic college students is not an excuse to serve us bad food.\n\nThe thing about us is that we're also as poor as we are irresponsible, which helps to remind you of how bad of a decision it is to go here. $8 for a fat sandwich. 8 fucking dollars for this shit. Then I can complement it with a $10 pack of cigarettes, in case I'm stupid enough to fall for your 50% upcharge. At least charge me what this garbage is worth, you sanctimonious assholes."
0,"By far, the least impressive Cirque du Soleil show I have seen.  The performers are all amazing, but for some reason, it was not showcased or directed well.\n\nWe spent over $130 on each ticket, and we had excellent seats, which were very comfortable, But the show seem to drag on.  The sand artist was really cool and different."
1,"Mondays has a Taste of Italy theme for dinner. Choice range from salads, appetizers, Italian sub sandwiches, soups, entrees like Osso Bucco Gremolata, pizza, carving station, and desserts.\n\nThe Osso Bucco was delicious. It was meaty and roasted to perfection. The bone marrow was the best part, creamy and rich with flavor from the bone. Definitely go for second and thirds on this one. Thumbs up!\n\nChilled on ice, peel and eat shrimp (all that your heart desires) with cocktail sauce for dipping. You'll pay at least twice as much for a seafood buffet on the Strip that includes shrimp. Thumbs up!\n\nThe seafood paella (which is more Spanish than Italian) was chocked full of squid and mussels. It's a simple dish but packed full of flavor. The seafood itself flavored the rice with the green onion and bay leaf as support. Definitely worth a second trip! Thumbs up!\n\nLast, but not least, the desserts bar. They had some of their staples of mini \u00e9clairs, mini fruit tarts, cakes and pies. But since it was Italian-themed, cannolis were on the menu. The pastry shells were perfectly baked. The cheese filling was sweet, but a bit too thick and heavy. The chocolate chips made it more decadent and delicious. Go for seconds, if you have room. Thumbs up!"
0,I talked my family in to going there for my birthday. I am one of those people who can eat anything with out getting sick. This place did the trick! I was sick for 24 hours. If you take the fryer out of that restaurant they won't be able to cook at all. Even the dinner roll saw the inside of the deep fryer! I so wanted it to be good. Very sad it wasn't!
0,"Dasi R at gate B14 was so obnoxious and rude!  An out and out bitch!

It was as though I wad asking her for her kidney!!! Whatever...."
0,A few rude staff members have made me not want to go back. I started going to pink spot since grand opening.
0,Ordered steak fajitas which were very tough. Both the side servings of retried beans and rice were bland.  Overall there was a lack of favor as it seems their recipes do not allow for some spices.  A little cumin in the beans would make a huge difference   The rice was the most bland.  The  quantity was great but this is no trip to flavor town.
0,"Food was ok, but the main issue I had is the restaurant is NOT kid-friendly as it purports to be. There is gratuitous use of curse words on the menu and displays through the restaurant."
0,"Very disappointed. Returned home to 6 damaged items from blatant rough housing and rushing including broken items, gash in wall, two instances of significantly  scraped furniture. Some of which were \""hidden\"" strangely, none were reported. Furniture was all crooked, valances left every which way (however vacuum attachment must have left them), shower heads changed and facing OUT of shower (found that out the hard way), lights unplugged, stereo settings changed, child safety outlets removed, two pieces of mysterious broken glass found on floor. I understand that things happen but all together this is a bit much!"
1,"This is one of my favorite hawaiian fusion restaurant. I love the regular menu and the happy hour menu,. For the regular menu you may want to try to order the  sampler it has 3 types of meats, that will give you a taste of what Roy's is all about. I had my birthday celebration here and they make you feel really special with a special menu greetings for your birthday or whatever occasion it may be. Then a photographer comes to take yoru picture to capture your dining experince,.If you did not want to dine in the regular price menu they have an awesome happy hour menu from 5-8pm half off appetizers, fanging from 2-5 dollars. way awesome to relax after work and chat with your freinds in the lounge. Love this place and would highhly reccomend it!"
1,"Who knew gin and tonics and mussels are so good together! We highly recommend getting that when you go here. \n\nWe didn't have much else so I can't comment too much on the place. \n\nWe had set our stuff down at a table and never saw a waiter so we assumed we had to order at the bar. I left my purse on a chair and went two steps away to the bar and magically a waitress appeared straightening chairs. Well..she joked that my purse was at one of her tables, but I got the distinct vibe I should move my bag. So...we sat at the bar and had a great time. The bartender was super friendly, I think his name was Michael.\n\nPoop on you angry waitress lady! \n\nPoop on you."
1,"My all time favorite @SBC is 'Raspberry Mocha Kiss' - A Classic Mocha with the addition of raspberry.  Plus, they never forget to give you a piece of dark chocolate stick on the side :)  It can be a little too sweet for some people, but as long as you don't drink everyday,, why not having one??\nHonestly, I don't want to count how many calories in my coffee or latte :)  I'm pretty sure that if my friends are reading my review, she or he will say \"" the wrong choice of coffee can easily sabotage your weight loss plans, J.

1,"Exceptional service. 5 stars all the way, waiters knew the menu and were very friendly. I highly recommend the rabbit, and lobster ravioli. The fact we had an option to order small portions (Tapas) and were able to try more then one meal (four each to be exact) was phenomenal. When visiting Vegas please stop by and try it out. Being italian and raised around good food, here and in Italy, I am very particular with my Italian food and for myself to recommend an Italian restaurant is extremely rare. A+"
0,"Stopped in with a friend for lunch. The lunch special prices ($7.99) were what really lured us in the door. It was a sadly mediocre experience.\n\nYou get a lot of food for your money, which I was excited about. But when I started eating my Pad Fresh Ginger, I noticed the flavors were all over the place. One bite was way too salty, another bite was funky. The quality of the chicken seemed to be pretty good, and was plentiful. But overall, it just tasted unpleasant and was very greasy. The lunch special came with a cup of soup and an egg roll. The soup tasted fine, but was only sparsely adorned with vegetables. The eggroll was a greasy, bland little nugget.\n\nMy friend ordered the Ka Pow, which was equally greasy and underwhelming. \n\nOur server was fine, and the space was inviting enough. Too bad the food was pretty forgettable. I would not recommend this place."
1,"I adore this Native! The food is good (especially the cheese sticks), the drinks are reasonably priced (plus they have happy hour/reverse happy hour specials everyday), and there are at least a dozen tvs to watch games on. What really keeps me coming in is the bartenders! Mike, Yvette, and Camry are on point all day, everyday!"
1,"I love this place. It's great for a quick meal if you're shopping or if you work in the area and are on lunch break. \n\nI HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend the Chopped Turkey salad. I get it a couple times a week and with very good reason:\n\nPerfectly portioned and well-priced, it's filled with chopped turkey, Vermont Cheddar, hard-boiled eggs, crispy lettuce, cherry tomatoes and corn. I prefer it with the Cowboy Ranch dressing, but there's also a vinaigrette option. All that for just under $6!\n\nI've gotten the sliders a couple times - they are delish and sized just right for what they are. I know if I am craving a big juicy burger, I can go hit up Johnny Rocket's in the mall, or better yet Five Guys when it opens!\n\nThis was a great concept and it's very nice that it's not trying to be something it's not. Take-out is obviously what the aim is here, as seating is limited."
1,"Found myself on the Westside and of course had to sample some well reviewed and well rated Pho! This is very nice Pho and fortunately for me I have four I ranked slightly higher that are closer to me in the East Valley, as this is very far to go for Pho. VERY nice broth, lots of meat (although a couple of pieces were a little tough) served by the little Vietnamese Lady who obviously is responsible for its delicate flavor. Beats out lots of very well regarded \""Pho Joints,\"" quite handily. Nice surprise and very close to my #3 ranked Pho Phind!"

I also suggest you pay with cash*\n\n*A few girls I know got hit with an $8000 tab after a couple bottles of Ace of Spades appeared on their table (likely the dumb-ass promoter). They signed for an expected $1,600 tab that Sunday (plenty for four girls) and then got the $8,000 rude awakening the next day - I don't know think Maya ever refunded this. \n\nYES! Eight Thousand Dollars!"

1,"If you want great steaks and don't want to break the bank, this is the place. Located inside the Silverton Casino, this cozy room has a great bar and a reasonably price menu. Order a la cart or off the Classics Menu (comes with salad and 2 sides).\n\nA few go to favorites are:\nBourbon BBQ Bone-in ribeye\nPrime rib\nBeef carpaccio (eat it with the Lavash that comes in the bread basket-YUM!)\n\nI've never tried it, but they also have a tapas menu and its half price during happy hour! They also have a live band on some nights."

1,"After leaving the restaurant, I was pretty dead-set on giving this place a three-star rating.  But as the days passed, Mily & Lalo was on my mind...\n\nI can hear a faint whisper in the air: mi mi mi, ly ly ly... la la la, lo lo lo.  That's when the mescaline was in full effect.  But I had to have it... you see, I was craving the bread.  That delicious world-rockin' yucca bread.  It tastes like a donut.at.its.m-fing.core.  So good.  When you take a bite of it (and dip a piece in the spicy ambrosia-esque sauce), you'll know what I'm talking about.  Some say exaggeratiion reeks of sarcasm, this, my friends - the bread - smells of the truth.  Abandon religion - find the bread.\n\nCeviche's okay.\n\ndmo out"
0,"I was disappointed after dining here for a Sunday happy hour. The bar area was crowded and loud so my party decided to try to sit at a table on the patio. The outside table had not been wiped down thoroughly and there were a few flies swarming around so we decided to wait for a table to open up in the bar/lounge area so that we could order from the happy hour menu. \n\nWe ordered the calamari, which was probably the best item we tried but was not that impressive compared to many others in the area. We also ordered the cheeseburger sliders which were too pink, and the fiery shrimp and crab crunch rolls which were just ok but nothing special. \n\nOur food was delivered before we received plates, so we had to get up and ask the bartender to provide some for us.  And our server, who was rushing around did not return to ask how our food turned out or if we would like to order anything else. \n\nI don't plan on returning here."

0,"We used to love this place.  But everything has changed  - except the decor.  Tonight my wife tried the Kalua Pig sandwich.  What arrived was pork jerky on a toasted bun.  The menu said it came with pineapple, but it was a 60 degree wedge, about 1/4 inch thick.  They forgot to bring the fries she also ordered, but sent for them immediately - before she tasted the pork.  When the fries came, she sent the pork back.  They apologetically asked if there was something else they could bring her. She wanted a Chinese Chicken salad we used to order, but it was removed from the menu 2 weeks ago, so she settled for the Chicken Caesar.  It was not bad.  I ordered the special - a roast beef on ciabatta, but the ciabatta was over-toasted rye instead.  We informed them that their recent changes were not an improvement, and we wouldn't be back.  They offered to take 15% off the check, and it took 3 attempts for them to finally get it right.  Unbelievable!  I had to wonder just how bad they wanted my yelp comment to be."

1,"Wow, first of all, I'm from Socal and I didn't expect to find a gem of a sushi joint like this in vegas.\n\nDidn't feel like paying big bucks for overrated pricey sushi joints on the strip, so we decided to hit this place up as a recommendation from a friend.\n\nI was blown away by how many items they had on their AYCE menu. Suppppper thrilled to order every single item possible to try.\n\nTheir nigiri was superb because the fish was really fresh and sweet. The best has to be the white tuna! The sweet shrimp and uni definitely had to be my favorite, and it sucked that you can only order it once.\n\nAll their rolls were very unique and each one satisfied my tastebuds. The best part was that they allowed half orders on the rolls, so you can try more!\n\nThe icing on the cake was the selection of ice cream at the end. From tempura, to mochi, to red bean... It was heaven\n\nCan't wait to come back to Vegas in 2 weeks and hit up this spot again. BEST AYCE sushi I've ever had, and that's coming a lot from someone who's had multiple hot spots in socal. \n\nTHUMBS WAY UP"
0,Food is mediocre and staff will argue with you.  I ordered a burger that stated had American cheese on it and I asked for cheddar.  The server then said they only have cheddar but she would make sure. My burger finally came out and it had American cheese it. My friend got a different sandwich and had cheddar cheese in it. I ended up eating it dissatisfied because another server asked if I was ok because I wasn't eating it at all. I explained my issue with him as well and he argued with me about how they don't have American cheese. I pulled the cheese off of my friends sandwich to show the difference he proceeded to argue but said he'd take it back. I refused because I don't like to send food back. Nevertheless they took it off the bill.
0,"So, here's the lowdown on chop and wok!!\nDo you go for the food? No, while it's not awful it's just very average. Very heavy and thick loaded w MSG.\nDo you go for the service? No. We waited 10 minutes at our table and nobody acknowledged us. So, you ask the bartender and he will say \""I will find someone to help you\""\nDo you go for ambience? No, it's let's say \""eclectic\"" and if you look around the place is dirty.\nSo why go? Well, it was a group of 6 of us and we had a good time. You know what to expect there, not much. But it's has a good tap beer selection, it's not pricey and you know you can't be critical of this establishment.\nIt is what it is!!!"
1,"We had a wonderful experience from start to finish!! Our tour guide was awesome!! We were celebrating a friends 50th birthday and it was a great time!!! The food price was reasonable, the food was great and the entire group (25 people) enjoyed every minute of it!! What a fun and unique way to experience downtown!"
1,"Visited Anthony's Steakhouse this weekend for our anniversary.  Made our reservation through Yelp and had no issue. When we arrived.\n\nWe shared the prosciutto salad which was perfect for 2 and I had a special Buffalo Surf and Turf while my wife had a bone in filet.  Both were very well done.  The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the cheddar and bacon stuffed tater tots.  Wasn't that great.\n\nWe did really enjoy our bottle of wine and with 30% off, it was $30. Nice.\n\n\nOverall, it was a very good dinner.  Just not the cheapest. Worth it though for a special occasion and its not as crowded as the strip."
1,"Massive Selection of drinks designed to ruin your abilities to reason! I came across Red Horse Beer, which I havn't seen since my trips overseas. My friend also at the same moment came across Estrella Damm, which is not easy to find. There wine selection is diverse and abundant. (They shelf my concorde grape wines)! For such a large place, much is easy to find, and the rows are labeled to assist in your search. The staff is friendly, and the environment is clean. Lastly, the booze chilling machines they have are awesome! These neat gizmos allow you to take home your purchase cold in a matter of minutes to experience immediate inebriation! 5 Stars! Would give 6 if I could for shelving my concorde grape wine and Youngs Chocolate Beer in abundance: )"
1,"On our stay at the Venetian, we decided to try this steak house one night.\nI had the ribeye and my wife went for the filet mignon. Both steaks were absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. The server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu .\nFor the desert we opted to share the bread pudding,and I have to say it is one of the best I have ever eaten.\nVery good experience overall!"
0,The prepared food section has gone downhill since my first review.  Twice I've been here on recent trips and I have noticed two trends:\n\n1.  Less variety.\n2.  Freshness has suffered.  I don't really want prepared food that has a crust I need to break through and push to the side.  Yuk.
0,"We sit there in our Vegas hotel (my cousins and me) ...\n\nIt's been over an hour and a half, it's about 2 in the morning and we're  not hungry anymore. When we almost lose our appetite, the pizza finally arrives.\n\n\""That'll be 9 bucks.\""\nMy cousin gives a twenty.\n\""I'm sorry but I don't have change.\""\n\nAren't these delivery peeps supposed to be ready and have extra change?\n\nWe just slammed the door in his face and ate the pizza, which was mediocre tasting. Never again. DON'T GET FLAMINGO PIZZA!!"
0,"Yes, the place is inexpensive, and let's just say, you get what you pay for.  The last couple of times that I was there, I was assigned to the same stylist.  She never paid much attention to what she was doing.  She was too busy checking into everyone's conversations and looking at the door for customers entering.  Needless to say, I had very uneven haircuts after both visits.  Another stylist that I had at one time, overcharged me $5 extra for a product that I purchased.  Unfortunately, I didn't learn this until I returned home later on in the day.  I know of other people from my area who have experienced similar problems with this neighborhood salon.  Inexpensive, coupon, or not, I don't plan to return to this place."
1,"BOY!!!! This place is off the chain. Open 24 hours? Man you can't beat that. I simply LOVE this place. Why the 4 stars you ask, well for one thing I really didn't like their pastrami fries and yes it was enough to bump it down one star. For one thing I strongly believe that if a business/restaurant deserves 5 stars, you better believe that everything they serve and their customer service is top notch. And I failed to believe everything on the menu was good, but you better believe that their philly cheese steaks are probably the best I've tried in LV and in the Bay Area.\n\nThe first time I was here I ordered the philly cheese steak with bacon and swiss #9. It was just as good as advertised and just as good as it looked while the cook was making it. I also ordered the cheese whiz fries and boy was that also yummy. I also ordered fried 'shrooms, and those little mouth watering bites were simply just awesome. It was the first time I tried anything mushroom fried in batter, and I was damn glad this place was my first. The second time I ate here I ordered the pizza philly cheese steak.....mmmmm, was that yummy it was like ordering on of my two favorite things and smashing it into one nice juicy hoagie. I also ordered cheese whiz fries again, but this time I had the master cook add some bacon in it, man was that good.\n\nIf I really had more time to spend in Las Vegas, I sure would come here a few more times and try more off the menu. I also love the fact that this place is open 24 hours. With me being on Vegas party time and coming home about 3 or 4 in the morning after the casino, this place just becomes a savior.\n\nThank goodness for Pops Philly Steaks open 24 hours and its yummy juicyness of flavorful cheeeeeeese steaks. Keep up the good work guys, when I'm back in town you better believe I'll be back for more! It's like philly cheese steaks from heaven. YUM!"
1,"Hannah & Natasha, the two 20-something bartenders, are incredible bartenders! They give great service and make everyone feel welcome. 5 stars!"
0,"I've tried contacting them over the phone and even through text as the phone message suggests and I have not yet received a reply. Even if they don't have the availability I need, I don't see why they can't respond through text to say when their next availability is. If I could give zero stars I would. I called and texted them at 10:30am today and it is now 10:45pm. Still no response. I have had zero luck on even speaking with someone at this business. I had high hopes for this place since it got good reviews."
0,"Ok this place does not even deserve a star! But I guess I have to in order to tell you guys to stay away!! Hmm, where should I start?? First of all front office staff is rude and very disrespectful. When my friend and our husbands walked up to the front desk they didn't even smile and it took them forever to give us our room key. They all kind of just stand around and play on their phones. Very sloppy. Also, one of the girls was just staring at both of our husbands right in front of us!! I don't mean like just glancing a couple of times, full on staring!! Kind of creepy and very disrespectful. So I give that office staff two thumbs down. \n\n\n\nOk moving on to the casino part of it. I had an incident in the bathrooms down in the very small, crappy casino. I walked into a stall in the bathroom and as soon as I sat down a GUY walks into it. Yep a MAN walks into the girls bathroom. I stayed quiet because I was pretty scared. He walks into the stall right next to me and starts peeing. He then walks to the sink to wash his hands and for some reason he washed them twice. He then walked over to the towel dispenser (which was right in front of my stall) and peeks through my stall door!! He then throws away his paper towel and peeks in again! This time a little longer. Omg it still gives me the chills even today!! I was shooken up for a while after that. So the Casino and the people are very shady!! \n\nNow to the rooms. The rooms had a pretty cute lay out but our room stunk like mold BADLY!! And the beds were super gross. I had a few bug bites on my legs the next day!  \n\n\nThe shuttle service was ridiculous because it only ran until 10. So after that you are screwed and either have to walk back or wait for a cab. They were also late a couple times picking us up. \n\n\nPeople say you get what you pay for but to me, it would be a waste of 1 penny. Sorry guys but this to me is a NO GO!!"
0,"The 2 problems with this buffet are the lack of transparency about their prices & dining hours & the over hype about their food. Do they post their prices & hours for lunch, dinner? NO. Can you believe the yelp reviews here? NO\nMy partner & I read the reviews & had dinner here Thursday Sept 28. We used our Total Rewards card & the bill for the 2 of us with tax was over $82. Reviews mostly don't know what they talking about. 1 review here said beer & wine complimentary with dinner. No, not true. Other review said they have 3 types of crab with even separate section for claws. No, not true. The crab legs are OK but were kind of salty. The salad selection is lacking in variety. Most small portions are OK. The staff is friendly. Bottom line: would we come back? NO"
0,"I'm freakin' DONE with this place. \nEvery time I come here I get above-average food (good!) with poor service (bad!) \nLast time I was here our server never came back to pick up our check and it took so long that i had to get up and go looking for someone else to get us some change. \nThis time I ordered the soup-and-half-sandwich plate. I was offered chicken noodle or French onion. I went with the onion. When the check came, I was charged extra for the soup. When my server came back to pick up my card (and she took a LONG time to come back around and wasn't even the same server as the time before... is this protocol at this restaurant?) she said \""oh, yeah, that soup costs extra.\"" Interesting, as the surcharge isn't noted on the menu and as a former server myself, I know I should have been told about this when given the choices. \nI won't lie: the food is pretty hearty. But is it worth the flippant service?"
1,"I attended a birthday party at AZ Air Time this past weekend and was pleasantly surprised by how clean it was and how much fun my 2 year old son had jumping around with his friends.  \n\nThe facility is huge and includes a 5000 square foot main trampoline, separate jump areas based on age, 2 dodgeball courts, party areas, a snack bar, a foam pit, and a ton more... Luckily, there were a handful of staff members working, but none of them were supervising the kids, so make sure you have a 1:1 adult to kid ratio if your kid(s) are at the age where they need supervision.  \n\nWhile the party had our own area blocked off, there was another party going on in the same area, so it was a tad bit chaotic, but a blast for the kids.  They brought in NYPD Pizza and I'm pretty sure the hostess brought in her own fruit, veggies, cake and goodie bags.\n\nIf you're looking for somewhere to burn off some energy, or for your kids to play, this is definitely a great option - as long as you plan on supervising!  Be prepared to sign your life away before you jump as well - waivers are required!"
0,"I had a Groupon voucher for this restaurant, and I went with my husband. I thought the burger was okay, but my husband was not happy. The bun is almost three times the size of the patty. The toppings? Most of them are actually sauces, not toppings. \n\nIf we had to choose between Cheeburger Cheeburger or Harvey's, we'd pick Harvey's. Cheeburger was also pretty expensive. We got nothing extra at all, not even a beverage and it was still about $25.00. \n\nWe were placed right by the door and it was freezing each time someone opened the door to come in or leave (although it wasn't all that busy). \n\nNot a great experience and we won't go back again. Sorry Cheeburger Cheeburger!"
1,"Nice park with lots of stuff for the kids. Playground, water feature, big open field, picnic area, and lake with waterfalls, ducks, geese, and turtles."
0,"Regarding THE BUFFET, I was impressed with it when I was there in November, therefore I made it a point to return. Boy, do I regret it. It was totally disappointing. The staff was not friendly, they actually had attitude...the food was horrible, and the presentation was horrible. It was sloppy and dirty. I spoke to a manager and complained about the guy at the carving station. When he finally decided to return to his station (from the back) he didnt utter a word and helped the lady behind me, when I was first in line. All of their attitudes suck, and they act as if they hate their jobs. NEWS FLASH: TO ALL BUFFET EMPLOYEES WORKING THE LINE...If customers like us dont frequent the buffet, you wouldnt have a job!!  something to think about! The only nice person I came across was Ray behind the dessert bar, he was friendly, and actually enjoyed his job. Ray you can do better than that, find another hotel/casino that will appreciate you!"
0,"Maybe it's because my friends and I were there earlier in the night, the place was filled with an older crowd, and wasn't full. We came here to get a stamp to get into XS for free which turned out to be a bust, but that's alright. The music was what you get anywhere you go. A mix of top 40 and house. The drinks were watered down but I guess you can't really complain when they're free. \n\nThe main reason for the low rating is because I could not get over the fact that the entire place smelled DISGUSTING! There is a problem when the bathroom of a place smells better than the actual place."
1,We went here a couple of times for a late afternoon glass of wine and snack.  We sat outside on one occasion and sat at the bar on another occasion.  Service was pleasant and efficient.  We found the ambiance and experience to be relaxing and a nice way to pass some time and have a light bite.  There were lots of interesting wine selections by the glass.  We would visit again.
1,Very friendly staff and delicious meals. The only problem is that is high on fat and you have to wait 15-20 mins to start eating. The banana nut muffin is overrated. If you check in with foursquare you can get the muffin for free.
0,Think twice before choosing this location and company. Only two agents at the desk with over 20 customers waiting.\nOnly one person at the car checkout. Waited more than 1.5 hours.\nNot much else to do so why not yelp about it .\nGet it together Hertz!!!
1,"I had the beef taco and cheese enchilada combo with beans and rice. The beans and rice were pretty standard. The cheese enchilada was quite cheesy and tasty. The beef taco was just OK, but that's partly my fault. I was expecting ground beef, but you have to specifically ask for it, so the next time I will go in I'll try that."
0,"Came for an authentic Cuban experience. The food was bland, fried with minimal sauce. The staff was friendly and the mojito gave me a quick buzz, but I would not return."
0,Us airways is horrible.  Their stewardesses are more concerned with their cell phones than anything else. As the plane was landing people were. Standing in the aisles.  I had a connecting flight but they would not call the gate or do anything to help.  Ran all the way to the gate only to have the person at the desk say too late. Too bad.  I will not fly us air again.
0,"The only thing I liked about this sushi bar was the size.  It is very large.  Custom rolls were weak, freshness was questionable and the price was way to high.  Have not been back."
0,"I read below that this restaurant is a great place to take your mom out for breakfast... so hey, I listened, and decided it'd be worth a try. My mom and I headed out Sunday morning to grab a nice meal and catch up. Well unless your idea of bringing mom out to breakfast is causing her to have an aneurysm then this isn't the place for you. Look, I'm patient, but when I walked into a restaurant and try to simply put my name on the waitlist and get shoved aside by other patrons, that's strike 1. When the manager and his five unhelpful staff of chickens run around like their heads are cut off, that also worries me. Does it really take 6 people to man the front of the restaurant -- and by man I mean disregard customers? Glad I walked out before being sat down because I'm sure the kitchen is in as much disarray as the entrance."
0,"I went once because I live real close, and wanted mexican food. Unfortunately, I will not be going back because it was not good. I got a burrito and it was doused in oil, it was just terrible. I did not even finish it, because it was causing an upset stomach. Maybe I just chose the wrong dish, but that dish caused me to not wanna go back."
1,"If you walk in from the west parking garage into the casino. There's a Fortunes menu  at the door, can't miss it. This is how I found out they had specials with your player's card. Must present your card to the server.  We constantly get comps each month for the Dim Sum but I doubt I'll ever use them. \n\nThey have two menus here, Fortunes & Dim Sum menu.\n\nOn Tuesday the Shrimp Fried Rice is $7.99, I have tried their Sweet & Sour Chicken for $9.99. Really delicious food. I have not tried the Dim Sum menu because I'm not very adventurous. I just stick to what I know.\n\nThe service in here is consistent, the food comes out hot & fresh. We've had one issue but we mentioned it to our waitress and she took care of it immediately.  Happy yelping everyone. :D"
1,"Pop em bottles son!! I really enjoyed this place and thought it was a good value.  It's not as drop dead gorgeous as XS, but the place is a bit easier to get into and the huge patio is quite stunning.  We got a table with 3 bottles for very reasonable price.  If you like hip hop, this is the place to be.  The crowd was ok.. i always make sure to bring my own crowd so I usually have fun anywhere we end up.  I'd definitely come back.  I actually prefer this place to Marquee (over-rated in my opinion)."
1,Always fresh and hot. Service is good . This is our favorite pizza location. What's not to love???
0,"Their food is really bland, no flavor at all! Overpriced for tasteless food! A whole in the wall place with tasteless food!"
0,"Eh.  It's alright.  Worth checking out, but I won't be going back.\n\nWe parked in the metered area, and I remember thinking \""2 hours max - damn.\""  Going in, I assumed we'd have to leave and park somewhere else after our time expired.  We were out of there in about 90 minutes, and that includes waiting forever to get some grub.\n\nThe entire footprint is small.  And cramped.  The design is nice, but I don't feel like logistics were considered very well.  The bathrooms are a joke - super tiny and hard to find.  Lines for the various eateries were extended out in the path of travel.  The play area in the center is nice, but already filthy and not well maintained in general.\n\nThere are several decent places to eat.  There is also live music which was nice.  Definitely a \""cool\"" concept that works well in theory, but, as executed, I just don't think it will work out.\n\nP.S. I fully expect that this place will receive a slew of 1 star reviews by people visiting in the months of May-October.  It will be way too hot to enjoy anything the place has to offer, especially considering there are no shaded areas and very limited seating within a few eateries."
0,"Skanky hotel jammed in the meat and potatoes of the strip.  The Bellagio, Paris, Ceasars, etc flank this run-down Reno-style casino.  \n\nBut this is where I began my Vegas runs, posing as an older member of the human race.  You can grab $2 blackjack.  And I believe my friends and I played 8 hrs of straight $1 craps when I just turned legal age...to smoke."
1,"located in treasure island - a great place for dinner before the 7pm mystere show because they open at 4:30pm.  started off with a pitcher of margaritas.. done right!  the guacamole was fresh and tasty.   all of us had the fajitas (2 veggie and 2 chicken) and loved them!  i had the vegetarian fajitas - bell peppers, onions, and other veggies.  got them \""alambre style\"", which is topped with melted cojita cheese.. so good and worth it!   the best thing, by far, was the kahlua creme brulee!  don't pass it up!  all in all, a good dinner and conveniently located a few steps away from the mystere theatre!"
1,"Rio is a solid 4 star hotel, nice big rooms, clean, lots of good places to eat, big sports book, cocktail waitresses in the upper tier, if you know what I mean."
0,This is frozen reheated Chinese at best. I can't believe other reviews saying it's the best Chinese they've ever had. I've had better Chinese samples at Costco. Nice atmosphere. Looks like a nice bar. Waitress was nice. Just don't eat the food.
1,"I was in town on business and wanted a nice lunch for one while avoiding a chain restaurant.  I stopped in after 1:30pm (no waiting) and had a great turkey sandwich, tomato soup, and one amazing biscuit.  Not sure how long they have been in business, but would love to see one of these in Chicago.  They ran out of decaf coffee, but gave me a soda  water for free.  Nice decor too."
1,Right down the street.  I needed a fast battery for my car and they were quick and friendly.  Great job.
0,"We tried the cheese curds because we told they were among the best in town.  The might be, if you like lots of breading with bits of cheese. \n\nThe portobello sandwich had to be marinated in salt.  The mozzarella on it was dry and lacked any flavor. With all the salt you wouldn't be able to taste it anyway.\n\nThe chicken salad sandwich....the filling was minimal, the toasted bread was brushed (soaked) in butter. \n\nThe Rubin was tough and hard to eat.  The 4th person in our group ordered the bbq pork sandwich. He said it was good but certainly not worth coming back for.  Our water glasses were never refilled. Over all it is a thumbs down for all of us.   \n\nAs a positive the sweet potato fries were good."
0,"Terrible service. The food was decent, but not great. Ordered our food and then didn't see our waitress again for another forty five minutes. The other staff was not helpful when we asked for refills or Parmesan and we eventually had to ask for the management just to get some refills. Would not recommend."
0,"I was so excited to try Urban Picnic. I walked in and could tell they were short staffed right away. The girl behind the register was also the runner for the food so she was alternating back and forth. Dark clouds on the horizon. \n\nConstructive criticism: They need to invest in a large version of their menu, simply stapling their paper Togo menu to the wall was confusing and hard to read. Choose a different corner to cut.\n\nI ordered the veggie pressed sandwich and the kids Mac n' cheese. My friend ordered a salad and a kids meal as well. Her food came out in 20 minutes, and mine was FAR behind. 35 minutes later, my \""hot pressed\"" sandwich came out completely cold in the middle. Disappointing and gross. I went to refill my ice tea, they were out. Bummer. I didn't even eat the sandwich, and left hungry. \n\nAll signs of my experience point to simply being under staffed. I saw a total of three humans trying to man this sinking ship. Based on the previous reviews, it seems like this was a fluke. Hopefully."
1,"Loved, LOVED this place. Loved the vibe, to start. The cocktails, to continue. The food, to end. \n\nHad the arancini, fried artichokes, grilled octopus, panzanella salad, beet salad, wedge salad, foie gras, 2 steaks, scallops and tried 4 desserts. \n\nOK, I didn't do that on my own, but so what?? \nAlso they have an entire list of 50 wines (bottles) under $50. Who DOES that in Vegas??? No one, I tell you. \n\nI was so excited I wrote about it twice: http://blogs.laweekly.com/squidink/2013/02/las_vegas_steak_restaurant_bar.php \n\nand with more pics here: http://www.eattalk.net/2013/02/postcard-from-las-vegas.html#.USfVZOgRQtU\n\nI will definitely be back to this place as soon as I return to Vegas. Don't pay any attn to the sketchy hotel in which it resides. It's fabulous. A Must-do."
1,Love the good egg! Been going for about ten years and this our new fav location. Dependable deliciousness by friendly staff. Yay!
1,"Dropped off my cousin here for their flight to California. The parking is not a hassle and a lot of things has changed since I remembered back in high school. Everything was under construction, caution tape everywhere, and just looked unappealing. Taking the time to actually tour around the place it is pretty nice and impressive. You got a variety of stores, lounging areas, and of course the restaurants. Very nice because it is still improving and still building more restaurants there. \n\nThe baggage and check in stations are very easy to do and don't need much help. That is a big part for me because airports can be very busy so the less time checking in the better. So, overall, I'd have to say even though I haven't been to a lot of airports Sky Harbor by far has to be one of the best in categories ranging from being clean, exceptional service, and having a variety of stores/restaurants."
1,"The staff here is awesome, especially at the bar! We asked the chef about what she put in the empanadas to make them so great; she was super nice and personable, not to mention forthcoming. \n\nEven though I really like Fuego Bistro (same owners), I have to admit all the food here really has that extra something (maybe it's the chef? Hells ya.) Also, the decor and ambiance at Tacos caters to a more trendy, urban customer. Tacos is more polished, slightly funky, and modern; whereas the bistro is a more traditional Caribbean-style place. \n\nI love their Sangrias, especially the red one. Still the spiced pear sangria is very interesting. It doesn't taste exactly like what you'd expect, but worth a try. \n\nRECOMMENDATION: Come for their happy hour and TRY EVERYTHING!"
1,I don't see a listing for the North location (8820 University East) but that is the location I am reviewing. Tasha is excellent.  Highly recommend! Very professional and I always leave happy. My husband tagged along and got his haircut just once before he too decided Tasha is the best in town.
1,"If your're looking for a country breakfast, this is the place!\n\nEggs the way you like them.\nThey serve up a great cup of coffee and an excellent country breakfast.\nThey serve breakfast till 11am.\n\nThey have a good lunch menu too.\nThe Greek salad is one of the best I've ever had.\nBurgers, Cheese Steaks and sandwiches.\n\nThey also have real good sweet tea!\nServing since 1957."
0,Went for a quick lunch and sat at the bar. Toasted turkey Sandwich overwelming tasted like butter.  Also 2.50 for a club soda with no lime straight from the gun is a pet peeve of mine. On top of that I took three sips just to wash the butter taste from my mouth cause it was bad.  I can have a 18 dollar lunch anywhere and I think I will try somewhere else next time I'm in surprise
0,"Brunch is not good here. Stick to baked goods. Quiche was so cold in the middle, had to be either frozen or stored in refrigerator for very long time. Not anywhere close to freshly made. Croque Monsieur also pretty sad, thin slices of lunch meat style ham, soggy bread and pretty bland all things considered. The coffee is also deplorable, tasting of ash, turpentine, and a touch of tar. Service was pretty good though."
1,I had the Lamb Chops and oh boy!!! It was wonderful. My lady had the fish and once again it was delicious. Bobby Flay is a guru when it comes to sauces.
1,"Carlos is the one man running the show at this location and it's important for you to get to know him -- He is very kind and hooks people up all the time -- TIP HIS ASS! -- The only down side to this place is that their are only 5 stools to sit on -- It's more-so for carry out -- I'd highly suggest getting a carne asada burrito with carne asada, rice, and cheese only inside the burrito -- This place is 10x better than Roberto's and no where near as greasy -- I like to get the TROPICAL TEA from the gas station section it's right beside this place inside LOOK FOR IT"
1,We used Alex last weekend to help coordinate a great night at XS at Encore. Alex was so great to work with and made the entire process very easy. All we had to do was show up and Alex already had everything set up for us. We are so thankful we found Alex and Vegas Guy VIP. It definitely made our trip that much better and we'd recommend Alex and Vegas Guy VIP to anyone headed to Vegas.
0,"I have been a member for almost 2 years and never had a problem with finding a group x class to fit my schedule or experienced over crowding in the main area. \n\nHowever, times have changed in the past 4 months. Zumba classes are becoming over-crowded. It is maxed out way over the building fire code and they don't enforce it. If you are in line early, it doesn't matter. You will get pushed back into the corner as people arrive late and crowd up the space. There are no ceiling fans and it gets hot and very humid and thick. They need to add more classes or enforce the \""limited space\"" and do first come, first serve. I don't pay a membership to not be able to access all the features and not get an effective workout.\n\nI left class early today because I had no where to move, I was bumping into people, couldn't see the instructor, and was feeling a heat stroke coming on, though I was properly hydrating myself. It was torture, not fun like it use to be. I wasn't even at the class that was at the busiest time of day!\n\nThe other day my friend had to leave because they were short staffed and the Kids Club was filled up. If it is during Zumba, you can guarantee it's going to be busy for kids too. They should have staffed the area properly.\n\nI feel my money would be best suited at a private studio rather than a gym."
1,"This place is a palace!\n\nI love the arena.  The banners of championship teams, retired numbers, and even the Montreal Expos retired numbers are awe inspiring.  There is also a picture of a Canadiens great above every section.  I was lucky enough to be sitting in the Jacques LeMaire area (Go Devils!).\n\nThe game I came to see was vs the Sabres and it was a 2-0 loss.  I really wanted to experience a goal, but it was a great game.  I had gotten myself a Brian Gionta (ex-Devil) jersey and rooted for the home team.\n\nThe concourse was huge, packed to the gills during intermissions.  Luckily the bathrooms were also huge and clean.  With enough places to go, it moved quickly.  The Molson was good, and the concessions were plentiful.  The place is always sold out from what I understand, and it looked amazing.\n\nIt was easily found from my hotel and a fairly short walk.  Just get your tickets early, I got mine on Stubhub and paid double, which I heard wasn't too bad.\n\nI cannot wait to go back!  Hopefully I can see a game vs the Devils, before Brodeur retires."
0,"This place was filled at one point (when it first opened- there was a sports store, an asian store, an ice cream place, a restaurant) and quickly became deserted- the rent must be really high. Plus, people did not really come through there to shop, anyway- jeez, retail suicide. There was a little stage in the middle where there would be some performances but I can't say that it was very professional. So, not surprisingly, the movie theater was affected, though this came about a few years later. \n\nI miss this closed movie theater the most in the whole center. It was a very nice movie theater with slightly discounted movie ticket prices and free parking- validated and had excellent sound. Clean facility, full staff. It as empty though. So, an announcement said the theater would close for renovations. A few days later on the news confirmed that it would be closing for good. So sad.\n\nI like downtown. In my many years in LV, I've never spent New Year's on the Strip (not crazy like that), but I have come to the Fremont Street Experience a couple times. I think that attraction has improved over the years. There are a few good restaurants in the area as well (aloha specialties, mickie finzz, the golden gate). But Neonopolis is an idea never realized- it didn't have a chance. The neon signs were really neat because it was a way to bring back a little something from the Old Vegas (you know, when people dressed up for no reason at all- like the old movies- suits, hats & dresses). Also, Jillian's was a cool little place but it closed and became something else (but don't know how that's going)."
1,"I love this studio. It's clean, the people are friendly, and the jewelry is awesome. I've gotten 14 piercings there and ridiculous amounts of jewelry. I wouldn't go anywhere else."
1,"We were in town on a business trip, and had the weekend to ourselves.  We took the train into Charlotte and walked around town looking for good places to eat.  Stumbled across BlackFinn and what a fantastic surprise! The bar was packed for the Panthers game, but we had no trouble getting a seat.  We shared Ying-Yang shirmp, which was half pound of crispy shrimp tossed in a sweet spicy asian sauce, garnished with sriracha on the side.  Wow, was this amazing! The MARGHERITA flat bread pizza had tomatoes, garlic butter, fresh mozzarella and basil and was absolutely delicious.  And words can not describe how wonderful the BLACKENED BRIE was, served warm with ciabatta toast,\nsliced apples and apricot cranberry chutney.  The bartender even brought us extra toast at no charge.  Our mission was to visit as many places as possible, and I wish now we had eaten a meal here, or come back again later in the week.  We visited 35 restaurants and bars in 12 days, and BlackFinn was in the top 3."
1,"I'm crazy about vegas and this place has all types of cool casino related stuff.  Very large chip collection and just all types of stuff, dice, tables, drink holders. chip holders, the list goes on and on.  If you are looking you that unique gaming room accessory this is the place.   Oh, they even give you free water.   Located southwest from fremont street, maybe a 5 min drive."
0,"I got a coupon for an oil change.  Talk about bait and switch.  It offered $19.95, but after giving me sort of ridiculous excuses, the charge for my beetle was going to be $39.95 !!!  And they said it used 8 qts of oil (I wonder where they would put it !!).  I guess their bankruptcy has inflated their costs....  I told them not to bother sending me coupons anymore and wasting my time."
1,"Seriously AWESOME.\n\nFirst time here, and it was GOURMET MEXICAN, just as advertised.\n\nEverything was fresh, spiced in unique and thoughtful ways, and presented very well.\n\nI had the RIBEYE.  If you are a carnivore, please eat this.  And thank me.\n\nOh my dear wonderful god it was tasty.  I ordered it medium rare and it was PERFECTION.\n\nThey really have taken some time and energy to make each dish distinctive.\n\nMy friend had the Ensalada with Cilantro y Pollo and it was such a surprising blend of so many different tastes.  The chicken had a GREAT chargrilled flavor and blended with all the other veggies.\n\nWe totally got suckered into ordering the sizzling ice cream dessert (I think it's just called apple pie on the menu, but my name is \""The Ice Cream SIZZLER\"".\n\nWe watched the table next to us get presented with this hot stone dish with some pastry + ice cream, and then the waiter poured some delicious sauce all over it, and that damn ice cream SIZZLED.\n\nSo sweet, but oh-so-tasty, and even the after dinner coffee was really soothing.\n\nI was so utterly satisfied by every aspect of this dining experience, I just hope they keep delivering!"
0,"An hour ago, I ordered online for pick-up.  I had used their: \nSpecial #3  X-Large Unlimited Toppings.  Being the extremely famished person I am, I ordered some garlic knots and  my pizza with:  \n\nBlack olives, buffalo chicken, feta cheese, meatballs, mushrooms, pepperoni, ricotta cheese, salami, sausage, and spinach.\n\nUpon entering the establishment, all I felt was warm sizzling air that Arizona is known for.  It would have been nice for customers and workers to have some AC going.  Anyways, I picked up my pizza and went home to devour it. \n\nMy review:  \n\n- The garlic knots, although extremely delicious on the outside, had no flavor whatsoever on the inside.  The garlic sauce they offer with it was extremely helpful as I had to drench the bread in the middle with it.   I must say though that I'm amazed at how flaky it is on the inside and warm and gooey on the inside.  Big brownie points!\n\n- The pizza itself was very interesting.  It seemed like they tossed all my toppings into the center so while working my way to the crust, I had a mouth-watering explosion of flavor!  Yum!  But like the garlic knots, the dough itself offered very little flavor.\n\nOverall, it wasn't bad for the price.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good.  It really seems like Gus is a water-downed cheaper alternative to NYPD Pizza!\n\nOh, and as a note, they charge 50cents if you use a credit card and a 49cents \""service fee.\""  I picked-up the pizza.  What service did I get?  XD"
1,I knocked off a star because of how small the location is. I have heard rumors that suggest they are looking at bigger locations which I hope is true.  \n\nFood is yummy. Had the ahi taco & for the prize I am in total Ah! Everything is so well put together... Toppings to sauce its an A+ \n\nShakes are decently priced & tasty but in my opinion their juices are a tad over priced. \n\nI also had a latte & that was well crafted too.\n\nKudos to Skinnyfats. Hope you expand soon!
1,"I saw the 7:30 Nocturne show a few weeks ago. While it wasn't as good as Absinthe, it's a funny, entertaining show worth seeing. The small, intimate theater is perfect for the variety acts, making stunts seem more dangerous and impressive. I'm not sure how often they change the acts, but some acts mentioned in other reviews weren't in this show. But, the ones they did have were crowd pleasers -- full of raunchy humor, skill, talent, and feats of strength.\n\nWe didn't have the chance to dine there, but I'd love to come back to experience the food. You'll find the talent from the show performing in the dining rooms before and after they've performed in the theater. In the theater there are two bars with specialty cocktails that'll run about $15 each.\n\nIf you sign up for the Cosmopolitan's email newsletter you may receive codes for discounted tickets. You can also look on LivingSocial for discounts. According to some websites, the show will be closing any day now (possibly relocating to a different hotel/casino) so if you want to see it at the Cosmo, go now."
1,Adobado burrito. Five bucks. Open 24 hours. 'Nuff said!
1,"I just inhaled my first cupcake from this place.  They just earned a new frequent customer.\n\nVery girly store with cupcakes and cocktails, both done expertly.  Creamy frosting prettily piped onto moist, delicious cupcakes.  On fridays and saturdays you can swing by for either until 11pm.  It's right in the center of Champaign downtown, making it perfect for pre-bar, post-dinner, or both on those days."
1,"I was craving Thai food and wanted to try somewhere new. I pass by Pam quite often so I decided to try it out for the first time. When I arrived to the restaurant with some friends and family we were automatically seated. The restaurant had a nice vibe and they kept the restaurant clean and neat. We ordered the Chicken Satay for my daughter to nibble on which she enjoyed very much. We also ordered the Spicy Chicken Basil which is a favorite dish of ours at any Thai Restaurant so we had to order it. The spice level was only 1 just for us to try and see if it was good and it came out delicious. The Panang Curry also came out delicious, just wish they had a bit bigger serving, it seemed like only one person can eat it versus two people sharing. \n\nService was great since we were the only ones there, so the waiter tended to us frequently and made sure our waters/drinks were filled. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because their tables were a little too small for us to put all the entrees that we had ordered. There was only 4 of us and it seemed like we can only fit two/three plates at a time when really we had about 6. I'll be honest I felt like I had to eat my food in 10 seconds just so the other dish will take it's place.\n\nAll in all I've enjoyed the food we tried out and I would recommend them to any of my friends, family and acquaintances!"
1,"Many of you may be wondering about the new Mezzo floor of Sienna Mercato.  The good news is that the service is excellent and the food is delicious.  \n\nThey bring a lot of experience from their other restaurant.  For example, there's a wine I love on the Sienna Sulla menu that also is carried by Mezzo.\n\nI had a wonderful Charcuterie and Cheese Board that was great for splitting for 2 or 3 people.  The Pizza is cooked in an authentic wood fired oven, and the choices are creative.  \n\nFor dessert we split the Gianduja Tartufo, which was a tasty way to finish our meal.  \n\nOne reason the staff was so well trained is they came from one of the other Sienna restaurants.  All in all, highly recommended."
1,"It truly is a heavenly experience to find delicious food in Las Vegas away from the strip.  We found this restaurant on a random website and it is wonderful!!  We brought a bottle of wine to cork, but I my husband was so thrilled with the wine list that we bought one of theirs.  So many different flavors and tastes.  Amazing service with a very knowledgeable staff.   I would go back again and again!  Take a few friends with you so you can order more dishes to share!  \n\nLOVED IT!"
1,"Solid Thai food at a fair price.  Thai House in Univeristy area has better music, decor, and ambience, but costs about 30% more."
0,"While in Vegas for a conference last week, my company treated us to dinner at SW Steakhouse and while the steaks were fantastic, the rest of the meal left us lacking.\n\nThe waiting area is extremely small and there are only about 6 stools in the bar, so large-ish groups like ours (5 at the time, 7 in total), can find themselves standing around for quite a bit.\n\nOnce seated, the service was extremely slow as we sat, ready to order but unattended to for at least fifteen minutes.  The wine that was recommended to us, although okay, was nothing special and, they only had two bottles, meaning we had to switch mid-way thorough the meal.  Every quality steakhouse I've ever been to has always notified us of a low inventory BEFORE serving the wine, especially when we've had a group of 5-7 people.  Not a major issue with SW but it just shows a lack of finesse, especially when paying a minimum of $54 for an a la carte steak.\n\nOn to the food...\n\nAs I mentioned, the steaks are FANTASTIC.  The veal chop that was ordered by a fellow diner also received rave reviews.  I had the smallest steak offered, a 9oz filet, cooked medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Another diner had the same steak only cooked medium well and his only (small issue) was that had specifically requested it be cooked with a thin line of pink and there was no pink at all.  But, he had zero complaints on the flavor or the texture - it was buttery and juicy and he thoroughly enjoyed it.  Rib-eyes were ordered by the rest of the table and all greatly enjoyed their steaks.\n\nAs with most (all?) high-end steakhouses, all sides are ordered a la carte.  At SW, the sides are $12 each with the sauteed wild mushrooms and grilled asparagus being the exception as they are $16 each.  All the sides are large enough to share but the potatoes gratin is quite small and unless everyone takes a very small portion, it would only serve 3.  And although the rest of the sides we ordered - creamed spinach, roasted mushrooms and black truffle creamed corn - were more than enough to serve all 7 of us, I have to wonder if that was due to the poor quality of the sides. No one went back for seconds on anything except the mushrooms. I can say that I highly recommend them,\n\nThe potatoes gratin came out lukewarm with the cheesy crust already solidified.  The potatoes were undercooked and we had to use a knife to remove the servings as the spoon was unable to cut through the hard potatoes.\n\nThe creamed spinach was not creamy. At all. It was all water without any of the normal creamy goodness that you expect to be clinging to the spinach.  It was swimming in water when it came to the table and once spooned on the plate, the water went everywhere, affecting all the servings on the plate.\n\nThe black truffle creamed corn was just weird. The black truffle, of which I am normally a HUGE fan, was just misplaced here.  It was almost like an afterthought and simply added to attempt to validate $12 for a $3 dish.  The corn itself was just mush. There were no kernels of plump, sweet corn and in mid-summer, the height of corn season, that's just sacrilege. \n\nThe grilled asparagus were thick and perfectly grilled and perhaps with a seafood dish they would have been more well received.  Or in hindsight, squeezing some fresh lemon on them would have probably made a world of difference.  Their charred smokey flavor too closely resembled that of the steaks and therefore they didn't have any real oomph of their own.  A drizzle of  Hollandaise would have also given them their own identity. \n\nAll in all, I would not go back here again unless invited (and paid for) by someone else.  Cut by Wolfgang Puck will be my next LV steakhouse adventure.  If invited back to SW again, I would at least make sure that we had a table with a view of the Lake of Dreams show. The little peeks that we were able to catch from the corner of our table were very impressive."
1,Tao is the best place in Vegas ! The flavors are unmatched ! Every single dish we ordered from the hamachi with truffle sauce to the biggest fortune cookie and banana pudding was amazing. Hands down the best place to eat in Vegas
1,"Sometimes you need to go for a full three hours to feel satisfied.\n\nVariation after variation, experimentation upon experimentation. Pushing the boundaries of taste and sensation.\n\nBut sometimes you only have 45 minutes to cut to the chase, knock it out and hit the road.\n\nThat was the case with Nobhill Tavern.\n\nAfter consecutive 3 hour tastings at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (http://www.yelp.com/biz/latelier-de-joel-robuchon-las-vegas-2#hrid:hhI-P-rlC0nh3ePOvUsoNA) and Fleur de Lys (http://www.yelp.com/biz/fleur-de-lys-las-vegas#hrid:ssAizDirPAyAkLFt-cFexg) over the past two nights, I had 45 minutes for a final meal in Vegas. It was either that or stop on the drive home at Baker or Barstow and their fine dining options are limited. And by limited I mean non-existent. There was no way I was ending my Vegas eating adventure with drive-thru.\n\nAnd then Nobhill beckoned. Inviting, warm, familiar. And with the promise of quick and easy satisfaction.\n\nWho was I to say no?\n\nWalking through her doors, I was welcomed by a comfortable and warmly lit space. On the right are semi-private booths, separated by glass and curtains. On the left, a long narrow wooden bar with padded leather stools, rows of bottles and glasses lining backlit bookcases behind it. Explore further and the space opens into a larger dining room at the rear of the restaurant. I chose the private booth for our brief liaison, something I would highly recommend. Decorated in warm shades of brown and tan, leather, suede and wood, Nobhill Tavern feels at once neighborhoody and familiar. Kinda like Cheers for foodies.\n\nThe food here is Michael Mina's take on modern American tavern fare. It serves as a counterpoint to Mina's other Las Vegas restaurants: Michael Mina (the Vegas outpost of his signature San Francisco restaurant), Stripsteak (steak) and Seablue (seafood).\n\nBeing on a tight schedule, I skipped the foreplay of appetizers and cut right to the main course. Braised short ribs with whipped potatoes, a Worchestershire sauce and glazed mirepoix. The short ribs were deliciously tender, moist and flavorful. For a simple dish, one of the best executions of braised short ribs in recent memory. The mashed potatoes were creamy and silky smooth, forming a perfect pillow under the generous square of short rib and soaking up the sauce as it flowed off the meat. The glazed vegetables and greens were good too but I was here for a different kind of satisfaction. And this dish did not disappoint.\n\nMy dining partner ordered the American Kobe burger, \""secret sauce\"" and balsamic onions, with a side of fries. As good as my short ribs were, I have to say this was one of the best Kobe burgers I have ever had. Nothing too fancy in its construction, basically just patty, lightly toasted sesame seed bun, with some caramelized onions, tomato and \""secret sauce\"" (i.e. some form of mayo), it was the quality of the patty that really made the burger. Again, moist, dripping with flavor, and well seasoned. The fries were also excellent. Thin cut and double, maybe triple, fried for crispiness. We actually took the remainder of the fries with us for the road.\n\nI would have stayed for a drink but couldn't linger. Payment was made for services very well rendered and a generous tip for extras.\n\nI hit the road feeling both satiated and excited to come back for a longer session next time I'm in Vegas. In the meantime, I've already made a booking for XIV back in LA.\n\nBut sometimes a quickie is all you need to leave Vegas a winner."
0,"I took my truck to this place few months ago for the first time to get an oil change and to get my a/c fix, prices are very high but at the time I needed my a/c fix, after dropping almost 800 I was happy with the work even that the price was little to high, after few days later my a/c start making a noise but was still working so I didn't think it was a big deal so I let it slide, now that it's  been cold and I try to use my heater I just find out it doesn't work, so today I took my truck to get an oil change and I told the a guy name john about the issue with my heater and that I never had a issue until they took my truck apart few months ago to work on the a/c, I was not looking for a handout I was looking more for a let me check it out and see what's going on, but instead I got , it's no way it was us we didn't touch your heater we just work on your a/c, and I cant keep discussing this with you because I have to answer the phones, I guess I was not that important because I wasn't drooping the same amount of cash that I did last time and it was just an oil change, I guess now I'm not a value customer for sure won't come back or refer anyone here."
1,"Let me start by saying OMG! \nAs I was on my plane to Vegas this weekend. I enjoyed my complimentary DirectTV and of course I am on the FOOD NETWORK.\nBY FATE its  THE BEST THING I EVER ATE LAS VEGAS.\n\nHere is the run down with out all the BS intro.\n\nWHAT TO ORDER:\n\nBEEF CARPACCIO (super yum for starters)\n\nCHILE RUBBED RIB EYE (it feeds 2 if youre hungry) the dish is to DIE FOR the best thing on the entree menu TRUST ME \nMeat was so soft so melt in your mouth delish. My mouth is watering thinking about it. (109$)\n\nAs for the side dishes try the Black truffle creamed corn...and the au gratin is meh so just get the fries or its just nothing since the entree is huge.\n\nMust try the Banana Creme Brule. and the dessert wine Torque or something ask the wine/beverage guy he knows what its called.\n \nOr the Cool ass looking funnel cake thingys with 4 diff sauces to dip.\n\nOh and the bread basket is freaking good too, cheddar bacon bread thing and hot and fresh. \n\n5 star service.  \n\nHAPPY EATING!"
1,"Incredible customer service.  They are very friendly and go out of their way to learn the names of all of their regular customers.\n\nThere is a good patio for sitting, which attracts a large crew of regulars who spend a good part of the morning there.\n\nA line does sometime form around 8-9 am, and I sometimes wonder why they don't do more to make sure during their super rush hours they aren't better staffed.\n\nOverall though, this is my favorite Starbucks."
0,"I don't get the hype. \nI took Hunnie Bunnie here for a treat so we could both try out the new cupcake in town. I wasn't impressed. \nI didn't know there was a cupcake schedule so the cupcakes I actually wanted to order weren't available on Friday. \nWe opted for Red Velvet and the Black and White. No bells and whistles went off for me and at almost $4 a pop I should have experienced SOMETHING!! \nI would like to go back and try the Carrot Cake though and see if that's any better, since that's what I originally wanted to try, but I'm not a fan of their frosting at all. I don't find it soft enough or sweet enough. \nI haven't been to the Cupcakery in YEARS but I can still remember how indulgent and AMAZING their cupcakes were, especially compared to this place!"
0,"I am just now getting around to writing this review almost a year later but the experience I had at this place still sticks out in my mind.  \n\nCame here with a group of girls on a weekday.  We were told it was a big pool party so we got there at 11 am when it opened and waited in line.   We had to wait about 30 minutes while they let in a couple people at a time.  We were expecting it to be super crowded since they were only letting a few in at at a time.  It was super hot (which is fine since it was Las Vegas in June) but the guy at the door kept giving us the run around about why we couldn't just go in.   \n\nWe finally got in and there was absolutely NO ONE in there.   Every bed was completely empty except for two and only a few people were in the lounge chairs and a couple at the bar.    Now we had never been in one of these places so we didn't know we had to pay for a bed.   It was $1000 dollars for the bed which was crazy because there wasn't anyone there.    We did put our stuff down on the bed and were ignored for about 20 minutes until the \""pool director\"" came over and informed us of the price.   My friend negotiated with her and since it was so slow we could have the bed but we would have to buy drinks.  My friend put an order in for 3 $25 dollar drinks and a bucket of 6 waters ($50).   We sat for about 40 more minutes and the drinks never arrived however the ladies that came in after us got their stuff immediately.  \n\nWe were super pissed so we just left but not without letting the waitress know how angry we were.  She played dumb and pretended like she was \""so sorry\"" she forgot.   I don't think they wanted us in there to begin with.  \n\nWe went out of Liquid and over to the regular Aria pool where we had a much better time.  It was very relaxed and the pool was nice."
1,"The hot and sour soup is da bomb!  Seriously the best I've ever had.  It's full of tender shrimp and chopped green onions that give it some great freshness.  The large bowl that serves 4 people is only $5.  It's so good, I could eat the whole thing myself.  We were there with 6 people and all ordered different entrees.  Garlic chicken stir fry, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Lemon Pepper Chicken, General's Chicken (not spicey enough), Kung Pao Chicken (not spicey enough either).  The Garlic chicken stir fry was the best.  If you like spice, ask them to make your entree more spicy, as everything is pretty mild.  There is also a secret menu, so if you have some Chinese favorites that aren't on the menu, ask your server.  The chicken is very high quality and I believe all white meat.  I will go back for the soup and garlic chicken stir fry, and get more recommendations from the servers.  This will definitely be my go-to Chinese restaurant."
0,Used to like this place now it's sucking more and more each time I go this was my last visit when I ordered country crepes and I got hash and eggs even the coke was flat
1,This is my favorite place to go when I'm in the steel city.  The atmosphere is awesome and the staff is very friendly.  The beer sampler and Ruben is a solid choice but they also have a wide range of other options including hasenfefer and Wiener schnitzel.
0,"Blech\nBut for the amazing kindness of the staff my experience would have been a total loss.  Very dated not well prepared not even  properly heated vintage 1998 vegetarian fare. Wish I could have liked it but I couldn't even eat it. Cold, twice reheated stuffed bell peppers with flavourless brown rice and red beans, tough chewy (again flavourless) Brussels sprouts, half decent kale salad (surprisingly bright dressing-the only highlight of the experience). Yuck.  This is my second visit after a terrible first. My bad for returning-shame on me."
0,"Great place if you want to see and be seen... \n\nI brought my husband to N9NE for his birthday because it was highly recommended -- but we were super disappointed.\n\nFood: Average, nothing too memorable\nService: Not very polite or attentive\n\nThey should realize that pretentious bullying and inattentive service is sooo 80s!\n\nRecommend the bar only."
1,"This place is a classic.  Good food for a decent price.  Staff is awesome.  You can't go wrong with this place.  The charcoal broiled shimp are amazing.  If you go, ask for Linda for your server.  She rocks."
1,"For the first time ever, I kinda wish I lived in Las Vegas.\n\nI had the miyagi san burger yesterday... and I can not stop thinking about it!?!\n\nWe went at 3pm, and it just happened to be the start of their 3-6pm happy hour.\n\nNothing on the happy hour menu really caught our eye.  We were planning on trying the oxtail chili cheese fries as our appetizer.  The normal order is $11.50.  They have a half order size for $6 on the happy hour menu.  Lol... is that really a deal??  whatevs... we were gonna order it anyway.  The half order is a really good size.  And it was pretty tasty.  Not addicting as some claim... But a worthy appetizer.  The cilantro was a nice touch.  I wish they added more.\n\nFor our meal, he ordered the Kiki, I got the Miyagi-San, we shared the salted french fries and a salted caramel marshmallow milk shake.\n\nNeither of us loved the Kiki.  It was way too sweet.  Sadly, he even left a few bites.  And, if you know my guy... he NEVER leaves a bite of anything.\n\nThe fries were fries.  They must really love sweet stuff here because they have a pineapple ketchup.\n\nThe salted caramel marshmallow milk shake is not all it's hyped up to be.  It tasted like a muted chocolate shake to me.  No real hint of salt in it... and it had some crushed graham crackers on top (I think?) and some extra whipped marshmallow.  Also, it's a REALLY small serving.  For a $6 milkshake, I expect it to be a decent portion.\n\nTheir saving grace was the Mr. Miyagi-San!!  ** I'm in love **\n\nI will gladly drive the 30 minutes off the strip and wait 15-20 minutes for a table (even though there were plenty of empty tables when we arrived), just so I can have that delectable burger again.\n\nI will never be able to eat another burger after having had the Miyagi San :'(\n\nWhat makes it so delicious, you ask???  I don't know.  But, I ordered it medium with all the toppings just the way they offer it and it was utter perfection.  The problem with the Kiki was that it was too sweet.\n\nThe Miyagi tempers the sweetness of the meat just perfectly with the onion rings and egg and the furikake stuff... the slight crunch of the onion rings...  mmm... I'm drooling now just remembering the whole experience.\n\nI was nice.  I shared my burger w my bf.  He was a bit jelly that my burger was SOOO much better than his.\n\nWe will definitely be back.  \n\nBachi Burger was our last stop of a 3 day food frenzy in Vegas.  And, it was the best stop of the trip!\n\nBetter than anything we ate at the much over-hyped Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars... I'm just sayin'..."
1,I had a great time last year and look forward to this year's event!
0,"I just want to let everyone know that they don't wash their strawberries before they dip them in the chocolate, and sometimes the strawberries are moldy. Also they claim to be so healthy but all their sauces are mayo based. That is why they don't have nutrition facts available. They don't want you to know how UN Healthy it is."
1,"This place is dramatically better inside since they fixed it up. The once dinky bar counter is now a full on bar with plenty of seating and selection. Various types or art adorns the wall, though it's a little dark to fully appreciate some of it. The lighting is appropriate for everything else though.\n\nThey didn't really change the stage area. There is still a giant stage with tons of space in front of it and plenty of dancing and sitting room. There is one new thing in the stage room. You can access a section of the bar now, which is awesome.\n\nThe is one let down. I'm not sure if they are fixing it up or it's just been closed but you can no longer get up on the balcony, which used to be one of my favorite places to relax. Hopefully they have it open again. But all and all, I love what they did with the place."
0,OMG!!!! I am a New Yorker and I am so disappointed!  The only only thing that reminded me of the original deli are the pictures hanging up. I dont mind paying $10.50 for a Reuben but pile it on like the New York location does.. I took my father there also a native New Yorker because we remember how it was and such a let down. We both said Arby's has them beat!!
1,"Best Dive Bar in Phoenix!  That's all I have to say!\n\nBut since everyone knows I always have much much much more to say....\nThis bar has the best juke box, the bouncer on the weekends is the former commercial stunt double for Charles Barkley, they make me free(!)  Shirley Temples when I'm the DD or just not in the mood to drink.\n\nMy night never ends with this bar, we always seem to meet new people and end up at some random house party afterwards.  I always know people in the bar too, which is nice!  So if I don't know where anyone is, I'll just head to the Bikini Lounge and find someone to hang out with!\n\nOne night these two guys who just got out of jail were there, it was a slow weeknight and we befriended them.  They told us stories for hours.  I never wanted to go jail before, but after their stories I definitely never ever want to go to jail."
0,First off my husband and I wanted to go dancing somewhere FUN in Vegas.  We decide to call the front desk and check to see where would be the place for us.  She said THE BANK!  Ok?  So we get there and the place has NO real line.  Everyone is looking around wondering if they are in line or what.   WHICH IS SUPER  SUPER ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!  NOT COOL!  Then when we get to the FRONT of this no line....line the super cocky guy at the front looks at us like?  WHAT?  He asks us how many in our party.  Before this I see him sending people away if they are groups of guys......=( WHATEVER?  He tells them he is letting in one guy one girl and they just need to get lost.  OK?  So I am thinking my hubby and I are good.  He lets us in after a long wait.  WHATEVER?  I think he thinks his shit don't stink or something?  The dancing was fun but not 30 bucks a person fun.  I felt bad for dragging my husband out who doesn't really love to dance and paying $60 bucks just to get in..........=(  This club isn't worth it at all.  They make you feel like you have to be a group of girls to come in and if you are a group of guys on a Friday or Saturday night you have to pay for a SUPER expensive table or you're not getting in.  GROUP OF GUYS: DO NOT COME HERE  GROUP OF GIRLS:  YOU'RE GOOD COUPLES: NOT A GOOD IDEA
0,"Had a good time bowling with the family last night until we were harassed by Garland who apparently is a security guard there. I've lived in Vegas for 15 years and have never been treated so poorly. BC of Garland, I will never visit this or any wildfire again. Don't waste your time or money there."
0,"I honestly have been waiting to write this review for a long time and I make sure to tell anyone I know NOT to go to this club. And it's not because the drinks are expensive or something small like that. It's because I honestly had one of the worst experiences with a club EVER there and it nearly drove me to tears. Here's why:\n\nSo a group of friends and I met in Vegas to celebrate my best friend's 21st birthday. Before we got to Vegas I bought three tickets to Hakkasan which cost me close to $200. Then once we were in Vegas, I found a promoter to get the rest of the group in for free. But here's the catch: the promoter said we had to be there by 10:00 pm to get in for free, so that's what we did. Once we got inside we found out that unless you're ordering bottle service or a VIP, there isn't a single place to sit and just drink. And we found out Calvin Harris wasn't coming on till 1 am. So we asked SEVERAL of the people working inside that if we left, could we get back inside? They said there would be a re-entry line but that we would get back in eventually.\n\nWhen my friends and I returned a few hours later, the people REFUSED to let us back in claiming they \""don't do that at Hakkasan.\"" After I told them that several people inside had told me it was okay and showed them the very expensive tickets I purchased, they said it was irrelevant and that we should move along. What made me even more pissed off was that as soon as we walked away, I saw the same bouncers let a group of girls back in that had left earlier.\n\nI have NEVER received such poor customer service from an establishment and hope to never step foot near Hakkasan again. So I guess my advice is, if you're ready to spend hundreds of dollars on a table and bottle service, I'm sure this club is decent. But if you're an average person, stay far, far away!"
0,"The decor is the best aspect.\n\nTERRIBLE service. The waiter could not show us on the wine list where anything was.  He did the fly by \""is everything ok\"" without stopping. One glass of wine i ordered was corked--but nothing from the waiter.\n\nWe ordered first soup, then appetizer, then our meal.\n\nThey rushed out the soup and appetizer together (this on a not busy night). We asked them to slow it down but apparently they don't know how. it felt like Applebees' services with higher priced food.\n\n\nThe food is not tapas--there is a very small appetizer menu. Of that the octopus was delicious, as was the onion soup.  the entrees were not at all memorable. We did not bother with dessert.\n\nEven had we decent service we felt like this is a restaurant trading on the chef's name with no hint of the august heritage. a misuse of a brand name chef--or an over extension of a name with one restaurant that does not meet the standards. This restaurant could not survive without the Hubert Keller name."
0,"This locksmith store seems to know what they are doing and the only locksmith store that is capable of duplicating my key. However, I was left standing there in the store without a word on for close to 10 minutes after requesting a key to be duplicated... \n\nWhen I said \""Excuse me, I don't mean to rush you, but could you tell me how long the process will take?\"" I was given back the key by the owner and told that he would not be rushed. I responded \""I did not mean mean to be rude or anything\"" he just walked away with his back turned against me. \n\nThe other employee apologized and told me to come back another time.\n\nIn all honesty, how can you be the owner of a business and treat customers with so little respect and courtesy. I am not a fan."
1,"Whoaaa, before I dive into my review, do the women that work here have to meet a certain \""good looking\"" quality?  I don't think I saw one woman here that was not good looking and they were efficient with our order...Welp onto the boring stuff ha.\n\nI really enjoyed the environment, it had different types of people enjoying there tasty breakfast.  We arrived before the rush and I was well pleased with our food.   I ordered the BC Signature French Toast, the fresh \nstrawberries and almonds were a nice touch.  DEF COMING FOR MORE Ha."
1,"I simply cannot imagine the reviewers that give Joel Robuchon's restaurant in Vegas anything but five stars have any real experience with fine dining. I have eaten a wide range of Michelin starred restaurants and NOTHING compares to Joel Robuchon's brilliant cuisine. Days later, my better half and I were still discussing the foie gras appetizer and the veal cheek main course. And the bread cart... oh, the bread cart.... really, you just have to see it to believe it. It will change your life, seriously.\n\nThe service was also impeccable--timely, yet never intrusive, and the sommelier went out of her way to provide us with a pile of information. \n\nOverall, this dinning experience was nothing short of masterful."
1,"Very authentic Hong Kong-style \""street cart noodles\""!\nBeware cash only!\n\nI haven't had noodles and pork skin this good since I lived in Hong Kong. The blood cube is the best I've had on the West Coast (and real pork blood too not chicken, even if it's not as good as Hong Kong's). They even have Ho Fun (flat rice noodles). The seating is simple but clean. Good for a casual food stop. I'll have to try their curry fish balls next time! My blunder was that I forgot to bring cash (only cash accepted), but the staffs were nice enough to let me came back later without giving me any hassle."
0,"Terrible experience just now, had to share. To be fair, the seating/accoustics/performers are always fine. The experience is always hampered (upon arrival and departure) by the parking situation!\n\nWe had such a poor experience - and the biggest complaint is how poorly they accommodate fans who wish to have a fun family tailgating experience. Essentially, your options for this are very limited!\n\nThis was such an abuse of power and such idiocy. They greeted us with... Intimidation and anger! (Bizarre to say the least) On this day, parking opened ONE HOUR BEFORE THE EVENT??? A few hours ago the \""day of website\"" said 3pm so we planned accordingly... Ready to tailgate before the Oddball (Comedy) Festival, we checked it again at noon, still said 3pm. There should be a way to subscribe for updates... \n\nWe planned and checked the \""day of\"" link, arrive only to find it had again been updated and get aggressive personnel tell us to turn around, and leave right away. What? Event is at 5, now parking doesn't open till 4pm? The officer, frankly, was a jerk too! (Ok, the time changed, but handle it better!!!)\n\nWe had just pulled in, we're asking the parking lot attendant when it changed and up comes a macho police officer (so he thought he was), stomping up to our car to interject. What was odd, is he came out of nowhere, we had been there for about 35 seconds, seated and buckled talking through our window, and up comes this officer with Napoleon Complex - or some issue...  He quickly waddles up - like he's chaeffed or something - and before my husband (driver) can turn his head to look at him he yells, \""TURN AROUND!\"" Then walks up to his window and yells it again. Annoyed, but knowing not to do anything stupid, my husband says \""Yes, sir\"" and still, this officer is yelling, turn around. I have to imagine he had JUST come off of a case or some issue - nothing could explain his approach, aggressiveness and anger. Becuase you never know how crazy people are or when they will chose to abuse their power, we did as asked and left - and then SAT IN A PARKING LOT A MILE AWAY FOR AN HOUR! Stupid! If we had the time, I would have gotten this guy's name and badge number to file a formal complaint. Since I didn't/couldn't, I'm venting here. \n\nTIP FOR \""SECURITY\"": How about, I don't know, you speak in a normal tone and explain the schedule changed. It was interesting watching the the attendant's emotions go from angry and annoyed, while sitting, to STANDING (remind you, we're seated in our car), with a red face and teetering angrily like he's going to fight or have an accident in his pants...? This is so bizarre, and frankly pitiful. Especially since we paid a lot of money for VIP parking and box seats. \n\nReconsider the next time you attend an event here, my husband swears he won't return.  PNC/LiveNation, revisit your parking policy, your hours, your communication of last minute changes, and add some bathrooms throughout the parking lot. \n\nHad to share our experience. From reading other reviews, their whole parking situation, unprofessional parking staff's and police's manner of handling parking, the admission process and exit procedures have cost them some well earned negative reviews and a poor reputation. \n\nAlso, I've noticed they don't adhere to the \""no tall camping chairs\"" in the lawn rule. So if you go, be prepared to be treat poorly, wait forever to park, if you're in the lawn just know you cannot see over the tall chairs, and know it takes a good 1+ hour to exit while nearly getting hit by aggressive drivers trying to cut in front of you (or drunkenly into the side of you)... oh, and don't bother paying extra for VIP parking (there's nothing VIP about it). VIP seats are fine, but don't pay for the parking \""upgrade.\"" Tsk tsk PNC!\n\nThe learnings for PNC/LiveNation: Provide updates on changing parking lot times, allow MORE time so families CAN tailgate (you're not using the lot anyway, let guests in and get settled), provide restrooms/porta-potties in the lots, make parking & LEAVING much safer and more efficient. Lastly, teach your staff and the hired help some manners. As for the performers - they always provide a great experience! As I hope would be expected, this is a review on the services and the venue itself only. Don't bother doing lawn seats unless you don't mind having some big guy in a large camping chair sitting in front of you either... if you can, pay extra for seats."
1,"I first came here on a referral from my PCP for some questionable skin spots.  I became a regular because of the esthetician.  I wanted to give up going to salons for skin treatments because I had heard of a few horror stories so I was in search of a med spa, luckily Arizona Dermatology has an esthetician on staff.  This location is convenient for me, the pricing is reasonable, the staff is friendly and the office is clean.  No complaints = 5 stars!"
0,"I ordered chicken fingers, bacon cheese fries & a oreo cookie shake. The delivery took 1 hr & 45 minutes. The food was cold & the fingers were over cooked. The shake was described as a custard ice cream shake but it tasted like crushed ice-milk with that consistency too. If thats a  custard milkshake, which I have eaten, then im a blonde lol...\nOn the plus side was that they put a lot of bacon on the bacon cheese fries. But, thats about it. Needless to say, im never ordering from this place again."
1,"Spring roll factory is the first fast casual Vietnamese Restaurant I've been to in Arizona. The concept reminds me of Chipotle. Their menu is very small and a lot of the same ingredients can be made in different ways depending on your preference: spring roll, rice bowl, sandwich, or noodle bowl. The concept is nice especially if you're in the mood for something fresh, quick and easy without being overwhelmed with too many choices. The food is also very good. I've had the pork sandwich, the fish spring rolls and the mussels. Everything is made to order. All of the dishes I've tried so far have been great, but my favorite item on the menu has to be the Iced Coffee. In my opinion, it's just as good, if not better than Lee's iced coffee. As if the food and coffee weren't enough, the owners of this restaurant are so kind and welcoming. You won't regret giving them your business."
1,"The food was outstanding, the service was good, the price was high. I was in no way disappointed by the quality, presentation or ANYTHING about India Oven, but the price for entrees here is shocking, particularly when rice or breads are not included in it.  Treat yourself to the food here, just cope ahead of time with the $30 per person price for lunch. \n\nThe decor is nice generic white tablecloth, the building unremarkable and the location not upscale, so these can't be the cost basis.  Maybe the buffet is cheaper, but I ordered from the menu so I could get the amazing onion bagee and a standard, but non-buffet entree, which was $17.  FYI, the little strip mall it's in is a pit--without having reached graffiti and boarded-up window status--but the food was stunning!  If you like/eat Indian food as much as I do, you'll want to visit India Oven.  If it weren't for the entree prices, I'd have given it 5 stars."
0,"i love coupons. apparently the server at cantina laredo doesn't. i presented mine (free guacamole!) and she looked horrified but returned a few minutes later with all the proper ingredients. it was fun to watch the guacamole mashed together right in front of our eyes. we dined with some out of town guests who found the guacamole presentation exciting ... i fear that until friday night they had never been introduced to it. \n\nour out-of-towners are not familiar with the mexican food the way most phoenicians are and asked *lots* of questions that were met with nothing short of annoyance from our server. then my dad demanded the server re-explain an entree for my mother, who \""might\"" want to order it (she didn't). yes, our table was probably a pretty annoying one to be stuck with, but that's part of being a server. suck it up. i'm sure you dealt with people far more awful than our group before.\n\nour food arrived within a reasonable length of time. the server and her helper had a hard time figuring out whose food belonged to whom - fine at applebee's, but i expected that this place would match the entree to the diner with ease. the food, admittedly, looked great. i had the fiesta chicken salad, complete with not ripe avocado and delivered with the wrong dressing. i ate it anyway. chicken was way too salty. hub had the carne asada steak. it was served charred but tasty, and portion was really small. we just didn't understand how that cheap cut of meat could fetch $18.99. i can't speak to what the other 5 in our group had; i was focused on choking down my salty chicken. \n\nafter our food was delivered, our server failed to appear again until she asked if we would like dessert. i could have used another vodka tonic 20 minutes earlier and a water refill. dessert, a chocolate nut brownie thing with ice cream, was created table side and everyone agreed it was the best part of the meal. my bottom line: the food we ate was overpriced. our food was just ok. service sucked. there's no reason to go back."
0,"I called \""discount\"" sprinklers and was charged $470 to fix my lawn valve and 4-5 leaks in my drip. To my dismay, one month later my drip system would not shut off. Come to find my other valve from the drip went bad (which they checked when they initially came a month ago). Instead of working with me, he charged an astronomical amount of an additional $245 on top of what I had already paid the month prior. When I said I couldn't pay for that, he seemed fine with it and went on his merry way. \n\nI will not be using these service again. I feel like I was taken advantage of because I am a female and do not know anything about sprinklers or drip!"
0,"After hearing so many good things about the Wynn I expected more from the food at this restaurant, and the service really sucked. They sat us right in front of the place in the restaurant and pretty much forgot about us. I had to turn around and flag the waiters down twice for refills and then again for the check. This was strange as the place was pretty dead."
0,On trac is the worst delivery company I have ever had the displeasure of working with.  Ontrac does not mean on time.  Takes twice as long to get things up from california that any other company. No Not USE these clowns.
1,"I live around the corner from SGC, but will drive right by it to get to this great shop. Why? Customer service and taking the time to care about ALL customers. The manager says hello to everyone who walks in the door (male or female are treated equally--NICE!) and someone always takes the time to explain the purchase and never up-sell. \n\nSmall and friendly is how to run a business! Avoid the flashy over-priced places and go to Bear Arms, you won't regret it."
1,"My first stop in Phoenix was the Fry Bread House and I instantly started a fry bread addiction for the rest of my stay. The surroundings are nothing fancy and the food comes out in disposable containers, but its delicious and extremely cheap. I particularly recommend the green chile stew that comes with a side of fry bread."
0,Service: please take a moment to understand you customer to in turn serve them well... I will always take care of you but tonight (tues evening) everyone seemed too busy to educate understand and bring me apprised as a first time guest at the string bean... Although... Second chance is scheduled... Wine dear! Hoping for the best! Giving ya a solid... I will always buy wine here in Belmont!
0,Came here with a group of friends on a Friday night.\nWe sat down for what seemed like forever before a\nsingle waiter/waitress acknowledged our existence.\nYeah - so we looked like a sorry bunch of recently\nreleased inmates all liquored up and nowhere to go\nbut still! So finally this waiter tries to take our\ndrink orders. We ordered a round and asked for menus.\nWe were then told that they stop serving actual food\naround 10pm even though the place will serve alcohol\ntill 2am. Really? You have a crapload of people all\ndrinking and getting loaded for the next four hours\nbut you don't want to serve food anymore because \nyou'd rather give that business to one of your many\ncompetitors nearby? What kind of North Korean rocket\nscientist running this place came up with that idea?\nIt's ok though because a competitor DID make quite a\nfew $$$ off us that night on both drinks AND food. \nAnd next time we'll know not to bother wasting our \ntime here.
1,"They really do a great job, and you will really pay for it. I don't have incredibly pricey clothing, so getting my $50 blouses dry cleaned here just doesn't make sense- but I would absolutely trust them with very important articles (nice sport coats, lined trousers, wedding gowns, blood soaked mattresses... haha, kidding)."
0,"My husband and I dropped by on the way home from Vegas. It seems they advertise their drinks but we didn't try any. Since it's called Fat Dumpling, I expected good food. The XLB had the right flavor but not very juicy. The shrimp dumplings had barely any shrimp in it, mostly greens.  The green onion pancake was dry and tasted like flour.  The seaweed salad and bean curd salad were bland."
0,"I sat down at a sushi bar in front of Beaudevin after a half hour of aimlessly wandering the airport for a meal under $8. The first Burger King I approached with hesitation. People are seeing me here- I better leave right now. I walked back to the main terminal, taking the stairs. I then came across Burger King #2. Knowing nothing would be cheaper besides a bag of chips, I bought a 3 piece buffalo chicken strip box. I kept my sunglasses on and sat at a table facing the wall. Regret sunk in as I pushed away empty ketchup packets to make space for my steaming pile of shit. A strong vinegar aroma escaped as I opened the box. The food didn't look like the picture. Foiled again.\n\nI took a bite and by the force of Christ's trust fund, I stood up and chucked it in the nearest waste bin. \""F*CK THIS, I'M GETTING SASHIMI!\"" I exclaimed to no one in particular.\n\nI'm trying this new thing where I don't spend all my money on eating out. It's obviously going along well.\n\nI sat at the airport sushi bar and asked about the chef's (hahaha) usual selection for the six pieces of sashimi I planned on getting. Then, from the corner of my eye I spotted pilots eating immaculate mediterranean salads - topped with salmon- off gorgeous square glass plates. I got up before the waitress could drop my glass of water. I headed into Beaudevin where everyone was wearing business attire and I looked like I do protests for free Tibet or whatever. The menu looked delectable. This was the refreshing re-start I needed. I was sat in the corner where the waitress asked for my drink. I asked for a water with cucumber. I knew there were cucumbers behind the bar because they had Hendrick's gin on the shelf. Over five minutes passed in an empty restaurant. At the 7-8 minute mark I saw her re-emerge behind the bar. This time grabbing a glass, I was sure it was for me and then I relaxed again. Two more minutes passed and she still had not shown with the glass of water. Perhaps it is karma for abandoning my would be glass of water at the sushi joint, but how does it really take 10+ minutes in a virtually empty establishment to pour a glass of water? (I'm very aware that I'd be hard pressed to find better food in the airport.) At that point my flight would be boarding in 20 minutes so I left and bought a chocolate bar instead. I ate half of it and then fell asleep with it in my coat pocket where it melted, only to be rediscovered days later at the airport again."
0,Never coming back here again! Got charged 167 dollars for a meal that was 16 dollars. Had to call the bank since my account got overdrawn and didn't even get an apology. I used to come here all the time but they definitely lost my business for good.
1,"I have been taking the scenic route home a lot recently, hitting up Best Buy and some of the other retailers in the vicinity before making a final pit stop to Bahama Buck's.  During weekday lunch period, the parking spaces closest to Bahama Buck's are very hard to find unoccupied.  But if you are worried about long lines and the associated wait time for getting your shaved ice on, do not worry your pretty/handsome faces.  The occupants of those vehicles all appear to be at the sandwich or the other fast casual dining operations adjacent to this destination.\n\nEven if you have to wait briefly to place an order or for the order to be made fresh, there are two Bahama Buck's TV playing GoPro and Monsters footage of people doing amazing adventurous stuff that most of us may never get around to attempting in our existence here.  My eyes are usually so glued to the TVs that my order of the umbrella topped shaved ice, soaked of food coloring packed flavor syrups, is ready for the hand off before I think I should get impatient.\n\nTheir shaved ice is pretty fine, not like \""snowflake\"" powdery fine, but definitely not the chunky small crushed ice I have had at the state fair in my teen years.\n\nI like tart/sour flavors, so that segment of their menu is the only category of flavors I have personal encounters with.  Is it really all that tart? Not in my opinion, but it is still a refreshing treat when the temperature goes back up.  I do however warn against getting the Blue Raspberry flavor, the taste is fine, but what comes out at the end has an interesting and shocking color effect.\n\nBesides shaved ice, they have smoothies and even coffee drinks.  I have seen others order the smoothies,but I have not been there frequently enough to be present when coffee based items are ordered.\n\nIf you plan to frequent this business, be sure to get a stamped (punch) card.  When the weather is really cold, you could earn 2x, 3x and even 4x  \""polar punches\"" starting when the temperature dips under 50, 40 and 30 degrees, respectively.  \n\nBonus:  Color changing spoons are amusing for the kids. Come here enough times and you can build up your own collection of miniature umbrellas for your next paradise themed cocktail party staycation.  Until then enjoy the nice weather we are currently having.\n\nReview #11 of 2014"
0,"Service sucks.  The hostess (surly, middle-aged blond) was unbelievably rude.  I don't know if she was having a bad day, but she did not need to take it out on customers.  No tacos are worth that attitude.  Good riddance.\n\n(PS on Apr 3)- I see other reviews suggesting the surly middle-aged blond may have been the owner.  That is so much worse than a nasty hostess.  If I could give this place a 0 stars, I would.  :("
0,Was enjoying dinner and a beer @the bar when a guy walks in with a 2yr kid in his arms & sits @bar next to me! Then guy puts kid up on the bar!

0,"No! No! No! No!\n(I could just end my review there.)\n\nA friend was craving good New Mexican green chile and asked me for suggestions.\nHe scoffed at the first couple - then I mentioned I heard good things about La Ristra.\n(I have noted those people and will never take food advice from them again!)\nGilbert is not a close trek for either of us - but in the search for solid New Mexican food, I am more than willing to travel. He also expressed concern about being Brown in Gilbert. I assured him I'd protect him (and my car is white enough to cover both of us!), and finally sold him using the picture of the banana burrito dessert on the menu.\n\nWe shared a cheese crisp that was just like any other cheese crisp, but the chips and salsa were good. The chips were really good. I thought we were off to a great start!\n\nI ordered the beef, Christmas style, with egg. (Christmas style is half green chile, half red.) A fried egg on top is common in New Mexico, sides of rice and black beans. My friend had the blue corn enchilada, also Christmas style, with egg; sides of rice and pinto beans.\n\nThe first sad sign was when the plates arrived. Each was served with what they call a sopapilla. Well, it's in line with most sopapillas you'd get in AZ - but it is NOTHING like the ones in New Mexico. (If you've had one, you'd understand.)\nNeither of us thought our food was bad, per se, but it was REALLY bland. Really, REALLY bland! My friend suggested maybe we went through a wormhole to a retirement home in Albuquerque circa 1983, it was so bland!\nWell over half our meals were boxed up. At least we could take refuge in the banana burrito. Well, no. They were out of it.\nAll in all, it was such a disappointing dinner we were laughing about how we'll look back on it as a bonding experience.\n\nI barely made it home before my dinner wanted to evacuate my body in a violent way - but I am hit and miss with dairy, so I figured it was the cheese, not the rest of the food. Until he sent me a text the next day that dinner pretty much wrecked him. The end. I see no need to go back under any circumstances."
0,"Wow. You could dominate with a place like this. Instead it just sucks. Too long to make drinks, bad food. Mediocre service. The best I can say is it's coffee when you need it."
0,"Food was not good. Wife said the chicken tacos tasted horrible. Cheese enchilada tasted like dirt. The bean burrito was ok but I had them add sour cream and guacamole.  The prices were way too high for this low quality of food. I should have known better than to eat here when i saw they don't accept credit cards.  When an owner is too cheap to pay visa/MasterCard 2% of a transaction, you know they are going to be cheap with the food quality too."
0,"So. Not. Worth. It.\n\nReally, save your money and have someone fire up the grill. \nK/W needs to nut up on their restaus. They are SEEEERIOSLY lacking."
1,"I actually had my wedding dinner here after our ceremony. It was an unusual choice but i wanted something casual and near our hotel. This seems liked the place. They had a catering menu we ordered off, it wasn't cheap, but they provided enough food for everyone and everything for the most part was decent. I would say it was a couple steps up from bar food. The best thing was they made our wedding cake, which was $75, cute, feed all 20 of us and was delicious!!!! (red velvet with cream cheese frosting)\nI probably wouldnt come here again next time were in Vegas just due to all the different places to try, but if you want an upscale bar with food, you should check them out."
1,Talk about class and Beautful people\nSurrounding Fix was a great time tonight and the Food was amazing are server was beautiful and very Atendent great costumer service. Try the lobster tacos and wings my favorite I'll be back soon!
1,I go to this location every other week for Happy Hour with one of my BFFs. We love it because they know us the moment we walk in and the server puts in our drink and food order the moment she sees us (she knows it by heart!) \n\nWe also get out of there for under $10 each! It's our go to place for sure. I'm super picky about Mexican food if I want an actual meal but for Happy Hour appetizers and drinks you can't beat the price!
1,"I love the Beatles and I loved Love! (...and all you really need is love...)\n\nI wanted to see Love for awhile. So, when my husband wanted to go to Vegas for a couple of days, I bought tickets. We were in the second section, which seemed perfect. But, as others have said, there probably isn't a bad seat in the house.\n\n I was completely mesmerized by this show. I think its one of the better Cirque shows I've seen, and the star of the show is definitely the music. Its a dizzying combination of effects, acrobatics, costumes, choreography and music.  \n\nI can't wait to go back and see it again!"
1,"Love this place, the old antiques, the history in the items on display, like part of the Berlin wall in the men's room. I love the bar just outside the buffet with he old time feeling of marble, brass and the fan blades on the rotatory ceiling fans. \n\nI used to enjoy the Wheel of fortune machines just inside the entrance by the Valet, but they updated them and are now more modern. They still have the old kind, but only three of them and of course they are always full! Just like \""The Cal\"" this place is a regular for Hawaiian family and friends, so we come here often. And enjoy it when we do!"
0,"First off....the food was very decent. The lunch specials are cheap and the ones we picked were tasty.\n\nBut OMG!! EEEEEEEWWWW! They had some video on of various \""food\"" items that looked like worms and male body parts squirting uh, liquid, as they were being prepared as food. I swear it was one of the most disgusting videos I've ever seen. Stomach turning, and it makes you wonder what you're eating.\n\nThe video apparently came from their media server, which seemed to only have that video on it.\n\nI can't fathom why they'd play it unless it's to keep non-chinese out (or make us throw up.)\n\nI think I will take a pass and go to China Mama next time.\n\nFreakin' EEW!"

0,"I think place is more like a korean bar. I always look forward to the ban-chan but they didn't serve any. The bul-gogi was super sweet--too sweet and salty too. I was not impressed. Sadly, another Korean miss. There aren't any great korean restaurants in Las Vegas. :("
0,Hmmm....where to start...the concept is great and the location is good but... and there are some BIG buts.....the parking is horrendous. ...second complaint is that happy hour ends at four (4)....what the @!#$. The wine list is not that impressive and cost 22.00 with tip for two glasses. I think that it might be the perfect place on a saturday or sunday where glasses of wine are $5.00 till four (4)...on the other hand Aiellos is RIGHT next door and has 1/2 priced appetizers and drinks till 6 pm and the food and service was wonderful but that's another review......

1,"I like Mckoys..........WAY better than Mac's!!\n\nThe wings are great nice smoked flavor on them and a good variety of sauces to choose from, not just your basic buffalo.\n\nRibs were Enormous!!! I had a 1/2 rack and they too had a great smoked flavor. I had a salad which was surprisingly good and the Mac N Cheese as the waitress put it \""Crack N Cheese\""...wasn't as good as the first time i had it, but still good!! \n\nServer was ok, not looking for a 5 star dining experience but still like it as another option for barbecue!!"
1,"First time here, really wanted brunch but didn't realize they only have it on Sundays. Had their local grass fed burger and it was delicious. Full bar with a great draft list and located in a really quaint house style setting."
0,Drove from queen creek to meet out of town friends here. This place was recommended to them by a local hotel.  After a 35 minute drive we waited 40 minutes for 6 wings to come out. After another 10 minutes we got another 6 wings.  After another 15 minutes we waited and finally got one of our 2 pizzas. Our order was finally complete to our table after an hour . The wings were just ok. We liked that they offered different flavors.  The pizza was horrible. It tasted like a soggy tontinos pizza. Good priced. Great service. The people were very respectful and friendly.
1,I went to this place last week. Was a lil scared cause I don't like going to new places for my eyebrows an I have never had threading done before. I absolutely loved it! Marci did such a great job an it was so quick! Def going back.
1,"Family dinner (we have a lot of those) with kids and they were as happy as we were here.  The crudite' appetizer was delicious and I'm pretty sure we all got about 2 days worth of our veggies here.  We did need a second fill of the tzatsiki sauce though.  The kale salad was great too.  But the star of this meal was my daughter's squash, walnut, and arugula pizza.  I am grateful that she shared a slice with me but next time I will get one of my own!"
1,"Fabulous service. We tried several different raised donuts, they tasted like they just came out of the oven. Great flavor, but just a tad bit greasy. Turkey sandwich on a fresh croissant was good."
1,This was our first time at Chelsea's Kitchen. We sat outdoors on the patio for an early lunch under the shady trees. The servers were friendly and the food was everything people have said it would be. The short rib tacos are seriously delicious. And the kale salad is an experience in gourmet wonderment. We also had the swordfish tacos--delightful. We will most certainly be back.
0,This is the only place to get Schlotzsky's so regardless of the lackluster dining experience  - I will be back.\n\nI love the original.  The warm sourdough type bread with the warm ham... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm good. \n\nThis place is old and run down.  The service sucks.  But if you want some Schlotzcky's this is it!
1,"The sports bar that takes a ski lodge, whips up some solid bar fare, and peppers the place with more 'friendly' waitstaff than you can handle. Order an ice cold beer and you'll likely find bits and pieces of ice floating around that might make you think they tapped a glacier. If that glacier was a brewery. Get the Hangover burger, man-style. Two patties, a fried egg and load of french fries. I like to meet up here with my friends to watch the game and don't worry, the ladies won't make fun of your fantasy football talk!"
0,"Umm like Yelp says up there ^ methinks not! Came down for the Downtown Wednesday Block Happy Hour. They were busy, about 2-3 people deep. We were the 2nd so we got a seat at the bar pretty much as soon as we walked in and conveniently  near the Happy Hour specials sign. However, he failed to serve us in an appropriate time frame. Since he was busy ignoring us we figured we'd ask about the specials and decide what we wanted while we waited for him. We asked the bartender what beers were on special he said they all were. We asked twice, even. They, as well as some of the other bars had a special that included a beer and a shot for $6.00(I believe it was $6.00) Well neither of us are shot people so we just ordered the beer, he said $18.00. I said oh we only get the special if we order a shot? He took a beer away and gave us a bottle of beer and said $20! WTF!! Umm that still doesn't solve the problem. I spoke up and said you said all the beers were on special. He mumbled something but basically used the excuse that they were busy as to why he screwed up our service. I should have told him to shove it and go somewhere else but I didn't, I took the beer and the crappy shot and went on our way. Doubtful that I'll be returning. Poor service, as a bartender you have the power!! Give me the beers you screwed up at the special price listed, you get a bigger tip. You screwed it up after all. The worst part is that he could have cared two craps less that he didn't pay attention, didn't listen and that he screwed it up. Blah!"
1,"Mmmm Organic food ... wait what!?  Yeah I can't say I know the difference in taste.  I guess my palate is not as popping as I say it is -- or maybe there's real no difference!  I can appreciate the idea.  However, the organic part just sounds better and sophisticated.  I eat organic only a-har a-har a-har.  Picazzo's Organic Kitchen is a great selling tool.  Though I can't bash their pizza, it's actually pretty good.  I love their crust is that \""organic\""?  Gotta get their bacon bleu cheese wedge salad -- it's a must.  Organic Bacon?  Ambience makes you feel smarter too -- or maybe I'm that already :)  Service was great, my server recommended a small since it's actually a large :)  Do \""organic\"" food appear more hmmm... - Enjoy!"
0,"Magic and comedy, what can go wrong. At this show, apperently alot. Penn and teller has lots of audience interaction but the first audience phone battery died so they said that we should believe them, then during another act one audience didnt look at the card, so they also said for sure it was the card but we dont really know. And then during another act that was shown in the dark, there was an emergency in the audience and the lights came on but the show kept going so I missed what happened during the commotion. It was professional of teller to keep on going. The magic was ok, the comedy was dry. The guy behind me loved it because he was laughing like crazy. \n\nBut it wasn't satisfactory for me, should have just watch a cirque show for the price"
1,"I usually meet my friends here for lunch as it is a good midpoint between uptown and South Charlotte. Parking can be a little tricky for this area, but I've always found a spot, somewhere close.\n\nThe line inside is always pretty quick, and there are an abundance of children during lunch time, as there is a pretty good play place attached. If you don't like children, I suggest going somewhere else. \n\nThe servers are nice and the food is good, what I've come to expect from a Chick Fil A, and have never been disappointed here."
1,"I love this place. I have been ordering pizza from here since literally the first week it opened. It is affordable and much better than anything you will get from Hungry Howies, Dominos, or Little Caesar. The best part is that they deliver $5 pizzas with only a $2 delivery fee. You get a one topping pizza for 5 dollars and they do not differentiate between what is a premium ingredient or not. For example, you can get a feta cheese pizza for the same price as a pepperoni. In the beginning the crust was a little inconsistent but now that they have gotten into a groove it is my go to place for a late night za."
1,"\""Hipster service\"" can be a frightening thought but the kids at The Crepe Bar must be majoring in culinary services. The atmosphere is laid back but there is nothing lazy about the quality of food and service. This isn't the regular chain style breakfast joint, as soon as the food arrives you can see it in the plating and most importantly, taste it."
0,"Worst customer service I've had at a tech store.  Buy a $60 hard drive replacement for a laptop that they're supposed to have put Windows 7 onto. It has been over half a year and ive receaved one single phone call to confirm that the OS is what we wanted. Now, they can't find it, we \""didn't buy it\"", we were sent a \""letter of abandonment\"". So much for their pledge to \""set up your technology, keep it running and never let you down.\"" This is pathetic and I just want to pick up the hard drive with or without the OS"
0,"we made a reervation and still had to wait an hour, This place sucks. The chicken was dry and had barely any jus on it. The steaks sucked and everything was very bland and not flavorful. Service sucked too. I recommend stk or boa. This place should shut down. Way over rated."
0,"My coworkers and I stayed at the Phoenix Airport Marriott hotel in Phoenix, Arizona in March 2012. I was sharing a room with two other female colleagues and were appalled at the service we received during our stay. We were already upset with being relocated from the Renaissance Downtown Hotel a few days prior to attending the conference and the awful customer service provided by the hotel added to our negative overall experience with the Marriott franchise. \n\nEarly Tuesday morning, two men came pounding at our door at 2 a.m. They identified themselves as a security guard and a worker at the hotel. They stated that this was our second warning and demanded that we open the door. This was quite alarming being that we never received a first warning for anything and were sincerely concerned about our safety. \n\nWhen we called the front desk to inquire if the two men standing outside were part of the staff of the hotel and to explain to guest services that we should have received a phone call from guest services in the first place, a guest relations worker by the name of Caroline asked us if we planned to continue with the noise level and responded with an unwarranted attitude that there was laughter heard from our room and someone in the room next to us called to complain. We were taken aback by her attitude because while we would have been more than happy to bring our noise level down, we did not expect a representative from guest services to be the one to talk back or respond to us in a matter that was rude and unnecessary when all we wanted to do was to explain to her about our concerns because we did not feel safe. We were extremely alarmed by the way the hotel handled the situation because we felt like our privacy was violated and our safety was jeopardized by these two strangers demanding us to open the door at 2 a.m. To make matters worse, when we brought this issue to the attention of the Front Office Manager, Camille Cobos, she simply made no effort to be apologetic or explain to us why this situation occurred. She simply brushed off our concerns and nonchalantly thanked us for bringing the matter to her attention.\n\nOur office and many of the administrators and faculty at our work frequently travel to various locations across the United States in our line of work. We often choose the Marriott as a top hotel choice for our stay. However, this awful experience at the Phoenix Airport Marriott hotel has made us question the quality of customer service their staff provides to their clientele.  Several of my colleagues also expressed other concerns regarding their stay at this particular Marriott as well. We wrote a letter to the Marriott corporation as well as to the hotel and we have they can take this important matter into consideration and provide positive experiences for current and future Marriott guests as we would not want them to have the same experience as we did. There has not been a response from any Marriott representatives so far since we sent in the letter early March."
1,"Darn good drip coffee, a very smooth iced coffee, plus the full range of expresso drinks, all made with Allann Bros coffee beans. This family business also offers a wide choice of teas brewed to order. And pastries... OK, step away from the pastry case and don't even look at the ice-chilled, fresh whipped cream dispenser unless you've fasted for the day!\nAt any time, Goldbar is a good place to meet and talk. Friday and Sunday evening, enjoy straight ahead jazz by a quintet including one of the owners on sax."
0,"Of the 13 times in the last 10 years, we've stayed here 11 times; this was our favorite hotel and casino. We love the location, the casino, the Starbucks inside- everything.\n\nChecking in has never been the most hospitable part of the trip. We understand that they're trying to get a bunch of people checked in and out simultaneously, and we don't mind waiting in the long line.\n\nWe booked our trip long before the 3PM check-in time rule, and we arrived at 8 in the morning. I asked the Manager how I might be able to pay the extra $25 dollars to check in early, and he quite rudely told me that I just couldn't check in until later. He then told me that we had to leave the lobby, and take our luggage out of it. When I asked another person what was going on, she begged me to please get my luggage out of the lobby before her Manager had a talk with her about it.\n\nWhen we were finally able to check in at 10AM, I commented on how rude the Manager was (and that everyone else was nice) and she looked worried that he might overhear me. He stood in the background frowning and shaking his head \""no\"" the entire 20 minutes we waited in the express check-in line.\n\nI HATE IT WHEN EMPLOYEES ARE SCARED OF THEIR BOSSES- this is not the way to manage staff. This is unprofessional, and does not give the customer a very good impression of how things are run.\n\nPlus- the pool is a miserly little pad of water, and all of the chairs are chained together in these creepy rows. It's just not aesthetic or comfortable to sunbathe so close to strangers. Every other hotel on the strip has a much better family-friendly pool, even the Flamingo or the Monte Carlo!\n\nWe have just booked another trip, and we're going to stay elsewhere, until we hear they've gotten their acts together."
1,"Great menu, well prepared and excellent service. A foodie joint."
0,"The fried rice appetizer was really greasy and not anything special. The menu is really confusing to someone like us that never had this type of food before. \""Chashu, Kikurage, Menma, Umeboshi, Mayu\""? What are these ingredients? the menu should explain what these are, we did understand \""green onion\"". Our server was a Spanish speaker and we could not understand what she was telling us, I am sorry, but it's the truth, she was nice, but we didn't understand her at all. We couldn't tell much difference between the pork and the chicken except for the fat on the pork. The Lobster Ramen was sold out even though we came in at 6pm. My tonkotsu broth was white and very bland. I started to put all kinds of condiments into the mix to see if I could work up the watery flavor but it ended up as a mess. My wife's broth was a salt bomb and made her feel bad afterwards. I now feel overly salty too. Simple things like the soy sauce was difficult to manage, there is a little red sticker with directions on it, but it was in Japanese so I just started to shake it and the soy sauce started to dribble out, they need to get traditional soy sauce dispensers. We really like sushi and Japanese food, but I guess this type of food is not for us. We left feeling greasy, salty and bland all at the same time. The table next to us had a bloody red center bone from the chicken wing appetizer. I am glad we didn't order that and feel sorry for the man that ate it. I love noodles, this type was not for us."
0,"There is a lot of variety but the food was not that great. The line is long but that goes for every las Vegas buffet that's in the strip. Honestly, if it wasn't for the cheap discount, I don't think anyone would go there. The service also sucked."
1,"It's been several months since I reviewed #1 Eastern here, so I made the trek back over here to see if they still deserve to be calling themselves \""#1\"" for the Eastern Valley.  Friend & fellow Yelper Mike C. joined me.\n\nWell, the long & short of it is that this is still a really great place!  Here are a few things that I jotted down during my visit today:\n\n*  The Hot & Sour Soup:  Amazing!\n\n*  Great Sushi, especially the Sara Mackerel.  (Eew, mackerel, right? Well, THIS mackerel is pickled, & it was reeeally good!)\n\n*  Delicious Egg Foo Young & gravy (& I'm fussy about it).\n\n*  One of the best Mongolian BBQs anywhere in the Valley...  super good, with SIX kinds of meat including lamb & big shrimp...  lots of good veggies too, & a really nice (ok, Chinese not Mongolian) Chef.  I just asked him to sauce mine up the way he likes his, & it was terrific!\n\n*  Absolutely 100% great service, after which I got thanked for coming 3 or 4 times on the way out!  These folks really appreciate the business, & maybe that's part of why this big place runs almost full all the time.\n\nI think #1 Eastern is still the very best in the Eastern Valley, & it's one of my favorite Chinese Buffets in all of AZ!  Make the drive!  Lunch Buffet $7.49, Sr. $6.74"
1,"Just showed up to Phoenix with a buddy looking for a place to hang out that resembled the fabled Mort's Martini Bar of Wichita, Kansas.  I'm going to be residing here for a while, so I needed a place I could call home.  Magnums is quite a good location, and while it's no Mort's, it is definitely a place I could find myself quite often.\n\nFirstly, let me tell you, finding a place where you can enjoy your cigar and a beverage at the same time is exceedingly hard to do in this modern day of social awareness and health babysitting.  If you show up at a cigar bar, you should be able to enjoy it there.  \n\nWe found this place relatively easily.  It's in a strip mall, but the interior is very comfortable.  The decor instantly made me feel welcome and at home.  The staff was welcoming as well.  They made sure to greet us as we walked in the door, and the humidor is large.  The only downside is on the day we visited a majority of our favorites had been purchased by like minded patrons.  The exterior of the place does not meet the interior.  (Insert Doctor Who \""It's bigger on the inside\"" reference.\n\nThe staff made some excellent suggestions on local brews, and if we wanted to, we could try out many of the beverages to see if we liked it before we bought it.  The selection of their beers and beverages was extensive.  \n\nSecondly, I cannot emphasize the importance for any business to focus on customer service.  The staff here had it down.  While it was a bit slow for a Friday night, the staff was eager to help, taking the opportunity to focus on the customers.  I've been to many a bar where it's a slow night and the bar staff is too busy goofing off to pay attention to you.  These guys were professional.\n\nThirdly, if you find yourself stranded in the beautiful deserts of Arizona, make sure and visit this place.  It's worth your time.  I will be back, and it's earned a five star from me.  Glad to have been here!\nThirdly,"
0,The food is good but the service is awfull. Seems like they're always shortstaff. I've been there 3 times and everytime we have an issue with the service. You place your order with the waiter/waitress and just takes to getyour food. Last time i waited 45 minutes and we decided to leave because the waitress came back and told us that for some reason the order was not put in the system. \nNot coming back to this particular Applebees.
1,"So yesterday as I was sitting at my desk salivating about getting myself a Naco Torta at Gallo Blanco, then picked up Sara debating on whether to go to Ticoz or Gallo Blanco, we found ourselves at the Parlor. I have to admit, what I was craving was nowhere close to where we ended up with but both Sara and I have always wanted to try out the Parlor after hearing so many good things about it that we finally did it and I am glad! whew! \n\nSo, first impressions - It's a Wednesday night, parking lot is full which is always a good sign, the entrance with the fireplace facing the patio, and the smell of pizza wafting from the kitchen sets up a good evening for dining out. The host staff were quite friendly (no attitudes there *yay*), and the chalk board on the wall with their daily specials looked good. I have to say that the overall interiors of this place is so comfy, yet spacey... I just love it! \n\nI ordered a blueberry shake because I saw it as one of their fruit specials of the day plus I read somewhere that it's good for men's health and I also needed my calcium too! And we also ordered the frito misto which I agree with others was not that great... it was good but the portion was too small but just right for two persons. So, Sara and I were deciding on what pizzas we'd get to share, so we settled on the Yukon Gold Potato and the Salsiccia. \n\nBetween the two pizzas we shared... I totally loved the Yukon... it was just yummy!!! loved the potato and the Gorgonzola and the leeks mmmmmmm! The Salsiccia was good, the sausage was yum but the radish totally screwed with your taste buds. It had a bitter taste that totally reminded me of arugula but nonetheless it was good. Loved the crust... it was crisp and loved the toasted burnt taste. So here we were satisfied with our pizza selections, enjoyed the attentive service of our many servers, took in the atmosphere of the place, and I kept on eyeing the dolci people were ordering around us. I know I know I should have ordered the Tiramisu but when your server tells you that they have an in-house pastry chef and sells the apple crostada and mentions her other favorite is the chocolate cake, one's reaction would be is to listen to the recommendation and go for the apple crostada. SO we did, we gave in and got ourselves the crostada. I will liken this review to a potential break up scene in which a couple goes on a date and everything seems fine and well until the guy or girl gets caught flirting with another brad or buffy next door... what starts as a good evening gets muzzled up with a bad incident well let's say this bad incident was the crostada. Mind you, I am not in any way an exceptional baker but I admit to being a fan of the best pastries ever presented to me thanks to close family friends, a husband and wife team that are pastry chefs themselves and work in two top tier international hotels. Like what Sara said, that crostada was not a flaky pastry... it was like bread with an apple topping. I liked it since it wasn't that sweet but the apples were too tart and with a dry crust, the only thing to enjoy was the scoop of vanilla gelato. So a no go with the crostada and sadly I was disappointed by the in-house pastry chef... maybe next time I'll get the Tiramisu. \n\nSo overall, it was a good experience at the Parlor, a place that I can see myself returning in the near future with friends and family. The dessert was not memorable in any way except that it was dry and I can't wait to try out the other pizzas or the Seafood Linguine. So four forks for the Parlor!"
0,"BEWARE!!  This dealership trashed my car after the transmission locked up and had to be replaced with only 4129. miles on it and it's a '09 CC.  These losers put a dent in passenger side door, damaged the leather drivers seat and returned the car filthy to me...then tried to tell me that it was ME who damaged my own car!!  So Pathetic!  NEVER again will I own a Volkswagen!!  I'm going back to Lexus or Volvo."
0,"I like this place. As a number of other people have mentioned, the chips and salsa are great. The horchata is also delicious and they give you free refills (utter madness but I love it). However, it wasn't the best mexican I've had, not even close to the top 5. For whatever reason, I was craving enchiladas. They did not turn out well. The sauce that came on the enchilada tasted like it was from a can. just terrible. My girlfriend's meal was much better. She had two steak tacos that looked pretty tasty. She really enjoyed  her meal. I'll be back to see if they just misfired on the enchiladas.\n\nUpdate: I came back and ordered the fish tacos. they were not good. won't be back."

0,"***UPDATE***\nAfter posting the following review, I was contacted via Yelp by a person calling herself \""Kate G.\"". Kate stated, \""I would like to get your phone number so that our corporate side can look into this and discuss.\"" I asked Kate G. who she was & she stated she was Landry's Social Media Coordinator. Why didn't you tell me that in your first e-mail? Ummm, I don't hand out my phone number to random internet contacts!\nWhy on earth would I give my phone number to Kate? Does she think I want to be bothered my her or Corporate? I can't be bought off with a gift certificate from Landry's. I will never eat there again. I filed a complaint with the Southern Nevada Health District!!! So, listen up Kate G., you can NOT have any of my personal information. May I suggest you introduce yourself before asking for someone's phone number. BTW, I still have nightmares over what happened to me! \n\nI got so ill after eating here I thought I would die. Never again! I had a steak, loaded potato, green beans & one glass of wine. I'll have PTSD whenever I think of that night."
0,Disappointing ! to say the least. The bisque was watery with no lobster pieces and the lobster salad was small with a vinegarette salad dressing that ruined what was poor to begin with. I usually try to give places the benefit of the doubt but I was truly disappointed in this spot as a former New Englander.
1,"I was leaving the vet's office yesterday and spied this place out of the corner of my eye and did a U-turn. It has been so long since we had a Greek/Mediterranean place in the area, I HAD to stop even tho' I'm dieting. Spotless inside with a great vibe. The owner, (oh I'm sorry I'm not sure, but I think ) John is adorable and one of the most delightful people I've come across in a rest. In a long time. He hand makes the hummus and taziki. I was just going to get some hummus, but I broke down and ordered the hummus AND a Gyro to go. It was over an hour before I was able to eat the Gyro and I was sure it would be a soggy mess, but no! It was even still hot! I took a bite before I set the table, but it was so good I finished it in seconds right there at the kitchen counter. I would have liked more onions and tomato on it, but I'm sure asking for extras won't be a problem next time. Was going to wait until today to eat the hummus (remember..dieting) but I took a bite just to try it. Ate that all up to. Perfection! I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu., especially the Philly cheese steak. From his description, it's made the RIGHT way! Well, I've missed 9 mo.of deliciousness, but I do plan on making up for it! Oh, did I mention the dirt cheap prices?"
1,"Came here during the wine walk. I'm not exactly sure when it opened, but I know it must've been recently. \n\nThe crew members are very friendly and knowledgeable. The menu has a lot of items ranging from white choco mocha, caramel apple cider, mocha coconut frappe, lattes, and smoothies. I ended up just getting a refreshing iced tea (it seems like that's all I've been getting at coffee shops lately). I wanted a frappe, but I didn't feel like spending $3.95 on a small that was going to melt the second I walked out the doors. I took a seat and enjoyed their free wifi for about 20 minutes, before they closed at 8pm :/\n\nEven though I was only there for 20 minutes, I already knew I liked it. The shop is very spacious, there are a lot of tables, and the internet is fast! I also noticed they have a lot of pastries and even parfaits. I liked that there weren't many people there because it made for a calm ambiance. Next time I come, I'll definitely try their coffee. The aroma was pretty sexy..."
1,"The Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix, AZ is a great way to get a sample of Arizona's diverse and spectacular flora.  Check out The Gardens in the spring, when all of the plant and flowers are blooming in beautiful, vibrant colors.  This is a great place to take visiting relatives who love to garden or are just nature buffs.   It's an easy walking adventure with many cozy benches to sit and bird or nature watch.  Midway through the journey is a nice spot to enjoy a little refreshment and sample some yummy treats.  At the end of your journey is a great gift shop with books, jewelry and even plants found on the garden grounds for sale.  Visit when the day time temperatures are moderate and you're guaranteed to have an enjoyable time.  Be sure to wear sunscreen and bring a camera.  Don't forget to have fun!"
1,"What is there a better way to gain couple more pounds after dinner at Windsor, go next door to Churn!  I was so full after dinner, but couldn't resist the unique ice cream flavors, retro candies, vintage/silly toys, and bakery goodies all displayed around Churn.  My Niece had the Peach and Honey ice cream.  She didn't like it at all.  The pure honey overpowered the peach taste, which sounded good but was too sweet.   I had the traditional butter pecan ice cream sandwich.  You get to select from the baked cookies on the counter and the ice cream flavor.  Unfortunately, the ice cream wasn't frozen so it melted too quickly on a hot summer day.   I will probably wait until it's a little cooler to try other flavors on a pretzel cone."
1,Excellent atmosphere that really screams vegas. It's a great way to kick off your trip. Their shakes are to die for. Typically we get a burger and split the Cobb salad.
0,"Not worth it!! We bought tickets online for $80 only.to find out everyone at the Mgm was getting free vip tickets with free drinks just by walking by a girl handing out wrist bands. We were so excited for the show and the show was basically every 30 minutes for only 2 minutes of showtime, with the same two little people Everytime. Must've been the only ones they paid for the night. When we got there with the tickets we were told to take them back to the ticket office and get our money back. We had bought them on ticketmaster so returning them wasn't an option. What's the point in selling $80 tickets if they're useless?? Very Dissapointed in our experience. Nothing like the LA one. Giving it two stars for the free drinks that were a good pregame for hakkassan...but don't worry, just walk through the Mgm for those.."
1,"Crab cakes outshined the steaks, but not to take away from the steaks because they were very good. We came in with a large part of 13 or so and they sat us in our own sectioned off room which oddly had some TV's in the corners. The service was excellent, we had a few issues with overcooked fish and a tuna tare tare coming out instead of a steak one we requested. \nThis is a fine steakhouse with great service which is well worth the short drive off the strip to come to. They did a great job with such a large group of rowdy guys."
1,"We only go here for their Walnut Chicken Salad sandwich and cookies. I should probably reverse the order of that because the cookies are the real treat and we always take advantage of their two for one cookies.  A pet peeve we have is that the staff is trained to remind people that they already get a chocolate chip cookie with their sandwich  when they order an EXTRA chocolate chip cookie, so it is always like a \""who's on first\"" banter until they figure out we really do want EXTRA chocolate chip cookies. Their staff seems to turn over a lot here so it is hard to deprogram them. We stop here EVERY time we are headed out of town anywhere near lunch time. Paradise is like a treat we look forward to before we get on an airplane. If we are running late, we just get it to go and eat on the airplane and make everyone jealous that they did not stop at Paradise too...especially when we pull the cookies out of the bag! Yum! They have recently opened another satellite location in Terminal 4 out by the C11-20 gates. We usually stop at the main one on Level 3."
1,"For \""out of towners\"" this was an absolute treat!  Easy to find, great parking, great food, price and service!  Our kids had a blast as well. We enjoyed the bonsai dinner which had plenty of sushi for two. The price was unbeatable. Wish we had a place like this close to home. If you're not sure, go!\nWell worth the money and a delicious dinner to boot."
0,"I have been to elements three times; the first time was excellent, the second time was good enough, and the third time was so awful I feel the need to ward off anyone else from visiting this restaurant.\n\nWe had two good experiences with elements, so when we saw a groupon for a four-course tasting menu, we bought it without hesitation.  Side note: our first excellent experience included the tasting menu. He ordered the four course, while I ordered a salad and entree.  His four courses were full of delicious food that was enough to feed us both.  Neither of us were able to finish our meals, and we left full and happy!  But tonight, our tasting menu options and delivery were beyond disappointing.\n\nWe decided to sit at the bar tonight.  When we sat down we were eyed down by the female bartender who reluctantly took our order.  She didn't bother to tell us the specials, which we later overheard her share with other customers, and she didn't ask if we were interested in any food.  Before we were finished with our drinks, she brought over our check; were we being rushed out of this NOT crowded bar?  I had a bad feeling, and I wish I would have trusted my gut to leave.  We asked her for another round and let her know we were going to order dinner and had a groupon.\n\nOur service was bad before we told her we had a groupon, and it only spiraled down from there.  But bad service I can handle, it was the food that made me jump onto yelp!  The tasting menu was for family style service so we had to pick the same four items for dinner.  Family style?  This is different than last time, I thought.... Our first course was a variety of meats, cheeses, and olives.  It was a much smaller portion than he had during our first visit to elements, but who needs to over eat meat and cheese anyway?  The second course was a beat and goat cheese salad.  The salad was large and more than enough for two people (aka filler).  When our entree arrived I almost fell off of my barstool.  There was one filet of salmon for the two of us to share.  It wasn't a monstrous sized salmon as big as my head, it wasn't two of my fists, it was a small piece of salmon meant to feed both of us.  I am mortified that I didn't call attention to this at the restaurant, but I couldn't believe that I had been served a 'family style' portion of salmon that included only one piece of fish.  WHAT?  Dessert wasn't memorable, but what I do remember is not being asked if I wanted coffee to accompany it either.\n\nI'm not even mentioning in detail the bartender's awkward comments that we cleaned our plates during our meal or that another bartender knocked over my glass of wine. Please, don't go to elements.  There are too many better restaurants in Pittsburgh to waste anymore thought on this dump.\n\n\nNote to restaurants: If you don't like people who use groupons, then please don't invite us into your restaurant only to treat us poorly. Like I said earlier, this was our third visit to Elements.  We bought the groupon because we were repeat customers, we liked the restaurant, and now we will never go back.\n\n**UPDATE**\nI followed up with Groupon and Elements.  Groupon refunded our money with no problem at all.  When I called Elements, they said the owner wanted to speak to me after reading my review on yelp, but he wasn't available.  He called me back once, and I returned the call.  I haven't heard back anything."
1,My fifth time here. I finally weened my way from the Kiki burger and had the Spicy Miso burger. Both are delish. Added some truffle fries to the mix and a Green Milk Tea and I was set.\nNext time; the Ronin and sweet potato fries!
1,Must try the food!
1,"I went there for the first time this past Saurday, taking advantage of the nice weather by sitting on the patio.  I really enjoyed the experience!  The host and servers were very friendly and knowledgeable, and they took wonderful care of us.  We started with the crostini boa, which was an assortment of 4 crostini, each topped differently.  The difference between great tomatoes and no-so-great ones is huge .... these were delicious and bursting with great flavor.  Then I had the homemage beef lasagna .....excellent and enough to fill me up and take some home.  I am not a huge dessert eater, but my guest was and we opted for the butter cake (although we weren't sure what to expect.)  Upon first bite, we both looked at each other for an OMG moment.  It was warm, delicious, and very memorable.  We had a great time, and I would definitely go back!"
0,"I am third generation Korean born in Hawaii and miss real good Korean food.  I was used to Cho Dang in Chandler where my favorite was the Bhi Pam Pap (Korean Fried Rice) in the hot stone bowl and the little dishes of kim chee but was severely disappointed with Takamatsu on Dunlap in PHX when I order the same thing.  Hardly any meat, chopped lettuce filler was used and the stone bowl was not HOT enough to scorch the rice on the bottom.  I didn't know of any other Korean restaurant to go to near me in PHX so went again when I was hungry for kal bi ribs, I paid unknowingly $26.95 for the dinner portion so I could get the little dishes of kim chee and I got around 5-6 little band aid size pieces of meat over onions with 2 very large bones that had little or no meat to pick off, and the stone platter WAS NOT sizzling.  They don't take the extra measure of getting it right, will not go there again, googled PHX Korean restaurants and found another on on West Olive Avenue Cafe Ga Hyang near Takamatsu, just returned, food great but service was so SLOOOOWWWWW!  When I asked for a refill on the kim chee dishes she said they don't refill and reluctantly did so for just 2 kim chee's. But the stone bowl was SIZZLING HOT and the rice scorched and lots of BBQ meat, the best yet is Kim Chee Time in Tucson, they have a killer Bhi Pam Pab with a special mixture of rices that is to die for which gets so crispy it's insane and no problem refilling kim chee pun cheon little dishes.  If anyone knows of anywhere else to try for good Korean food in PHX pleas let me know."
0,The food is overpriced for what you get. Our waiter charged us 3.00 for chips and salsa but never told us it wasn't free. My sister's 2 tacos (for 7.00 and no sides) were so small they could be considered appetizers. My burrito for 11.00 was a decent size but does not come with any sides for that price.The service was okay but not great. I won't be rushing back there.
1,I got vegan meatball! Yeah !!!
0,"A very expensive place for a americanized Indian food. First sign that this is not a \""TRUE\"" indian experience came when they were playing some middle-eastern music. The Mango Marghareita was good -but was also very expensive. Food was definitely bland. My colleagues enjoyed most of what was brought out there. But the food was real mild.\nOne thing about the service though - as someone else had mentioned here - the waiter just kept pushing us to order more- both in terms of food and drink. One of the ladies was almost ready to take a half-full glass of mango margherita away so she could bring another drink. \nVery expensive Indian experience.."
0,"Park anywhere else but here. Tth Street Ripoff.\n\nComplete ripoff and they charge the maximum daily rate regardless of how long you actually park there. I asked the lot \""cashier\"" to do the math on how much 90 minutes cost at $2.00/20 minutes and he just kept pointing at the sign, telling me it was $14 in broken English.  Ridiculous.  He just kept pointing and saying over and over , \""14, 14 dollars.\""  \n\nNever again.  Walk a few more steps and park at one of the $6 surface lots all day for less than half the cost."
0,"Eggs are bad other food is pretty good.\n\nThis place is nothing special, they try and are friendly but the eggs are gross, as is the coffee. Home Fries and such are pretty decent.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and homey and very country. Seats are comfortable and no real complaints. But for the most part the food is bad. I will not return intentionally"
0,"Absolutely horrible. The front of the hotel was under constriction and they didnt tell is that when we booked. My husband and I reserved a king bed, and instead we got two doubles. When I called down to\nAsk about it, they said they \""didnt have anything available\"" even tho we booked\nOur trip 3 months in advance. Their solution was to give us one the next day in the smoking section. The bathtub had black hair all over it, and the glasses provided for us has lipstick stains on them, the floor wasnt vacuumed either. My\nHusband called this time\nTo complain and they offered us a $30 food credit. We ended up staying one night out of 4 in the hotel and got\nA refund. This place is a joke."
0,"My family was in town, staying at Paris so we were craving a late night snack after drinking all day. I had a slice of the supreme which was extremely too greasy and almost impossible to eat because it just fell apart when I picked it up. The place is kinda dirty too.. Felt like I needed to bathe after being there :/"
1,"My favorite store around here :) The staff is so friendly and helpful.  Its a very inviting, happy atmosphere.  I have found its also the least crowded at night so that is when I prefer to shop! My only recommendation would be for them to carry more produce, especially fruits because I typically have to stop by Sprouts on the way home to get some.  Other than that, great store and I love going!"
0,"We went last night for Valentines day and I felt embarrassed for making the arrangements there as the experience was awful. We booked through Open Table over a week prior and was given a confirmation, so you would think that it wouldn't take close to 15 minutes for them to find our reservation when we arrived.\n\nWe were then sat in Carlos section. Took awhile for us to be greeted and then My mother in law ordered water with lemon, no lemons were given. But hey no big deal! We all ordered steaks and it comes with a starch and salad. Felt the pricing was good for what's included compared to other steak houses.\n\nSalads arrived, only table not given croutons, but then again, that is not anything to really complain about! Main courses were delivered and waiter said he will stop by in just a few to make sure everything was ok. Well we didn't receive the extra side dishes we ordered, steaks were under seasoned, and over cooked. The waiter, nor anyone else checked by or was in the vicinity to let them know. So we just ate our mediocre food, the waiter finally came by as we were finished to ask if we wanted a box. Also refills on drinks... Forget about it!!\n\nGetting a box was another 10 minute wait, and then getting the check was about another 10 minutes. Of course the check also reflected all the food we never received. The bill was corrected though and we then left.\n\nBeing that I have been in the service industry for many years, I can honestly say that I can tolerate a lot of errors or oversight by wait staff or kitchen as places can get busy. Not one aspect of this dinner was acceptable and the server didn't even seem that busy with other tables. \n\nReally sad about this as the restaurant has great potential."
1,"the wife and I stopped by around noon to rent SUP for an hour. we thought it would be just an easy walk up, but come to find out, this thing is really popular! we were put on a wait list and came back about an hour later to begin our SUP'ing. \n\nthe girl at the reservation was kind and sweet and was actually apologetic for the long wait. we walked over to the dock and the guy there gave us a quick lesson for the SUP and we were off. it's not hard, well...not on Tempe Town Lake anyway. \n\nthe rentals were 20 bucks/hour which included the paddle. don't ding or lose the board or paddle...it's expensive to replace! the boards are decent, though not anything wicked cool, but they were fun to just enjoy a day out on the lake. \n\nyou don't really need shoes or flip flops. they will let you store any gear you brought in their office, but really you just need a sunhat, sunglasses, and swimsuit...\n\nreturn was just as easy as renting. if you have to wait, no biggie....mill ave is 5 minute walk away!"
0,"Had lunch here,  ate the lobster roll. Can't taste the lobster. No presentation at all. Worst of all,  I got very sick afterwards. Ruined my whole vacation. This is what happens when you get too big and famous. You can't possibly know what all your restaurants are doing. Sad! You can't even pay me to eat here again. Everyone in my party were disappointed."
1,"I thought this was going to be like an average Cirque Du Soleil show and I've seen a bunch of them.  But it wasn't average at all.  It was amazing!!  I was blown away by it.  I don't want to give too much away but the stage was so cool.  I would definitely recommend this show to everyone.  Also, don't take your seat right away.  Stay outside and a little before the show, performers come out and play the World's Largest Harp.  It's located outside the bar, you have to look up.  It was pretty cool.  Overall, one of the best things I've ever done in Vegas (and I've been dozens of times)."
1,"My boyfriend and I have dined here twice! We absolutely love it. The first time, we were with a vegetarian group (his family is indian) and the P.U.B. was very accommodating! We will defiantly be going back. Their salads are just Meh... But what else should I expect from a Pub?? I wont hold that against them since their french fries are sooo yummy :)"

1,Never eaten here but the beer is some of the best. The Saison is to die for!
1,"I'm not all that much of a girly girl, but I will say this: I've learned one of the most important relationships in your life is with your hair stylist. So imagine my devastation when mine moved away 5 years ago. If you've ever had to search for a new salon, you know it's not easy. It's hard to trust a stranger with your hair. (And if you've ever had a bad experience.. it's just that much harder. TWSS)\n\nMy friend Emilee recommended her stylist: Erica at Salon 42 (the Dilworth location). Emilee has more hair than anyone else I know... so I figured hey, if she can tame that lovely blonde head of hair... she can do anything. :)\n\nErica does a great job. She takes the time for a thorough consultation before pulling out the scissors and dye. I trust her completely and always leave happy. I also recommend Corey. My entire group of girlfriends now go here. I'm pretty sure Emilee's weekly trips are what pays their electric bill.\n\nThe prices are comparable to other salons in Charlotte. If you book an appointment.. tell them Nikki sent you!"
1,"Seriously my favorite fast Mexican food in Las Vegas. I've been eating at this location since I first moved her about 8 years ago. Same amazing quality since. I don't understand people on here saying the service is bad, every time I walk in I get amazing quick service. I know there is a language barrier with many of the employees so some may take their demeanor as rude but they're just trying to do their job. I prefer this place over chipotle any day. Quality food that's always hot and always fresh. I also love the seating area here and usually stay to eat there. Also don't forget to grab a brownie on your way out, they're delicious and only a dollar WOW. Would recommend this place to anyone!"
0,"I recently went for brunch due to hype from one of my co-workers.  I did not like much about my experience.  It started with what I think is an obscure way to get to the restaurant, to the wait, to so so food.  I am certain the Illy coffee downstairs is much better than what I had upstairs.  The breakfast was basic fare and included what I considered a overbaked chocolate almond croissant.  My girlfriend did like her waffle.  Ultimately, I left undazzled by ambiance, food and service.  I went back downstairs thinking maybe I should have just tried a chocolate croissant from the bakery."
0,Good food...but won't return because they sell shark fin items. And I don't believe in finning a shark and because I don't know how it was harvested (properly or not) I won't be returning to eat there.
1,"After procrastinating for far too long I finally made the switch to All Star and could not be happier.  My kids were at a much larger practice before where we were always treated like strangers.  Our second visit to All Star the doctor asked how my daughter was doing from her previous visit, it was just so foreign to me for a pediatrician to be so personable.  Their one girl at the counter is far more friendly than the seven the other practice had.  I cannot say enough good things about this office."
1,One of the perks at staying at the Palms is getting comp'd for many of our food. So we decide to try their buffet which was Bistro. The prime rib was cooked a medium well so it wasn't too bad but not great. It wasn't too tough to chew and it did have tons of flavor.. maybe because I put tons of aui ju and salt. =) Their sushi selection wasn't great but the ones they had were tasty. I felt they could have put more sushi in stead of having the roll be 85% rice. The snow crab legs were great...very sweet and easy to open. Their desert area was pretty good. Their eclairs were good especially with the ice cream. Our server was fast and refilled our drinks constantly.
0,"Work at townsquare and was there for lunch and it was a terrible experience.  Let's begin.\n1: Ordered buffalo wings and they were raw, I cut into one with a knife and it started dripping blood.  Manager apologized telling me he wouldn't charge me for the wings that were raw and I didn't eat, like he was doing me a favor. (I sent them back and cancelled the wings all together) \n2: My co-worker ordered a french dip with no onion and they brought one packed with onions but my burger had zero onions.\n3:Other co-worker ordered a salad and didn't come with any dressing at all. \nWe were offered a free dessert for the terrible experience and I asked them to just discount the cost of the dessert from our bill, our waiter was not too happy about that and said \""we are not charging you for the wings already what else would you want us to do?\"" No sh$&t you actually thought I was going to pay for food I didn't eat?  They ended up applying the discount to the bill but it had to be the worst place in townsquare I have ever eaten at.  I normally go to Tommy Bahammas and food/service is incredible maybe we should have Tommy Bahamas trainers go and teach Ale house how to cook and treat customers.  You lost our business and won't be recommending you to any of 600+ employees we work with."
0,I can only give it to stars .I was so disappointed we ordered sandwiches for delivery they were very nice and the delivery man was very friendly and they were fast. The bread was horrible .my last time ordering from there .
1,"i love frozen yogurt. \nwhat is there not to love about a frozen treat for under 100 calories. \nthat being said, golden spoon is a staple. \n\nit is the standard of frozen yogurt. almost the original. it's yummy, it's cheap and they have good toppings. \nthey don't go below or beyond my expectations. \n\nmy favorite combo: java and chocolate with almond roca topping. \nseriously almond roca is the BEST TOPPING EVER!!!! \n\nand i have a buy 8 and get 1 free card. \ni've pretty much have gone through three cards since it opened right down the street."

0,"so a friend was in town from LA, and she wanted to go here and have me order a grilled cheese (burger without a burger) 'cause \""they are soooo good\"".  And being a vegetarian, I decided that her \""sooooo good\"" statement was true.  OK, so we arrive -- the place is PACKED.  I mean, it's more packed than a line outside Tiger's MGM hotel room.  So seriously, an HOUR wait for the food.  And people were hovering over tables -- waiting for someone to leave.  NO JOKE.  Then the food arrived.  The \""grilled cheeses\"" were awful.  The fries were on the cold side, and nothing special.  Are people NUTS?  Why is this place so popular?!?!?!  I swear sometimes."
1,"After finding a parking spot at the very top of their tiny, old school parking garage, I made my way through the smoky, outdated casino into the depths of the casino floor to find the caf\u00e9. I believe I was in the minority age group based on the clientele I walked past, and probably the only person in the entire building without a cigarette in my hand. Caf\u00e9 Cortez features the same bland ceiling tiles, muted paint colors and basic yet functional light fixtures that decorate the rest of the casino, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The space is quite large, filled with many 2 and 4 person tables, and probably gets pretty packed late night after First Friday. Even during my lunch time visit the place was fairly populated. The menu offers pretty much any type of food option as you would expect from your typical casino caf\u00e9, and serves up a pretty great matza ball soup. \n\nAs advertised on their website I came to try their $5 burger deal, which comes with a 1/2lb Caf\u00e9 Cortez burger, chips and 12oz domestic draught beer. What is served is basically your simple back yard burger, but really good. The char flavor was prominent; the patty was of the more generic variety but really good overall. The LTO and pickles were all fresh, the bun was basic but perfectly fine as well. In all this is nothing gourmet, but certainly better than some places that try to tout a much fancier burger, and certainly fine for $5.\n\nI wasn't initially thrilled about getting chips over my go-to fries, but after having a few of my friends I thought twice about that. The fries weren't quite shoe string, but a little too small and not that great to accompany any burger. The chips were of your generic Lays variety, and served their purpose just fine in this case. This meal is certainly not intending to be anything fancy or out of this world, but they still make an effort to serve something of good quality and not overcharge you for it as some casinos might. This is definitely better and cheaper than what is served down the street at Binion's, and also probably more acceptable than what's served at Park on Fremont because it includes a full beer for only $5. So if you're looking for a cheap late night meal, or just an old school Vegas scene downtown, definitely check out Caf\u00e9 Cortez."
1,"If you don't want to go to bed drunk on an empty stomach while staying at the Valley Ho, I highly recommend the fries with the sriracha aoli! If you're still not drunk enough, order a dirty martini while you wait for your fries."
0,"Stopped in here to grab some dog food with the free dog food coupon (to drop off at a rescue), saw a young, hippie-ish couple in the store holding a kitten and a small trash can speaking with a store employee... I grabbed the food and went to the checkout counter. Something about the interaction between the employee and the couple made me sidle closer and I overheard the employee tell them that he didn't have time to make any calls for them, that they had to go. The couple left and I asked the employee what was going on. He said they were homeless, picked up kitten off street, had dreams of traveling the country with the kitten, have realized that this won't work, said he can't take the cat and that he didn't have time to call around, and that they're just stupid. \n\nMaybe certainly so, naive is what it appeared to be after I met them. I couldn't believe the callousness as he sent them out in 105 degree heat onto a busy road during rush hour with an unrestrained kitten in their arms. How long until the kitten squirmed away, ran into the street with the kids (legally adults, kids to me, I'm old) running behind them, cars everywhere nailing their brakes, hitting each other, hitting people and/or the kitten... Seriously? You can't even offer them the use of a phone and a list of phone numbers to rescues? You can't offer to hold the kitten and call animal control? You can't let them sit for a few minutes in a side room to cool off, collect their thoughts? I can NOT see this happening at a PetSmart or a Petco, I've seen the opposite too many times.  \n\nI ran outside, offered to make calls, saw the desperation in their eyes and I took the kitten. Walked back into the store, imposed on the employees to get me a box and hold the kitten while I put it together/ran out  to get my phone, etc.   \n\nNote to employees... these animals are your livelihood or at least your part time income if nothing else. You should at least act like you care."
0,"I need to preface that I've been to this location two other times and had 3-star experiences.\n\nThis last time though.. .if I could give a 0 I would.\n\n- We sat there for 45 minutes before I finally had to ask our waitress what the deal was with our food (there were three meals ordered and other tables had sat, eaten, and left already).\n\n- When confronting the waitress she offered free beer while we wait which sounded nice... until they were dumped into my lap while she sat there astonished.\n\n- When the food finally came out I realized that there was a distinct black hair in my orange chicken that did not belong to any of us... I about lost my cool after sitting there for an hour without so much as an apology.\n\nFinally after sending back the food, the owner comes over and tells me that my meal is going to be free, in which I tell her that our entire dining experience is going to be free and if she doesn't like it, too f-ing bad.  She didn't even come back and talk to us but sent the waitress back over to tell us that everything was free.\n\n1.5 hours, jeans soaking wet from beer, and leaving without food?  I will NOT be attending this place again.\n\nThe service has sucked EVERY TIME I've gone here.\n\nMy Wendy's Club Sandwich on the way home was delicious."
0,Mediocre.   Wonton soup as best thing I had.  Ordered sesame chicken and it was deep fried ---yuck!  Fiance ordered chicken chop suey which was salty. Not worth the drive to east Mesa.
0,"Second time around, I decided on a grande iced Americano.  I felt bad because the barista was the only one working, and a line quickly formed with hurried business people.  I had to wait longer than I'd prefer at 8 am on a Friday morning.  Seriously, shouldn't there be more employees during peak hours?  \n\nThe Americano itself was filled with too much ice, and even after I doctored it up with some cream and Splenda, it tasted overwhelmingly bitter.  I added more cream when I got to the office, but the bitterness was still there in full-force.  I understand that espresso turns bitter within a few minutes, but I've ordered Americanos before and they usually don't taste THAT bitter.  I much prefer AJ's iced Americano over Tully's; not only does it taste better, but it's cheaper per ounce.  And there are multiple people working so you don't have to wait as long.  \n\nI'm sorry Tully's, I guess I'll just stick to the sugar free iced mocha."
1,"My husband is an avid BBQer.  We just moved to Scottsdale with our Grand Turbo cart bbq.  It was in deep need of repair and refurbishing.  The \""guru\"" replaced burners and igniters, repaired valves, and cleaned up years of use.  Now, it's like having a brand new grill.  Thank you, Guru, for your great customer service -- always timely and reliable."
0,"I've been going to Pita Jungle since it was a twee, one-room hovel on Apache, back when we had to walk uphill in the snow with no shoes for eight miles and shit. Seriously, I'm a long-time devotee. Back when I worked at that Planned Parenthood next door, it was 1000 Beans for lunch... every day. (Many apologies to my former co-workers and patients.)\n\nSo I've watched the gradual growth of PJ with some interest. Who doesn't want to see a locally-owned business thrive? When I saw the latest installment of the Great PJ Takeover occur in the form of a food court presence at Fashion Square, however, I have to admit I was somewhat befuddled. The dirty dreadlock crowd, attempting to permeate the premium-gas-only-SUV Louis Vuitton crowd? Doesn't this shit only happen in the movies?\n\nI've been to this location twice now, both times out of desperation - staunch refusal to eat excrement from Panda Express versus inability to maintain attention span long enough to wait in line at Paradise. I had a falafel salad that was just covered in the most rank and odiferous onions known to mankind. My second visit, I wised up and got the falafel sandwich-no-onions, which was wrapped in a half-reheated and totally dried out pita and covered in said devil onions. Now, mind you, lunch and a pop there will easily put you out $10. That's too much money to leave unsatisfied, with roaring heartburn and breath that would singe Satan's chest hair off.\n\nPlus, the people taking orders are impatient and a little snotty. Sorry if you've run out of patience trying to explain falafel to Middle America. Please don't take it out on everyone else.\n\nThree times may be a charm, but I don't think I'll be back to this location..."
1,They have great food! Always clean in the store and you can even call ahead your order so you don't have to wait while they cook it fresh! Its not to long of a wait but at times it can be so to have this option available I love! This location is VERY hard to find though! More signs!!!!
0,"Have to say my first experience was not a great one of Chestnut. Came here for two things, grab a latte and Camelback Flower Shop. One, the flower shop was closed, not sure that makes any sense on a weekend. I love the Camelback Flower Shop, but they really should be open on Sundays at Chestnut. Second, and this is my reason for the 2 stars, the service is horrible here. With only 2 of us in line how can ordering and receiving a latte take 20 minutes. The staff runs around like they're lost and there is no communication. Employees would rather talk to each other than acknowledge they have a customer waiting to order. I really don't think I will ever go here again. Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee."
1,"The food at this chain has always been consistently good. Our server in downtown (where we spent New Year's) was new, but that did not impact our service at all. She was prompt and attentive to our needs."

Terribly weak drinks, warm draft beer.! And awful management, and I thank they are to blame!.... Support your regulars,  and we might start coming back!!"
0,Mikkie Finnz's sister bar next door. The food is almost as horrible.  The fish and chips suck and so does the whole menu. DO not eat here.
0,"I like fish and I like fish tacos so I thought this would be a no brainer. For the money you really don't get much, and it was mostly fried fish in a tortilla anyway. I'd say skip it and go to a legit Mexican place for fish."
1,"The coffee rubbed short rib here KICKS ASS. Great food, great little find in Scottsdale."
1,Food was good as always. It was pretty busy all the available tables were dirty. Let manager know he cleaned a table for us right away. Then our food took longer than it should have to get out. I am giving 4 stars because even though there was issues the manager recognized it without us complaining and gave us free entree certificates and was very apologetic.
1,"I've been meaning to write a review of this awesome bar. Previous to my first actual drinking experience at the Roosevelt, I had been there during First Fridays. Bad decision. It's a small craftsman converted house so couple it with its popularity, the masses and its location smack dab by the Roosevelt street fair this place was packed. \n\nI love that you walk in through the door into a room where you see a small bar with 4 stools, in the first room there's a table for two, and a sofa chair. The back room has a long table for 6. and the side rooms have three table that can see 2 to 3 ppl each, and the other street facing room can fit 2 groups of maybe 4 at most each. So you can imagine of FF it's a little claustrophobic. Anywho, I made a mental note to come back. So I went on a Thursday evening and that evening I was craving a grilled cheese and I heard about the most amazing things about the grilled cheese with tomato soup, so I ordered it with a true pint of belgian witte. OMFG... that grilled cheese was YUM! and a deep bowl of steaming tomato soup! with a real cold true pint of belgian witte that mind you when even with a third left the glass and beer was still cold. AMAZING! not sure how they do that but 4 peaks take note por favor! The server had a wine deal where she's said if you ordered a wine bottle and consumed more than 2 glasses that they would charge the bottle for 50% less. fun stuff. I just have to say it was kinda dark but it would make a great place to bring a special someone and enjoy each other's company. Friends work too =P Overall loved the Roosevelt and will return... Oh and let's say their menu had both sides filled with all the beers they offered... I think more than 50 to 60 or so! love it... an ode to you the Roosevelt!"
0,Went there to get my stone on my wedding band replaced. They said they didn't have the stone on stock that it had to be ordered that it would be done in 3 days.  So I told them I well give them a week done I don't live in the area. Lady says it will definitely be done by then.  Went there today to pick up my ring and the lady couldn't find it. Why? Because they never fixed it because the stone didn't come in.  I have them an entire week and she said it would be done. I don't even live near that mall. Jeweler wanted to replace the done with a round cut when that's not even the shape of my diamond it's a princess cut. Manager was nice enough to apologize but add for his staff I wouldn't trust them. So I wouldn't recommend taking your jewelry there especially if you have to leave it and come back another day. Staff had POOR COMMUNICATION!
0,"They have a large selection with a variety of types of furnishings....BUTT, their prices were ridiculous. Nit to mention the two teams two times I have been there not one sales person offered to help me"
0,"Wow. I guess we just had a really bad service  or the chefs simply sucked that night. We ordered Miso Soup for starters and that was the end of our service because the Miso Soup was sour and disgusting. SMH! \n\nOther than that the place is very beautiful and friendly staff. They apologize, however we will not be returning. First impression of taste of the food is everything, after all I go to Culinary School."
0,"I'm not sure what the 'V' stands for, but I think it means Eddie V's off course, a little more often than not. At least that's sums up all my experiences.\n\nI've been here three times, hoping at least one them would have supported what my fellow D.C. Ranchers are always spouting-off about this place. \nI've concluded that perhaps in their drug-addled youth, they got a hold of some bad LSD, predisposing them to the belief that if something costs an assload, it must be good.\n\nA ridiculously small lunch portion of halibut forced a visit to the nearby candy store,'Sugar', where I loaded up on my childhood faves, got a sugar rush that made my heart palpitate, and got into a fight with my wife for not sharing my Charleston Chew with her.\n\nI was hungry. \nAnd Eddie V's made me hungry.\nBut he won't do it again.\nBecause I know something he doesn't.\nThrice bitten, followed by a sugaring of near fatal proportions, four times shy,"
1,"This is a great show!  The performers were amazingly talented, and it was very well choreographed.  If you are a huge Beatles fan, there are lots of subtle references to people and places.  I agree with previous reviewer to not purchase orchestra seats.  There are lots of aerial acts that are best seen from the balcony, and one act in particular I don't think you would be able to see at all from the orchestra.  All in all, well worth the money for an amazing show."
0,I have come here a few times and each time has been hit and miss between items on the menu.\nService was usually decent.\nWait was usually long in the drive-thru.\n\nTonight was the last time though.\nI only went there because I got a coupon here and there.. no more.\nThe dude was rude on the intercom totally rushing me and being annoying.\nI get up there after waiting forever and he only gives me half the discount because he swiped my card before I gave him the coupon. He didn't tell me either he just tried to sneak it. I had already told him when I ordered that I had a coupon and he could have asked a manager for help. He was still rushing me out of there even more since he knew he was being sneaky.\n\nSo my wife got the 5 piece chicken tenders... I only thought it was chicken because it was labeled as such. It smelled like straight up chemicals. It tasted the same. Like urine chemicals........\n\nI wanted to get my money back but didn't want to go in there and I was just over it. I am pissed to have wasted $6 on chemical chicken and the loss of coupon though.\n\nThen I had 10 mins to shop at SuperTarget because Carl's Jr took so long and it was almost 9pm.\n\nDone.
0,This place is as generic as it gets. I could've made a better dinner with products from Walmart.
1,Great sushi buffet! The sushi is fresh and the service is great. Nice ambience too. Love the spicy tuna salad-yum! The bacon wrapped scallop is so yummy too! All their rolls r fabulous! Would highly recommend it. This is now my regular spot whenever I'm in Vegas.
1,"Shout out to the great staff& products , best juices, super helpful& badass builds. They always know what I'll like and are just super cool...thanks again Ross and everyone else working there...this is a vape shop"
1,"Not bad for Las Vegas, Coming from the bay area, its going to be a tough review but holds its own for a mexican joint. The prices are amazing and the burrito holds its own."
0,"I have been a long term Bassett customer. A few years back I bought a mattress from them. This mattress was hardly ever slept on. Probably less than 30 times. About 3 months back we noticed that one of the springs was jutting out of the mattress. I called Bassett up to utilize the warranty. Bassett kept pushing the replacement issue on Sealy. The mattress is imprinted with Bassett's name, we bought the mattress from Bassett, so Bassett should cover it under the 5year warranty. They offered to replace the mattress with a downgraded replacement. They kept pushing that since they didn't carry my original mattress in stock any more and kept telling me they are actually doing me a favor by offering to replace the mattress( mind you ... a mattress that is still under warranty) and I should take whatever they are offering. Finally, they offered to replace the mattress with another mattress that they told me is actually an upgrade. At the time of delivery when I got the name of the mattress, I looked it up and found out that it was a significant downgrade. Not only that but they told me in no uncertain terms that they won't replace the box spring. I bought these two as a pair. Each box spring is designed to work with a specific mattress, both aesthetically and functionally. \n\nBassett, please pick up the junk you left at my house. I won't be paying the Bassett premium for their furniture if they don't stand behind their product. Time to move on."
1,"Moe's BBQ in Matthews for those who don't know 14 beer taps...from my memory they are as of yesterday and they have daily $3 specials and their ice tea is perfect too if you don't care from beer.\n\nDFH 90 minute\nFoothills Jade\nOlde Hickory Imperial Stout\nFounders Porter\nNoDa Hop, Drop 'n Roll\nNoDa Gordgeous\nBirdsong\nand a few more I can't recall.\n\nThe food is awesome!! Love the BBQ but the fried chicken on Wednesday is really good, and the shrimp \""Mo boy\"" sandwich is incredible! (had it twice this week) Their sides are all fresh homemade with some being everyday and some daily specials. All have been GREAT so far with the succotash and jalapeno cheese grits being my favorite so far! My wife got the sweat potato casserole as a dessert and it too was amazing...topped with toasted corn flakes I think the only thing it needed was a little whip cream!!! The only disappointment so far has been the banana pudding...it has no bananas.\n\nOn our first visit we sorta gripped about the serving sizes of the sides, but for $10 you get a sandwich, 2 sides, and a drink and we have not left hungry. The building is nice with roll up bay doors, screens, and 2 outdoor patios."
1,"Our Favs 2013:  Breadfruits' Grilled calamari and Beckett's Tables' deep fried Deviled Eggs.  We were happy Santa Barbara wines were featured as well as many local vinos.  Did I mention the foie gras tacos? Or Relishes smoked pulled pork tacos?, or the pork belly Reuben's on pretzel bread or Fez's cold duck salad? A great day indeed!  Oh, that carrot coconut soup and the salmon cakes and...."
0,The waitress was overwhelmed. Other servers were not. Food took forever & was luke warm. I sent the fried perch back in hopes of getting something Hot. Didn't really make a difference.
0,We ordered waited one hour pizza never came.  Called they said new guy snswered phone didnt know this location changed hours even though menu says 12m.  Dont order from here if you ever want to get your food.  Its a good chance they will take your  order and the food will never arrive.  How does the order taking call center not know the hours of all locations.
0,"The pho was kind of overpriced in my opinion. Considering it is Montreal, I shouldn't be that surprised but I had pretty high expectations for pho. I ordered a spring roll, and it literally was just one spring roll and it cost me 3 dollars. Most expensive spring roll I've ever had, and it wasn't even that great."
1,"The food and service are good just that a couple of weeks ago during that freak cold spell, the one waitress kept leaving the door open to the outside patio-----------brrrr! \n\nThough I'd definitely go back there to eat."
1,"For my first trip to Las Vegas, my boyfriend and I decided to stay at the Bellagio. I had read really great reviews, and really bad reviews, so I didn't really know what to expect.\n\nI loved staying here. Check in was fast; our room was ready at 11am. We had a partial lakeview on the 25th floor in the spa tower that had a great view of pretty much the whole fountain show and the strip. The room was updated, except for the tv, but I wasn't there to watch tv anyways. The bathroom was nice-stone counters and floors, seperate soaking tub and shower. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Loved the motorized blackout drapes; if only I could install them in our apartment.\n\nThe service was really great. Every employee we encountered asked if we needed something, especially room service. I enjoyed the casino a lot as well, it had a nice variety of slots and table games. \n\nSomething we  were disappointed in was the selection of late night eating. They have the Cafe Bellagio, but it is sit down and at 3am you just want quick eats. Thank god for the 24 newstand shop and its selection of chips and candy...ok and selection of alcohol too.\n\nWe will definitely stay here again in the future."
1,"I seriously love this place! I'm now becoming one of the regulars who stop by every Tuesday night for the great comedy show that is put on. Some  nights the comedy is a little iffy, but most of the time I am LOL'ing. \n\nI tried the tacos for the 1st time last week and for $1.50 they are some of the best tacos I've ever had! After awhile everyone starts to know you by name, and remembers your drink orders (even if service gets a little slow). The perfect little dive bar for me. =D \n\nI've been searching for a bar like this for sometime and I coudln't be happier that it's right down the road from me.\n\nThe impression everyone gave me was that this was some kind of biker bar, but after you visit you'll find there is a HUGE mixture of people who frequent here. So don't listen to everything you hear, you should really experience this place.\n\nIf you are on the border of checking this place out, just do it! (Esp. if it's a Tuesday!!!)"
1,"My husband & I ate here last night during our trip to Pittsburgh.  I had read online about their cheap happy hour.  We did get here an hour early but decided to sit at the bar and order anyway.  It wasn't busy at 4:00 on a Monday (but then it was rainy and windy outside).  Our bartender/server, Jorge, was just wonderful.  He was very personable and recommended items to us both.  I was going to order the fish tacos with tilapia but he said the mahi mahi tacos were better.  Indeed they were.  The homemade chips and queso were also a great starter.  They have great beer on tap and an extensive liquor selection.\n\n The restaurant is on the second floor and you can look out the windows at Market Square.  We will definitely come back on a return visit!  Another bartender recommended a breakfast place to us and we are on our way there this morning."
1,"First I should disclose that cycling is my great addiction! When traveling without my own bike, I always fit a ride or two into my itinerary using rental bikes. \nI rented a bike from Outback Adventures while in Scottsdale, Arizona last week. When considering the rates, quality of equipment, ease of rental, general policies, and customer relations...I've got to rate this shop the best I have ever encountered! \nI return to Scottsdale every year for Spring Training. I'm so glad that I discovered this place...planning on many future rentals."
1,"I have been a P.F. Chang fan since I lived in Texas many moons ago.  This one is no exception.  Complimentary valet will win me over time and time again and its location is wonderful if you want to walk across the street and walk that meal off!  Or...sit on a nice bench.  Haha.\n\nEvery single time I have been to this location the service has been nothing less of stellar.  I order water a lot when I go out (I don't really do soda) and automatically get stereotyped as \""poor college student that won't tip\"" (which, by the way, is untrue) so I get the cold shoulder service.  Not so, even in a place like this.  It's not Morton's but it's still upscale in comparison to Chili's and even Carrabbas.\n\nWhat to order: Chicken lettuce wraps, Kung Pao chicken (ask the server for extra spicy...if you can handle it!), P.F. Chang's fried rice with chicken (add cashews), and their diet-melting-but-to-die-for dessert spring rolls.  Yum yum yum!  Great atmosphere to de-stress, get a martini, and munch on some awesome food."
1,I enjoyed a 3 course brunch at Mimosa. We had a good discussion with our waiter about the area and the meal. Nice ambiance and food was top notch. I look forward to trying lunch/dinner in the future.
1,The best comfort food you could ever want.  Daily specials are excellent.  Nothing fancy but clean and well organized. Very reasonably priced.
1,"I actually found this place.. through a menu left on my door. Usually I throw those away on the spot.. but I do have an interest in different Asian Style foods. So i gave it a try. I was very please with what I ordered the first time.. which was duck wraps and curry noodles. I didn't know what to get so I went with what I like and I was pleased. Since then I have ordered from this place a couple more times. I have tried a few different dishes.. the delivery of the food is always hot and comes in about 30 minutes for me.. \n\nUpon reading other reviews I will be ordering again and trying the recommended dishes. Give it a shot. Its good stuff. \n\nP.S. I was a bit more than slightly impressed with the fact that they remembered that I am one of only 2 people in my housing area that orders from them.. it was nice for the recognition. The young lady that answers teh phone is very cordial and helpful. I'm just saying.. it's nice to get good service, even on a take-out order!"
0,"Big Trouble in Little Szechuan would be too harsh a review  and  it's not worthy  of a great wail but  I was totally underwhelmed by the food on offer and food wise it seriously is   a step above the mall food court  but   even a Pei Way on a good day  is more than a match for this evening's meal. \n\nStaff are great but  everything else is pretty weak other than the noodles which are really really good.     The spring roll, egg, hot  and sour soup and  the  kung pao all look the part but  it's all monotonous  with little variation in texture and taste.  E.g you could  make this from  Walmart  ingredients and get the same kinda shiny sauce for about the same cost     It's not going to kill you and for lunch at a reduced rate may get to 2.5 to 3 but  there's just way too many good places nearby to consider this as a repeat visit."
1,"Super friendly service, food made to order lightning quick, and highly competitive prices.  While the food may be modified for the local taste, it is nonetheless a great value and each container can feed 2 people.  There are days when you just don't want to cook and GY should be on your rolodex of take-away/delivery restaurants.  Living in the neighborhood, I've often passed by this tiny little store, which has a 'waiting room' no bigger than a breadbox.  Usually, at dinnertime, it's got 3 or 4 people waiting for their orders...that's why I ventured in and tried them.  I think with their service, especially, and pricing, I'll be back."
1,"Awesome sandwiches!  The meatball is as good as it gets.  They have kids meals and a clean place to eat with the family.  Fast, good,  affordable.  What more could you want?"
0,"I can tolerate bad food when there's great service, and I'll deal with awful service when there's amazing food.  But at Il Mulino, we paid $100/person for above-average food and below-average service.  You can do better in LV.\n\nFOOD: Il Mulino starts you off with some tasty complimentary appetizers.  The parmesan cheese was great.  The bruschetta was decent, but I've had better.  The mussels were not fresh, but they're free.\n\nNone of the main courses wowed me, and at the price, they definitely should have.  The osso bucco ($48) was tender but bland, and came with a saffron risotto that was dry and gloppy, not creamy and luxurious the way it should be.  The lobster ravioli ($40ish) was overly cheesy and tasted nothing like lobster.  The veal chop (not sure) was totally dry and tasteless, like an overcooked pork chop.  The capellini with truffles and pancetta ($30) was the best main course, but I couldn't taste any truffle at all, so there was nothing too special about it.\n\nSERVICE: Started great, ended pretty badly.  From the minute you sit down, servers swarm you and start throwing free food at you.  Awesome.  But our actual waiter was snide and inattentive.  When my mother asked him to repeat some of the specials, he scoffed, \""Really? Do I really have to do that again?\""  He forgot to bring out one of our dishes, which would have been forgivable had we been able to find him to tell him.  Instead, after taking our order, he disappeared for the rest of the meal.  We ended up grabbing a bus boy to get us our spinach.  Glasses went unfilled, plates uncollected.  I've had better service at Olive Garden."
0,"We were unfortunate enough to order at this Wendy's during late night hours, specifically around midnight. There was a shortage of food, as they had to give us two smaller salads when they ran out of regular sized, we had to substitute fried chicken, which is indistinguishable from the spicy fried chicken, for grilled chicken, and they forgot some of our drinks. The ones they did remember were incorrect, i.e. sweet instead of unsweet. Finally, the service was rushed and not passionate, and they did not give us a receipt. This was particularly important as we had a large group of orders which needed to be split."
0,Very bad service !!! Food was good but u wait a long time for ur food.... The only thing the servers can do so quick is when they give you ur check....not very nice is like there doing it in purpose....i dnt ussually do this review but we were there 3x & still same .....
0,"Wow yelp...really should get that \""zero star\"" set out for this place!  AWFUL, HORRIBLE, YUCK, and pitiful customer service.  \n\nMy husband and I are new to Arizona and I had bought a groupon for this place in hopes to find us a new favorite spot to go in our new hometown.  I was at first pleasantly surprised by our waitress who seemed nice and knowledgeable.  She took our drink order and gave us some time to get a feel for the menu.  We also ordered an appetizer of onion rings.  Onion rings were ok, drinks had no detectable alcohol in them, which is strange for rum and coke, haven't ever had that issue before.  I asked her to take away and off of my bill.  She did.  She told us that a great \""share\"" dinner would be one of their combo platters.  So we ordered the platter with beef brisket, beef ribs, and a quarter piece of chicken which also came with a side of steak fries and mac n cheese.  We waited, and waited, and waited some more.  About 30 or so minutes later she arrives.  We expected a PLATTER, especially for the $22 price tag.  What we got was a regular 9 inch dinner plate with a bowl of about 1/2 cup of mac n cheese on it along with the meats and fries.  We both looked for another plate thinking, \""This can't possibly be it\"".  It was.  I think that it sat under a heat lamp for 20 of those minutes we had waited, and maybe on the counter for another 10.  Everything was dry and the BBQ sauce, OMG, awful.  And the food was cold.  Our waitress was gone for a long time, long enough for the bus boy to come around, seeing that we were just sitting there, and ask if he could take our plate which still had the food on it.  Once our waitress did surface, I told her that everything was dry and not good at all.  She said, \""Oh sorry\"".  She did ask if she could bring us anything else, but disappointment after disappointment, we declined.  The final bill was under what the groupon had allotted, so we left it and went to go to car to leave.  She comes running out after saying that she needed more money.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  I don't even think we should have to pay for something so awful and here you come asking for more money?  She said that the groupon didn't cover the few bucks in tax.  I was amazed.  Save some face Dillon's...that is ridiculous.  I have never been to a restaurant that didn't comp food that was not to a customer's liking.  Especially when it was this bad.  Again, should have checked the reviews here on yelp...when will I learn that lesson (lol)?  I think it has sunk in now!  \n\nLet me add in that I am a little picky when it comes to food, however, my husband is not.  He will NOT waste food...but wouldn't eat this...THAT is a true testament to how bad it was.  I have never seen him waste food in the 8 years I have known him."
0,"I've been to Sam Woo in NYC, Toronto, LA and Orange County.  This one in Vegas is by far the worst.  The bbq meats and the meals are a significant notch below the others  I've had bbq pork which was really dry, and I was surprised they served it.  The best bbq offering is the stewed pork stomach.  At the other Sam Woo's, my favorite dish to order is the salted fish and chicken fried rice.  However in this location, there didn't seem to have any salted fish flavor.  The beef chow fun is lacking in beef.  And to top it off, the place is not as clean as the others.  I've gone here around 7-8 times, hoping that things would be improved, but I have moved on to other chinese restaurants as there are simply too many other options in Chinatown."
0,Worst service ever.  Waited at table for 15 min no service the went to bar and took order 90 people running around but no one carries
1,"I've been searching for a regular massage therapist for some time to no avail; someone who I could trust and feel completely comfortable with, that I could connect with and know that they had my best interest at heart. After disappointment after disappointment, I was referred to Millie through a relative with assurances that I would be happy and let me tell you that was a complete and utter understatement. Millie is one of the best therapists I have ever had the pleasure of being on their table, and I can say wholeheartedly that if you need work done she's your therapist. \nHer office is in an upscale, clean medical building in a very comfortable atmosphere and is very easy to find. Millie was waiting for us in the hallway and immediately started waving when she saw us, not even knowing if we were her clients, which put me right at ease. She is an extremely kind and soft spoken lady which added to my comfort. The office is shared with other therapists but is not cramped at all and is very nicely decorated with music playing throughout the whole office. \nMillie is very skilled at many different modalities along with energy work and used several during my appointment, which I have never experienced, even at the most expensive spas. The products that she used felt and smelled top notch. The only drawback, if you could call it that, is her table is a standard massage table, a more luxurious one would have added to the experience but is comfortable none the less. \nIf you're looking for a therapist for the long term, one that you can trust and to have your wellbeing in mind at all times this is your person. I can't say enough about her, she's just stellar. A little background about me and my recommendation: while I am no longer in the industry, I am a certified massage therapist and know what makes or breaks an awesome massage/therapy session. I have enjoyed massages from all over the world, in some of the most upscale spas and from some of the most in demand therapists and I can now say I found and recommend one here in Las Vegas, Millie V."
1,"Excellent!  I had a Boba drink, tried seaweed and had a soup with mock duck.  Delicious.  I think I'm leaning towards being a vegetarian.  However, that would mean no more carne asada from ghetto roach coaches."
0,"My husband and I went to Vegas for his 30th birthday and decided to treat ourselves to a fancy dinner. What better place for that than the Eiffel Tower? We made a reservation around sunset thinking it would be extra romantic. We got there on time (5:15pm) and were seated shortly thereafter. Our server was nice but not super friendly but the hostess was very rude and, for a lack of better words, snobby. We were given a window seat which we were happy with but the tables are small and extremely close together so your elbows bump with your neighbor when using utensils which is silly considering that we are both fairly small people. We both ordered a steak; I the New York and my husband the filet, both $59 a piece. I ordered mine medium which arrived VERY well done and my husband ordered his medium-rare which came out medium-well. Only one side of each steak was seasoned and both contained far too much fat for the cuts. The entrees do not include any sides so we shared an order of potatoes Gratin which had no flavor and the consistency if mayonnaise. There was zero opportunity to express our disappointment with our meal since our waiter seemed to disappear after the food was delivered to the table. All in all, the meal wasn't terrible but it was far from what I would have expected from one of the nicest restaurants in the area."
1,"This place is amazing and I have never had a bad experience here. It's clean, fast, and most importantly the food is great. Tyler (the owner) is always attentive and nice to chat with. I highly recommend this place, call your order in advance as they get busy."
1,"Very tasty food! I've grown up in Southern Ca and consider myself a pretty good judge of good Mexican food, but I did not expect to find it at a hotel in Vegas! The taquitos and relleno are scrump.  Recommend giving it a try!"
0,Stayed from 3/19/2014-3/23/2014\nThis hotel doesn't even rate a star; in fact it should get negative stars.  My bathtub hadn't been cleaned in my room and was full of hair and soap scum.  I moved rooms and in that one the garbage hadn't been emptied and the sink in the kitchen spewed water all over due to a leak.  My friends' room had toilet issues and the tank leaked twice all over the floor.  When we checked in everyone was complaining that the hot water wasn't working and the maintenance guy worked all night to get it back.  It's very expensive for what you get which is a hotel that is so run down that everything is broken; you can't be sure your room is clean and people complained of noise when some revelers came in at 2:30 in the morning.  I would be better off sleeping in the car.  At least it was cheaper!
0,Horrible! Don't go to this place... with the new owners they probably changed chefs as well. They suck big time! Mochi was ice frozen... when we complained about the quality of sushi & how hard the Mochi was they didn't care. Horrible! Stay away from this sushi joint!
1,I ordered to go here upon the request of the ladies I work with. I was surprised that the sushi was pretty good. Not a bad price for good sushi. I would rather go here than the rotating sushi place down the street. I also ordered tempura udon. It was pretty good for takeout. I would go back.  I like that they have other options too so I can take my husband who doesn't like sushi. :)
1,"Fast food Chinese is generally not that exciting, but I must say this place really was quite impressive. Very fresh tasting ingredients with a lot of good flavors, all served hot and with a smile. What more could you ask for?"
0,"First, I have used Enterprise Rent-A-Car many times and perhaps this is just the service at this specific location...but it was an awful experience.\n\nIt started with having to contact this Enterprise office multiple times to have them pick me up from a body repair shop where my vehicle was being repaired. \n\nOnce I was picked up and taken to this office, it took nearly half an hour before I was processed to pick up a vehicle that had been reserved for me by an insurance carrier.  They informed me I had been approved for a full size car, but they were going to upgrade me to an SUV.\n\nWhen they took outside to inspect my vehicle, I was shocked to see this Dodge Journey pull up.  The outside has as filthy as the inside. The agent said it must have gotten a little rain on it...or more like it was following a muddy tractor-trailer rig in a storm.  Pure dirt.\n\nBecause it was already so late and I did not want to return to the room full of other customers all waiting for a rental, I drove the vehicle off their lot to work.  The inside was disgustingly dirty with stains on the doors, on the cloth seats and it smelled like a wet cat and cigarettes. Ugh!\n\nThe transmission sounded like it was going to fall apart as a raw, grinding sound was audible when driving.  When it was idle, it reminded me of an older diesel engine.\n\nIf I had to personally pay for this rental, I would have chosen another vehicle rental company.\n\nWhat a disappointment."
1,Great food... Great service... There is a very comfortable cozy atmosphere. The prices are reasonable and you get a good amount of food. This was my first time and I highly recommend!
1,Lots of fun; totally worth 25 bucks! I totally drank my monies worth and enjoyed the the scenery and break from Vegas!
0,No ......we never received a quote or even a call back for that matter even after we had left several messages. If they would have gotten back to us like they said then we would have paid the down payment or decided to go elsewhere like we eventually did and never would have written such a negative review. We can not speak  for any one else but in our situation this company was extremely flaky. That's why they get 1 star.
0,"My food hasn't come yet but service and water sucks ass. My water has pink shit in it and our forks look dirty. I don't care how good the food is, it cannot bump up the rating due to bad service.\n\nUpdate: The food came before I got to post this and it was bad. The bread for our sandwich was old and the pizza was dry, plain and hard-ish. \n\nI originally wrote this 4 days ago but forgot to post this. oops. Still one star. Oh yeah, did we mention that we received plastic cups instead of glass cups like everyone else? Are you afraid that 2 wild youngin's are going to break your beautiful 50 cent glass cups? (we're 21 but we do look damn young!) The water was so nasty that I ordered sprite, where my first one had sea monkeys in it! They gave me a 2nd sprite without me asking, and it didn't have sea monkeys in it so I was like WOW cool."
0,this place has been Charlotted. that means a place was once cool and now the soul has been sucked out of it.
0,I don't know why this place has 4 stars. The beer and pretzels were delicious. The fish fry was over cooked and blah. My salad was wilted. It's easy to find good beer. I can live without the pretzels. I won't be back.
0,"It's just unfortunate that they are next to a fantastic french restaurant. It just does not compare and the croissants are OK. I mean i couldn't make them on my own.. but i will not be returning. There was nothing in here that calls to you and being the only ones getting helped and buying croissants there, it took a very long while to check out.\n\nNot even service could save them...."
0,"We went there for lunch, figured it would be nice to eat in one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, even if it's a cheaper one (well, not really, let's say cheap for Vegas...). So, right off the bat, looking at the menu, I knew there was no way I was going to pay 27$ for fish and chips. Maybe they're really good, but like most things in Vegas I'm sure they're not worth the price. And the same can be said for most of the menu, like 22$ for bangers and mash or for a chicken pot pie. I don't think so. \n\nSo we went for less expensive items: Deviled eggs, Mac & cheese and Duck confit poutine. The deviled eggs (2) we're tasty, but not worth the 8$. They were my idea; my girlfriend didn't see anything special about them. She enjoyed her mac & cheese but it was too salty. Now the duck confit poutine, oh boy... First off, my poutine had very little of everything, very little duck, very little cheese, and very little sauce in the little cup on the side. So, it's mostly just 12$ for fries with a bit of toppings on them. The fries themselves? Not even very good, a good fry you can taste the potato still, not these. They didn't even seem homemade. \n\nMr. Ramsay, if you're going to serve poutine in one of your restaurants, I'd suggest coming here, to Qu\u00e9bec City, and seeing what real poutine is. I can take you to a few dozen places, easily, that serve better poutine, and I'm talking anything from little shacks on the side of the road serving the traditionnal kind, to french bistros with a delicious twist on this classic. In fact, I could take you about an hour and a half outside QC city, to a small roadside restaurant where a culinary trained couple is doing lobster poutine, bison burgers, and more, oh and the best duck confit poutine anywhere. Tons of really good duck, tons of very fresh cheese curds, an amazing sauce and some of the best fries you'll ever eat. And it's definitely less than 12$US. Of course, for us the drive there ends up raising the price of that poutine somewhat, still worth every penny though. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. I sincerely doubt you can get your money's worth for anything there."
0,"I would NOT recommend this place at all!! I tired the Al pastor and asada sopes. \n\nThe asada was pale looking, no color and dry. I spit out half the meat because it was fat I was chewing on.\n\nThe Al pastor was mushy and overly seasoned.\n\nThe sopes portion was burnt and had chunks of corn it in which made it taste sweet.. not a fan at all.\n\nThe toppings on the sopes consisted of the fake prepackaged shredded cheese. Tasted like I had watered down American sour cream. The beans did not taste fresh and out of a rosarita can. \n\nTo drink I had the horchata.. tasted watered down and not homemade. Def came from a package.\n\nThis place was worse than Robertos. And if you've ate there you know it is just as far from authentic as taco bell."
0,This place is ridiculously understaffed. We had to take our food to go and we live 45 minutes away. Cool atmosphere but wouldn't recommend it based on service.
0,This place sucks! Had to tell them to vacuum my car again when I said why my inside looked so opaque customer survive guy said obviously the services are rushed were busy. Paid for the VIP. Waste of money. My car doesn't smell so I didn't get my air freshmen and my inside was def not dressed. And to top it off they parked my car underneath a tree with pollen falling. Fail!!!!
1,"Enjoy a simple breakfast with good service? this is your place. \n\nThis place has good service, good food and prices are fair. The bakery is full of wonderful delights and with up coming holidays, you might want to put in your special order, like strawberry rhubard pie!\n\nToday I had three scrabbled, bacon with country potatos and a rasian bagel with plain cream cheese. It' s plain. Simple and always works for me! \n\nThey have a full menu and their sandwiches are excellent! Always a real treat to dine in here."
0,"This place is HORRIBLE!!! Checked in and tried to check out immediately, but ended up stuck in this rat trap for 2 whole days. The casino and ground floor are newly remodeled which makes you think you're gonna have an enjoyable stay. Once you get upstairs it's an entirely different story. The walls and carpet are stained with who knows what throughout the entire place. When you enter the rooms, OMG, the place is saturated in cigarette smoke (even though it's supposed to be a no smoking room) and in an attempt to air the place out the \""secured\"" door to the balcony was wide open! The bathroom wasn't any better and I don't have enought time or words to describe how horrendous it was. I'll just leave you with one example, there was hair stuck to the walls of a supposedly \""cleaned\"" shower (yuck!!!)!!! As if this wasn't bad enough, when I was finally making my escape from this rat trap this morning I wasn't even able to take the elevator down. I had to walk down 11 flights of stairs (that's right 11!) with luggage! Needless to say, I will never ever visit this motel (I refuse to dignify it in any way by calling it a hotel) ever again! In all my years and trips to Las Vegas my stay at The Quad has managed to make #1 on my list of absolute worsts!!! Note to parents: if you have small children please don't stay here. I'm sure the medical bills for your babies will costs far more than you save by staying in this death trap! Unfortunately, I can't even give this place 0 stars because Yelp won't let me. I'll give em 1 star since they did have electricity and indoor toilets."
0,"Long wait for substandard overpriced food.  Saved a lunch just to try them out, particularly their lobster roll.  The lobster roll is served on a buttered brioche bread, not a roll, which just doesn't taste right and is horrible.  The lobster meat is chopped into tiny pieces with copious amounts of mayonnaise and celery, to the point that there is no lobster flavor and definitely no texture.  The bread is coated with butter and pan fried which produces an oily, sloppy mess.  It's a failure sandwich of disappointment.\n\nAlso tried the lobster chowder in the bread bowl, which was ok but way overpriced for the little amount you get.  My friend ordered the shrimp po boy, which was bad as well.  The shrimp was battered and deep fried then served on a hot dog roll and not good at all.  Why they refused to serve the lobster salad on the bread roll I'll never know (we did ask, the chef refused).  \n\nThe sandwiches come with fries or coleslaw and you can \""combo\"" it for $6 which means add a drink. WTH?  If it comes with fries anyway aren't you just paying $6 for a drink then?  Better strategy would be to go to another spot and order a drink separately since they all come from the same coke fountain anyway.  I ordered a coleslaw because my friend went with fries and got fries anyway.  After the 20 min wait for the food I didn't want to go back and exchange.\n\nBottom line: walk across the street to Planet Hollywood's LobsterMe instead for good lobster roll."
1,"What a great find in Charlotte! Mert's Heart and Soul is just that- a little bit of food love in the city. \n\nWe went for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. As we pushed open the door- we were greeted by Robin who quickly seated us, took note of my lack of accent and asked where I was from, and got us going with some great cornbread and butter as we sipped our beers and looked over the menu. \n\nBreakfast? Lunch? Breakfast? Lunch? Well breakfast won out but only by a fraction of a point as the southern fried chicken and mashed potatoes and green beans were definitely calling to me. \n\nBut I went with the omelet with ham and cheese and a side of buttermilk pancakes. My dining companion went with the eggs and country ham (ooh- that is some salty ham!) Both were served with a side of home fries. The food was great. But the service was even better. \n\nRobin took great care of us, making sure we had everything we needed and told me I just \""had to try\"" the cornbread so she brought that out as well. Loved the music- Sam Cooke, and Sam and Dave played through our entire breakfast adding to the ambiance. \n\nThis is not a fancy place. But one that serves up good food, with friendly service and reasonable prices. Breakfast for two with drinks ran about $34. Definitely on my list to go back to the next time I'm in Charlotte."
0,Rave motion pictures and Regal theaters are better. Why would you have $5 Movie Mondays but for only select movies and not all movies. LAME!
1,"I went here by my lonesome self on a Wednesday night, it was quite busy but there was no line.\n\nThe interior is really nice, they have murals of Mexican theme on their walls, and the ceiling is like one of those Vegas hotels. Noise level is not so bad either, it's a good place to take a date.\n\nI had better Mexican food that is much cheaper too, but  we have to remember we're paying for ambiance too. I got the rib eye steak with enchiladas and a margarita, there's nothing special about their steak either, ordinary steak that you also get at Denny's. I love their tortilla chips with 4 kinds salsa, the chips are thin and crispy that goes well with the salsas, you just can't stop eating.\n\nLastly I give their service five stars, my server who's name is Madison is really friendly and attentive but not intrusive, my drink took a little longer to come (which I don't know why since the bar is not that busy) but I didn't mind at all because of her positive attitude. She even gave me extra salsa and chips to go when I told her I really like the chips."
1,"Fast service (walk-in).\nLots of selection, even after the morning rush hours. \nPrice is a little higher than the grocery bakerys, but the product is great."
1,"True Japanese food! Very fresh fish and authentic preparation. Will definitely do well, I know I'll be back!"
0,"I was in las vegas for vacation, and wanna to try dim sum. I read those review and decide to give it a try . Wow it has been worst then I though. All i can taste is MSG. SUPER DISAPPOINTED. I dont understand how it was rated that high. Even the tea is awkful. Maybe thoae reviewer before has never try read sim sum or just get to use to american style dim sum."
0,"Did I eat at the correct Akaihana? Because based off the reviews, it seems like I had a completely different experience here that was hardly passable in my book.\n\nAkaihana advertised a happy hour and had deals for apps, sushi rolls and alcohol, plus it was cheap, but I guess some things are too good to be true. I stepped into Akaihana and was greeted by the sushi chef in some kind of indistinct Asian language, I'm used to the \""Irasshaimase\"" greeting as I used to serve at a Japanese restaurant in the past. However, I could not make out what language he was speaking. Regardless, I was seated in the corner of the restaurant and was given 3 menus.\n\nSince I was sharing dinner, the items that were ordered were: Tootsie Roll, Spicy Salmon Roll, Tropicana Roll\n\n-Tootsie Roll: deep fried salmon surrounding imitation crab meat, big roll and served with a soy-based sauce\n-Spicy Salmon Roll: chopped up salmon mixed with spicy sauce in a roll, this is nothing special. Spicy salmon does not work in my book, spicy tuna does though. \n- Tropicana Roll: Salmon with mango, each piece topped with spicy mayo and sriracha and more soy-based sauce\n\nThis place masks the quality of their fish with sauces, deep frying and rice portion. The portion of rice was overwhelming in comparison to the rest of the fish in the rolls and wasn't seasoned well and hard, the sauces overtake your tastebuds not allowing you to taste the fish. The ginger was very sweet and I didn't even dare try the wasabi.\n\nCheap prices are reflected in their quality of rolls,: over sauced, too much rice and lacking in quality of fish. Interior is a bit crazy with variety of menu choices and service is decent at most. Also upon leaving, the sushi chef greeted me once again in some indistinct (made up sounding) language which I found to be a bit offensive. Because I know for a fact he was not speaking Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese or Filipino because I've worked and frequent Japanese and Korean restaurants/have friends who are and that I am both Vietnamese and Filipino.\n\n*Pass on this place, I got a stomach ache the whole night after dining in here."
0,"No care to detail, including when we walked in the door. \""Do you have a reservation?\"" No, not at 5:30 pm and how about Hello?  There were plenty of tables open. The server could have at least worn a less worn T-shirt with jeans. It's sloppy.\nPot roast veggies could have used more flavor along with the aioli served with the fries.  It doesn't appear that the fry oil had been changed in a while.  You can tell by the way it tastes and the color.  I noticed all the fried items were coming out the same dark brown, including the donuts.  \nAt these prices, there is better in Scottsdale and Phoenix."

1,I had the pleasure of singing with the Las Vegas Philharmonic in Reynolds Hall. But I prefer the Cabaret Jazz venue-sit upstairs though.
0,"Worst service of any Chilis restaurant.  I've been here multiple times and had near perfect results in being seated and then ignored for a good 10 minutes or so.  On the last occasion, it turns out the server was seated with a patron just a few rows over, having a casual conversation.  Amazing.\n\nMenu is limited compared to a regular Chilis, and prices are about the same.  Beer selection is just average, and prices are average with respect to the rest of the airport merchants."
1,"My boyfriend and I had dinner at Yard House.  I ordered Searred Ahi dinner for the first time and it was excellent!  I loved it!  When we do come here on previous occasions, I've always ordered the appetizers. I'm glad I tried something new."
1,AWESOME DEAL !!!!\n\nI got this this past weekend and it was worth every penny.\n\nGot to eat about 4 buffets and it was great.
1,"I had the pleasure of tasting a couple of their pastries offered at Leone Cafe in Tivoli Village, so I knew that I had to make my way over to the actual bakery eventually. For my birthday, I wanted something different from my usual trip to Freed's Bakery and realized that instead of being constrained to cake, I could indulge in one of my favorite desserts: Tiramisu! I've had good (and bad) tiramisu at various restaurants, but I had to do a little research for an establishment offering a complete dessert rather than single servings. I discovered that Patisserie Manon offered a tiramisu cake via search, so it was decided!\n\nI called to ensure that there were whole cakes available on Tuesday evening. Not only did they have the tiramisu cakes available, there are different sizes! That day, there were three (3) sizes available, noted in terms of how many people it serves: 4, 5, or 6. Prices start at $24 and increase in $6 increments to $36 for the largest. I opted for the \""6-person\"" cake for $36 and requested a 'Happy Birthday' greeting. The individual assisting me via phone was very helpful and assured me about reserving the cake and having a chocolate birthday piece to place on top of the cake. Fabulous!\n\nI arrived at the bakery approximately 10 minutes later and they were very busy (it was around 5pm)! We had to wait in line with everyone else for the pick-up, but that gave me a chance to check out all the other delectable pastries, cakes, and cookies. The tiramisu cake is beautiful with large dollops of fresh whipped cream and a pile of broken chocolate pieces in the center. I love the dainty 'Happy Birthday' chocolate piece they included!\n\nThe \""6-person\"" cake can easily serve 8 big slices and even stretch to 10 smaller ones! I cut the cake to create eight slices and they were still HUGE! I can't imagine anyone eating a slice if it were cut into just six! I still have almost half the cake left. I could have probably gotten away with the \""4-person\"" cake and not have leftovers. Either way, it was very delicious! I'm not a big chocolate fan, but I found myself munching and really enjoying the chocolate pieces (it's a bit excessive; definitely for decoration purposes).\n\nP.S. Their Fraisier cake is soo good!"
0,"I have had numerous bad experiences at this Verizon Wireless store. I have been lied to by several employees about what I am being sold and will NEVER return here.   \n\nTwo prime examples:  \n\n1) I was told that since I had a tablet and phone on the same account, I could add a home line and my bill could be \""bundled and reduced by about $20-30 a month\"" so it was \""silly not to do this deal\"". Well, I took the bait and ended up with an extra line I didn't need and actually INCREASED my bill by $20-30 a month instead of reduced it, like I was told. I tried to cancel after the first month and my bill was ridiculous however it was outside of the 14 day return policy and I had to pay an extra $150 to do so!!   \n\nWell, silly silly me decided to go back since I needed a new phone and they are the closet store to me....... bad idea!!   \n\n2) I just purchased a new phone 13 days ago from this store and they refuse to return in even though the phone clearly has internal issues and registers touches all over the screen at random given moments - making emailing business clients impossible since it sometimes sends messages or types things I didn't ask it to do. I found out today, which I was NOT told initially, that I also no longer have a warranty on this phone since it was purchased on a different line and switched to the one I primarily use (since I needed an upgrade and didn't have one).   \n\nMind you, I had to purchase a new phone because someone screwed up at the store and didn't put the insurance on my phone when I asked for it multiple times (I'm adamant about this because I have terrible luck with phones). If I had had insurance, I could have gotten my phone replaced. Since I didn't, I had to get this new phone that is also messed up. Which they will not return, even though they said I had 14 days for exchanges, per their policy.  \n\n I highly recommend anyone to STAY AWAY FROM VERIZON, ESPECIALLY THIS ONE!! THEY ARE LYING THIEVES!!"
0,"It was ok, we will mostly likely not go again. \n\nWe placed an order for take out. Pork Foo Young and Sesame Chicken. The egg in the foo young was very dry and the sauce was kinda of tasteless. The Sesame Chicken was the usual fried chicken in honey sauce, it was ok. The rice was moist and hot."
0,"Bottomless Sunday brunch was just ok. The food was typical bulk standard and most dishes were lukewarm. We were with a large party, so a hefty gratuity was already included despite the subpar service.  The Bloody Mary was below average, so I would skip the bottomless option. Overall, the brunch buffet was way overpriced for simple, average food quality and mediocre service. Two stars because it is 'good for large groups'."
1,"Hands down the best value and not-so-well-kept secret in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. A friend who'd been here before introduced the rest of us to it and we loved it! After getting some expensive munchies at China Poblano we were ready to fill the rest of our stomachs for a lot less, and Secret Pizza delivered. You go down an unmarked hallway on the 2nd floor and it leads to a teeny little hole-in-wall pizza joint like ones you find on virtually every street corner in NY. The guys keep the huge pies coming, which you get by the slice. A slice will run you about $5, depending on toppings and with a draft of PBR it's almost $10 but that's really a bargain in these parts. 'Sides, the pizza is legitimately good. Big and floppy but with a crunch to the crust, it really made me feel nostalgic for the NY slices I used to get. There was a bit of a rush when we got there but the turnover's pretty fast so you should be able to squeeze into some counter space, unless you get there late night, when the real rush is on, with everyone wanting to get some grub on after clubbing or whatever. I did end up coming here again after such a late-night venture and it tasted even better, naturally. If you find yourself in the Cosmo, your visit isn't complete without a slice from Secret Pizza."
0,"Stopped into this mid-sized place for the lunch buffet today.  It's a little glitzy inside but ok, & has all glass covered tables that were mostly set up for at least four people.  I missed seeing booths, my preference, but did manage to find just one comfortable spot in the place, at a smaller, out-of-the-way table.  It's a good thing I got there at opening time!\n\nAmong the salad items, the cole slaw was tasty, & the server lady brought me naan bread that didn't have garlic or greens on it, but it was buttery, piping hot, & cooked just right.  Otherwise there was nothing special about the place.  Everything tasted ok, but a lot of the dishes were way too soupy.\n\n$8.95, Open 11:30 AM, Full Bar."
1,"Like they say, all good things must come to an end. Like all theaters now, this one has followed suite and raised prices. They used to have the best prices for movies with all shows before 6pm just $5 and after 6pm was just $7.50 with the exception of 3D movies of course.\nNow the first showing only is $5, the next one is $7.50 and night time prices kick in at 4pm and go to $10. The first showing for a 3D movie is $8.50, which is still a bargain compared to other theaters, which charge $11 for matinee 3D movies.\nSince my wife and I always go to the matinees anyway, the higher pricing has not affected us other than we may have to go a little earlier than we used to.\nSince this is the only theater close to our house that still has a $5 matinee, the other one close to us (Birkdale Regal 16) charges $7.50, its still our theater of choice."
1,"Great sandwiches, great salads and a great place for lunch. I don't get the 'midwest' references made by another reviewer. I'm a Californian and tend to not like things that are 'too much'. I think the parent restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory, does tend towards too much -- but the Grand Lux is just right."
1,"I love this place! I have been using Mystic for years and this is the kind of tanning salon I like supporting. I moved to the north side almost one year ago and had been a client, a very unhappy client, at the salon down the street. Thank God I found Tangible.

0,"We were very excited to visit the new Snooze in Phoenix with our relatives from Denver.  We arrived on a Sunday morning, at 10 am, and were told that the wait time was 60 to 75 minutes.  TWO HOURS LATER, after checking with the hostess three times after 90 minutes, we were told that we were the next table and that there were only 3 names ahead of us.  I didn't have the heart to ask WHAT that meant!  Obviously, by the time that we were seated, we had decided which items each of us would order.  Between the 8 of us, we each ordered something different to try and get a good cross section of the offerings.  Ok, lets start with the positive.  Our server was excellent.  Ummmmmmmmm, I didn't try the bacon, but it looked fine.  Our booth was comfortable.  Silverware was clean.  Now, the rest of the story.  One would think that with a two hour wait the food should be pretty darn impressive.  Most of the people, who were around us while we were waiting, were also making their first visit to Snooze AM Eatery.  It will be interesting to see how long the hype can keep crowds curious.  I ordered the corn beef hash.  It arrived with 2 cold eggs, over easy, and a pitiful small helping of burnt has browns with less than an ounce of corned beef.  (I've owned my own restaurant for 30 years, it was less then an ounce.)  I tried 2 bites of each of the pancakes that we had ordered.  The first to see how they were, and the second to make sure that they were actually as bad as I thought after the first bite.  I honestly don't know which was worse, the presentation, or the nasty taste.  They all sounded great on the menu.  Well, they can certainly talk the talk, but they definitely can not walk the walk.  Lets just say that I would not return to this restaurant if it was across the street from my house, with no wait, and it was free.  At 61 years of age, and for someone who has eaten all over the Country, and eats out often, this is by far the worst food that I have ever been served in a restaurant. P.S. I know why they call the French Toast, OMG.  It was exactly what I said as I pushed the plate away."
1,"Awesome food and service, everything was very fresh and melted in my mouth including those vodka shots! \n\nGood times!"
0,"As soon as we checked in to California hotel & casino, we made our way to Market Street Cafe.  It was already past midnight and we had come from LA so we weren't trying to drive around anymore.  Luckily, it wasn't as crazy busy so we were able to be seated right away.  Unfortunately, despite getting seated right away, we weren't attended to right away at our table.  Don't get me wrong.  The server was nice but when one is tired and hungry, niceness can only get so far.  \n\nWhen she finally made her way to our table, my sister-in-law ordered the infamous oxtail soup (now priced at $9.99), my brother ordered the wonton min, and I customized my omelette with cheddar cheese, mushrooms, bacon, & spam.  The food itself was okay.  Nothing to shout on rooftops about.  My omelette was okay, though the combination of spam and bacon made it super salty towards the end, since there were big clumps of them at the other end of my omelette.  The hash browns were okay.  Didn't taste the wonton min but my brother seemed to like it.  I did taste the infamous oxtail soup.  It comes with a cup of rice which my sister-in-law devoured.  The oxtail is cooked perfectly, with the meat falling off the bone easily.  The broth is pretty good but I suppose that since I am Filipino, I'm accustomed to eating oxtail with a peanut sauce (a dish called Kare-kare).  So although the oxtail and the broth was good separately, together, I was looking for something more.  I don't think I'd ever order it again.\n\nDid I mention that our food arrived and we still had no drinks at our table.  When I flagged the waitress down and asked for water, she only brought one for me.  It wasn't until she noticed the shocked look on my brother's face that she made her way back with water for both my brother and sister-in-law as well.  Overall, I probably wouldn't eat here again, unless I had no other choice."
0,"The thing about grocery stores, at least for me, is that you generally go to the one that is closest to your house.  Because of this I usually find myself shopping at this Copps location.  Though this location is very similar quality wise to the other Copps' in the area, the service is lacking.  \n\nThe staff there never seem happy to help and don't seem to know where merchandise is when asked.  I also don't like the layout at this location as much as the other locations.  There are items that seem as though they should be grouped together but aren't.   It's not a big deal because it's just food however it'd be nice to have a really great store with great customer service, and a great layout close by so that grocery shopping wouldn't feel so much like the chore that it is."
1,"Fat Tuesday's was recommended to me by a dear friend of mine who simply said that one of these drinks will f u up.

An extra shot, yes please!! $14 for a yard long and $9 for a refill, sounds like a good drinking night to me. Thankfully, Fat Tuesday are all over the strip in different casinos, so by the time you finish the first yard long, you have already stumbled your drunk ass into another Fat Tuesday. You could probably set yourself on fire if you blow into a lighter after drinking one. ENJOY :)"
0,"People creep into your room and steal your property. hotel doesn't allow you to report it. Do not stay here it is creepy and unsafe. \n\nThis Dana George who commented below me was rude, unresponsive, and accusational. She did not help, none of her staff were capable of following simple protocol because I was transferred between her and her head of security more than three times due to them both claiming it was the others responsibility to help. They promised to call me back and never did. My girlfriend had her Tiffany necklace stolen out from her own locked room. that's a violation of safety as well as property. Imagine if she was awake or had woken up.. what could have happened to a woman in her room that doesn't lock in Las Vegas alone? Especially with such apathetic staff? Of course if you try explaining these concerns to DGeorge she will apathetically wonder what to do and transfer you to security because she's incapable of facing these issues on her lonesome. Do not stay here for your own safety. It would be one thing if the staff were at all concerned with YOU. \n\nYour family, your daughters, your wife, your property, are at risk in this hotel. They ignored our requests, ignored our asking for help, and Elara staff especially their general manager are incompetent and should NOT be allowed around other human beings. That means Dana George DGeorge@hotel manager."
0,They move you from chair to chair as you have services done.  They did not have enough staff and Lannie was working on two customers at the same time.\n\nWhen I went to wash my hands the sinks were dirty especially around the faucets.\n\nNot impressed.
0,"I joined Youfit two days ago and am already beginning to regret it. I don't mind all of the additional fees that pop up when you sign up for the gym (sign up fees, cancellation fees, first and last months payment, etc), but now they are calling on a regular basis to pressure me into giving them a checking account number, which I guard like my social security number.\n\nI pay with cards or cash and do not give out my bank account number to ANYONE. Especially not to a gym that forces you initial a waiver when you join stating they can sell your marketing information to affiliates."
0,"I don't think that I will ever get a bikini wax as long as I live because of my experience at european wax center. I've never felt so uncomfortable and embarrassed. The bedside manner of the esthetician was so cold and careless that I should have pulled my pants up and left. But I decided to go ahead, and even after telling her how I find waxing extremely painful she didn't even give me time to breathe before she was yanking and ripping away. I have never experienced such a painful waxing, I even apologized for jumping. She then informed me to sit still or the wax on my labia would stick together, and \""I wouldn't want that would I?\"" I left the center legs shaking, embarrassed and in pain. When i got home my underwear were dried to my bikini line with blood, there were patches of hair still there and I have some serious bruising. I know that I have sensitive skin, but I feel like this was a bit extreme and definitely not worth it. I feel like I would have had a much better experience had she been more considerate and reassuring."
0,"Ugh. How do you spell DEPRESSING? Well, you abbreviate it, anyway, with the letters: T.I. as it's called on the strip.\n\nDon't go here. It's gross. Everyone's a slobbering mess. \n\nThe dealer tried to take my bet in blackjack. That shit was a push. She realized her mistake and tried to pretend nothing happened. Wow.\n\nIf these were the golden days of vegas, I know just how I woulda dealt with her...A nice knuckle sandwich in the \""back room.\"""

1,Great food at relatively cheap prices. Their steak hoagie is great! I can't tell you about anything else because that is all I get!
0,"Send Gordon Ramsay to this place, it a kitchen night mare!\nNasty food, slow service and cheap decor. So many better all you can eat sushi in MTL."
0,"Went with a couple of girlfriends on Sunday night.  The music, fantastic however the service was not so!  One must mortgage their house to pay for the overpriced drinks that are in glasses so small they could pass as shot glasses.  Our server, rude is putting it mildly..  Samantha (Sam) was slow and rarely checked back with us as she spent most of her time chatting with her coworkers at the end of the bar.  I asked for Disaronno and she laughed with a sarcastic attitude and said she never heard of it.  She never offered to find out if they have it and asked what else could she get instead.  Every time we asked her a question she couldn't hear us because she was wearing earplugs.  Hmmm,  you're working at a place that offers live music, DUH. I'll be back for the music but will not be served by Sam."
0,"Mustang Sally's used to be a nice dinner, with the 50's or 60's atmosphere. It has changed so much, with a look of barely alive, trying to look like a  Star Bucks dinner, yet falling short of that mark. The counter where the cash register used to be is dusty and it looks like it is basically ready to close down. The people that wait on you are not trained for a restaurant, but simply order takers that act like they don't want to be there. Another nice place gone away; it is too bad."
0,Food was OK not great how ever the crab cake was terrible the worst I have ever had. The service was even worse. The staff clueless unfriendly and rushed everything. The restaurant was only a third full . Now I know why.
1,"Even though it is 30 miles away, I will be coming back to Tesoro often.  The osso bucco alone is worth it.  Succulent veal bathed in a light brown sauce sitting on top of parmesan risotto.  And did I mention the bone marrow?  Seriously amazing.  One of the top 3 things I've ever eaten.  The osso bucco alone should merit 5 stars, but the soup was boring and the mozzarella was slightly cold."
0,"OMG!!!!  This is the worst experience I've ever encountered. I'm sitting in the chair now as she \""baby rub\"" my feet. The sea salt was rubbed on my legs for 2 seconds.....literally,  then immediately washed off!  So many other WRONG things she did I don't feel like naming.  Very disappointed!  However, I WILL return & see Henry next time."
1,"Fantastic pizza, especially the deep dish. I called with a coupon from one of those Citipass books and had no trouble using it. I did pick up and the pizza was ready by the time I got there and they got the order exactly right. No issues at all."
1,"I love coming to Crescent mostly because I get to hang out with loved ones when I'm here. My bf's hipster brother lives closeby and we don't get to see him often, so I've always had a good time catching up with him here. We've always sat outside in the patio area and I love it. You can hear the live music from outside but you can still have a conversation without yelling. The servers are super friendly and always bring drinks out fast. I recommend getting some trail mix to munch on with some beers."
0,"Awful. The burger was preformed and clearly just a frozen patty that was fried. I don't mind paying $2 extra for fries, but give some fries for my $2.  Though the fries were the only thing tasty thing they served. Even the soda was flat. \n\nBland, flavorless patty.\n\nIf you are in the Miracle Mile shops and want a burger, go to Blondie's instead."
0,"This place really needs to work on their service. Hiring cashiers is one thing, training them to give good service makes a business so much better. I'm pretty sure this place's management doesn't really care about customers, more focused on loss prevention and keeping the store running."
0,"I stop here on occasion when I'm not feeling lazy and crave a better tasting coffee outside of starbucks drive thru. Always see the same guy working solo which can get a bit annoying if there's a line and I'm in hurry but no big deal. My last visit there will he just that, my LAST. He was more interested in chatting with his wife then he was in serving the 3 or 4 people waiting in line. I probably spent at least 15 minutes just standing there waiting. This to me is unprofessional and uncalled for."
0,"Really I don't like to shop for food at any walmart, but its convenient for us. Yesterday we shopped for a few grocery items. As usual the store is an absolute dirty mess, the employees are rude and majority of the time they do have what we need. The lines are way to long and you can never find anyone to help you on the floor. It makes matters far worst when the past 4-5 times we've shopped here the food is past due. Times before it was yogurt and milk wks past the exp. date. This time I bought pizza pockets I bit into one and it was sour. They were almost 2 months past due. I called to speak with a manager about and they told me its my fault for not checking the date before buying. Lol. Shows you what kind of company this is. I HATE Walmart. Dont care how close it is, I will never do my grocery shopping here EVER again."
1,I've been to Jessie and he does really good work I will always go to him when I need work done
0,"Blah!  I had such an average meal here last night.  I remember it being much better when we ate here a few years ago. However, I was totally unimpressed last night.  We ordered the bisque and I couldn't even finish it.  Not that great.  The halibut reminded me of a cafeteria.  All in all, complete waste of money.  If I want good seafood, I'll head to Mastro's.  Oh, and our waiter never noticed that I didn't eat my bisque, because he never came to check on us.  Average food and below average service. I won't be back.  There are so many better places to eat in Vegas."
0,"OK, so this wasn't exactly a gourmet experience, but I just needed to have some pancakes. This restaurant is a Northwest chain that has expanded through much of the U.S. I got bacon pancakes (i.e., bacon inside the pancakes) and a side order of sausage patties. The pancakes were heavy, the sausage not bad.\n\nToo bad I didn't check here first - perhaps the house specialties (apple pancake or Dutch baby) are the way to go."
1,"I came across this website last week just a day before leaving for my first Vegas trip with my husband. I was skeptical at first since it seemed too good to be true. But this website is pure gold! So easy and reliable and they are punctual and prompt with giving all the info. In the three nights we were there, we hit two night clubs ( Hyde at Bellagio and XS at Encore) and a dayclub ( Marquee at Cosmopolitan). Got late at the first club, so had to pay a cover charge for my husband, but made up for that with the 4 free drinks they provided!! The other two places got free entry and free drinks as promised. Partying in Vegas is out of the world and this website makes it easily possible without burning a hole in your pocket. I have been raving about it to all my friends and colleagues!"
0,"*Update*\nOh... my... GAWD... what happened to you, Safeway? \n\nThe wine selection is about a third of what it used to be. \n\nThe bakery doesn't carry the yummy desserts that it used to. \n\nThe staff... WTF? Does Safeway not have a secret shopper program anymore? I had to return an item, which I had purchased yesterday, but then realized it was 11 days expired. There were SIX employees, literally standing around, as a manager rang up customers and handled my return. Does she apologize? No. Does she ask one of the employees to get a replacement? No... she tells me to go get it and come back to the CS desk. So I grab the item and go back... but she's ringing up another customer and I'm staring at 6 people, who just stare back. I was truly apalled, at this display of mismanagement and apathy. \n\nThis location started off so well, too. I guess that is what happens, as the real estate flopped pretty badly in this area. \n\nTime to select the cheese to go with my whine elsewhere.  Down from 4 stars, to 2. Sad. Just sad. \n____________________________________________________\nI don't care that Safeway charges a bit more for normal stuff. I just love this location. Friendly, helpful people, always yummy stuff in the deli, fresh veggies/fruits, pretty big wine selection for a chain store, and the guy in the bakery is an absolute doll to my cookie-grubbing offspring. This place is really convenient (gas station, gift cards, flowers, Starbucks) but it could have all that and I'd pass it up, if the people weren't so darn nice. Yeah, I know they do (or did) secret shopper, but the cashiers are always really fast, talkative (I'm a total stranger talker) and smile when I have to force my kids to put back the umpteen packs of gum they've grabbed. They make me feel welcome, instead of rolling their eyes when I can't find my card or just gossiping with whoever is bagging instead of saying 'Hi'. Plus, I usually don't have to play 'dodge the f'n shopping cart' in their parking lot. A little ambience goes a long way. You live out this way... try it."
1,"Came here on a whim with the bf for a late night drink and snack and was really impressed by the ambiance of Grit and Grace. The stand-out, spectacular dish of the night was the eggplant marinated in miso. Seriously, this dish blew me away, because the texture of the eggplant is like sashimi in an amazing, original way. Great dish for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. We enjoyed the dim sum as well, but it seemed a little bit less fresh and inspired (maybe because it was around 9 at night), although the kimchi was so tasty. My biggest gripe is with the cocktails, because at $10 a pop they were very light on the booze. I recommend ordering a reliable classic off the menu for a better bang for your buck."
1,"This is my favorite restaurant here for vietnamese-french sandwiches. I like # 116- charbroiled chicken sandwich for $3.99. It is the perfect blend of east meets west- the fresh baked french bread, the meat, the crunchy asian blend of veggies: cilantro, long strips of carrot and jicama, and sauce-mmmmmmmmmm. Yes, it's my fave asian sandwich in LV. (Yeah, I must be one of the few reviewers with positive things to say.) My husband prefers the stir-fry dishes and the spring rolls- pretty good and reasonable too. I haven't had a bad experience here ever in regards to the food, other than the service was ok, a little rushed. Also available are boba drinks. We took a friend here and the line to get seated was almost out the door (tells you how popular this place is). Service was alright, better when it's not so busy. If you don't want to wait, place your order for take-out or try to get there early if it's around the holidays. Participates in the www.restaurant.com certificates program. I feel a craving building up- looks like a visit in the near future is in order."
1,"Best kept secret! Wanted to try it and my boyfriend surprised me for my birthday! I love where it's located, the atmosphere and the wine and food are perfect for the setting. Got the risotto cakes, grill cheese and soup, yum! Had a red wine& price was good. Just went a second time for some wine and the service was great as before. The managers are always helping out too which is refreshing to see! Nothing bad to say. Love!"
1,"The amount of food is about 40% less than the ceasars palace buffet, but the food they have is just as good if not Better. This place is located on floor two of the cosmopolitan hotel next to the bellegio. The dessert is 5 stars by itself ."
0,This place is horrible the food is so over Americanized it didn't even have flavor was Super Dissapointed! I live near by and I will never go back!
0,"After a horrible haircut I called to notify the salon. They offered for me to come back and fix the haircut and even scheduled a new appointment. After I was told I was all set I was asked to hold again fit the third time. The receptionist came back and said they caulks no longer offer me a follow up visit. When I asked why she was completely clueless! I then asked to speak with a Manager and was transferred to a voicemail. In the process I might add, I was hung up on twice but called back even though t was annoying. The \""manager\"" called me back an hour later clueless of the events. After I explained she wasn't willing to do anything for me. I even reminded her that my first call was simply to notify them if the terrible stylist. Still she was not willing to correct the situation. I informed her that I would be taking my business elsewhere."
1,"This is a really great place to sample some beers! I did get the sampler and managed to try eight different beers which was great as this is a brewery. While I'm not much of a beer drinker myself I can definitely appreciate the time and effort it takes to make great local brews. I also ordered the fish & chips which were quite good. Not the best that I had but it's up there. The bartender asked if I wanted to try some seasonal brews which I was surprised about but was glad to try them.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty cool but I'm not sure how I like that industrial feel to this place, then again it's a brewery after all. Service was decent even though there are a lot of younger bar and wait staff here, not that it matters because it seemed like they were doing a pretty good job.\n\nParking situation here is a bit tough but luckily I came at a slow time so it was easy to find parking and be served fairly quickly."
1,"Myofascial release (MFR) is incredible!!! \n\nOkay, now that that's out of the way, onto the review:\n\nI am a professional massage therapist.  I had heard of MFR for years but had never experienced the treatment.  I booked the appointment with Rowena more out of curiosity than because I was having issues.  What I experienced could not have surprised me more.  \n\nI love massages.  A lot.  So I would never tell someone to give them up. But if you want to take bodywork and care for your self to the next level, try MFR.  If you want to try MFR, try this place.  Rowena is an incredible therapist and has an amazing touch.  I am very picky as to who I'll let work on me and could not recommend her more.  \n\nEven though this was a new arena for me, I felt calm, collected, and comfortable the entire session.  I felt incredibly soothed from the minute I stepped into the treatment room, and my relaxed state deepened even further when Rowena placed her hands on me.  The next 90 minutes was sort of a blur and seemed to last 5 minutes and an eternity all at the same time.  All I know is I haven't felt that good in years.  I also felt the work for several days afterwards and continue to have releases in my fascia almost a week later, which is how I truly rate bodywork.  Anyone can make you feel good during a regular massage, but TRUE bodywork is felt in the hours and days after the session.  This work passes that test, and then some.\n\nI cannot recommend MFR or Rowena enough.  If you've been dealing with aches and pains for a while and other methods seem to get close but never really do the trick, give this place a try.  I assure you you're in for a treat."
0,"After spending several hours on-line scoping out sushi spots to celebrate my son's graduation after 9pm on a Tuesday. I picked this spot because it was open late (til 2am), had good reviews and sounded \""family friendly\"". I was a bit disappointed.  \n\nThe food was just so-so. I've had better sushi. It was fresh enough but completely unremarkable. There was lots of differently named rolls. But, we ordered two of the spiciest rolls on the menu (marked by 4 & 5 chili icons) and had to add extra wasabi & ginger just to get a little heat. We even asked the server (who never told us her name) to kick up the heat on the 2nd round - still only worth 2 chillies. The drinks were kinda tasty thought; we got Shiso Mojitos in very small champagne glasses for 3 and half bucks. So that was cool.\n\nThe service was sllllllllow. The server was nice enough (although she made some comment like monkey-see-monkey-do that really rubbed my brother the wrong way). We ordered several rolls the 1st round (about 8). They came out about two at a time with about 10 mins. between each set. So we remained hungry the entire night. Maybe this was the plan for us to order more rolls. But with 7 adults at the table, we'd each have a piece of roll and have to wait for more food to come out. It was frustrating.\n\nThe seating was just horrible. We reserved for a party of ten. The whole restaurant seemed as if it would only seat 50. In order to get food into the main dining area, the server has to pass in front of the restaurant's entry door. This \""restaurant\"" is more of a cafe'. If everyone that we wanted to share in this occasion came with us, the restaurant would not have held everyone. If they have a party of more than ten, I am pretty sure they'd have to close the restaurant to other guests.\n\nThe best part of the evening was the end. My son got a free ice-cream desert for being the graduate. The gratuity was not added in, so we could appropriate an adequate tip-to-service ratio. And the bill for the whole affair was still under $200.\n\nSo if you want an inexpensive sushi meal, this is a good place for it. But I wouldn't go out of my way and make plans to go here. It's a good drop-in-on-the-way-to spot but nothing spectacular."
1,"Love the cosmopolitan and have been to Holsteins a couple of times.  It has a fun and casual decor (hot pink cow in front) matched with a really nice looking bar.  \n\nSat at the bar both times.  The bartenders were friendly and suggestive without being too intrusive.  They have a great beer selection and will help recommend one if you want to try something new.  Although I usually like ordering specialty cocktails at places like this, I noticed that they had bubble-gum vodka (one of my favorites) so the bartender made me a  bubble-gum martini that was delicious! It was pink and girly...definitely what I was in the mood for. \n\nFor food I had the duck 'street tacos'. I love anything and everything with duck, but then add foie gras, and truffle cream and stuff it into a crispy tortilla? yuuummmm! \n\nAlso ordered the Lobster Mac-n-cheese. Its a perfect size portion (so you can eat it all and be guilt-free). I just happen to be a mac-n-cheese connoisseur, so I've had my share of cheesy noodles. This one is really good with the lobster and truffle cream, but not my favorite. However the dish comes with a mini lobster BLT that is so good I would definitely order it again. (You can only get this little mini blt with the mac, it's not a menu item on its own). \n\nHolsteins is a cool hang-out spot.  Not just an ordinary burger joint, they have really creative things on the menu that you wouldn't expect. Will definitely come back, there are still so many things I want to try!"
1,"I made reservations and took a friend to Cartwright's for Thanksgiving dinner.  They had 3 choices on the menu for the event. 1. Traditional Thanksgiving dinner. 2. Filet and 3. Salmon\nSince I had made a turkey dinner the night before I chose the filet and my friend had the salmon. The meal started with soup and salad. The salad had crab and watercress and was really good. The soup was also very good. The filet was cooked to perfection and so tender it melted in my mouth like butter. They served the filet with potatoes and asparagus. \nMy friend ordered the salmon and said it was the best salmon she had ever eaten. She let me try some and it was very moist and delicious!\nI topped off my meal with one of their craft beers on tap that was suggested by the server.  It really added to the meal in a positive way.\nThe service here was over the top, everyone was really nice and right on time with everything. \nOverall I was really happy with the meal and look forward to returning here to try one of their steaks."
1,"We went to Jasmine yesterday for the first time (for lunch) and were blown away!  The restaurant is very clean, the manager so pleasant, and then there's the food.  Mounds and mounds of it.  But quantity does not make for a great buffet.  The quality of the food was extraordinary.  Starting with some of the freshest, prettiest sushi and sashimi I have ever enjoyed.  Flavors just jump out at you.  I never got to eat any of the hot, prepared dishes, but that'll be for next time.  I had several pieces of dim sum which were excellent.  Most especially the sesame cakes and the pork bun.  Then there's the ribs,  Best I've had since leaving New York more than 25 years ago.  If I ate nothing but the ribs, I'd be a very happy camper.  The meat is lean and tender, and has great \""chew\"" to it.  The sauce is more than flavorful.  Oh, YUM!  I never got around to the soups or salads, but, again, that's for next time.  I hope they get lots of patronage and stay around for a long, long time!"
0,"I have traveled a lot in my day. Been to many a ports for air travel and this one just didn't flow. Traffic jams in the cab, security line, terminal walkway, and plane runway. Get there ahead of time so you can rock out with your tunes to all these jams."
0,"Yeah, i'm gonna go ahead and down-grade my rating from my previous review. The lack of awareness and attention you get as a customer is very inadequate. I have ordered take out and dined in since my last review and just wasn't pleased at all. 1. with the quality of the food and 2. with their customer service.\n\nAnother long wait until our server showed up. I wanted to leave but my I didn't want to be like that. It is just ridiculous to me that it would take soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long for anyone to address you once seated. \n\nI won't miss this place too much aside from the Bacon Won Tons. oh, well."
1,"I really don't have much of a sweet tooth, but when I have a craving for something sweet and delicious, I gladly make the 40+ mile round trip for LuvIt custard. \n\nPay no attention to the flavor list on the big menu board- just use it as the pricing guide. The daily flavors are posted on the left side of the order window. They have vanilla and chocolate every day along with 2, sometimes 3 daily flavors. The flavors of the day are also listed on their website for weeks and weeks in advance, so you can plan in advance for your favorite daily flavors. They also offer hand packed cartons (pints, quarts...) to go. \n\nAround the holidays they offer their pumpkin custard which is SO fabulous. I will usually order a quart to have on for a yummy holiday treat.  Besides the pumpkin, my favorites are butter pecan, mint chip, wild cherry, peanut butter, and rocky road. My husband's \""go-to\"" treat is the Western Special. \n\nYeah, it's a bit spendy (@ $3.50 for a massive single scoop in a waffle cone); however, all the custard is made in-house daily with high quality ingredients. You'd spend the same, if not more, for factory-made ice cream from Cold Stone."
1,"I gave this to my fiance as a belated Birthday gift.  We had a great time.  Pete was fun, personable, and a very patient teacher.  He even let us sail longer than the two hours since it was the end of the day.  My fiance had a ball.  At one point the wind was so strong, he and a couple of other guys were trying to race the cars running along I-15!  Definitely would love to do this again and will recommend everyone to give it a try if you like speed and the wind on your face."

I have sent in lots of people who are looking for work, and my self again will be looking forward to seeing what the new shop looks like..Thanks again really amazing job.."
0,Well I made the mistake of not using my trusty YELP app before I ordered from this place. I received a flyer for this restaurant under the door in my hotel room. I called and after a brief and not so friendly conversation with a man on the other end I was told the food would arrive in 30 minutes. When I told him I wanted to pay with a card he upped the price to a random evan dollar amount so that seemed shady in itself. After 1.5 hours I called back to see the status and got some serious attitude from the same guy telling me the delivery boy had 3 other delivers so it was going to take some time and to be patient. 15 minutes AFTER that some tweeker kid shows up with a cold pizza and soggy fried zucchini! Never never never get food from this gross excuse for a restaurant! Soooooooo not work $34 bucks! YUCK!!!
0,"We went here for Charlotte Restaurant Week.  We had reservations for 7:45 and we were seated promptly.  However, it was twenty minutes before we were approached by a server.  Keep in mind the restaurant was only half full.  The waitress finally came by and took our orders.  She was a bit short with us.  We ordered the cornflour dusted oysters as an appetizer.  I think these were the best part of the meal.  They were deep fried oysters served with hot sauce.  About an hour after we ordered, the waitress came to our table and asked me a pointed question, \""Are you two waiting on your entrees?\""\nI wanted to say something smart ass like no we are waiting for a bus, but I'm too nice for that.  She said the entrees would be out in a minute and got them about 15 minutes later.  A full hour and 15 minutes since we ordered them.  (We arrived at the restaurant at 7:45 and got our check at 10)  I had the Black & Bleu Filet Mignon.  It was ok.  I thought the best part of the dish was the two waffle fries sticking out of the mashed potatoes.  The atmosphere of this restaurant doesn't make sense to me.  They have what looks to be two framed posters near the foyer.  One of Bach and the other of Beethoven.  The rest is random old/posh looking items.  I won't be returning to this restaurant because of the bad service and bland food."
1,"Very light and healthy options here from mixed greens salads and kale cleanse smoothies to tuna salad sandwiches (more salad than tuna, but tasty).  I think it makes for a good quick and healthy lunch, not really a place to visit for dinner. I noticed a LOT of people picking up orders to go."
1,"Can't beat Jack's.  You just can't.  It may be the best dive bar in Pitt.  And I say that in the very best way possible.  Def Leopard and darts, with cheap beer and bartenders that were born there (that does not mean they are old either).  You either get Jack's or you don't and if you don't you are really missing out.  Some Southside full-timers may be put off by Jack's popularity, but don't listen to them, it's popular for a reason, it's fun.\n\nThere is nothing fancy or pretentious about this bar, so if you look like you just fell out of an L.L. Bean or Talbot's catalog, you need not enter.  The bar has two sides, both of which can pack em in like sardines on weekends.  If you are barhopping on the Southside, start your night at Jack's to get off to a fun and wallet friendly start.  To impress your out-of-town friends, order up some Jack's exclusive Pumpkin Pie shots, you won't be disappointed, the preparation is as much fun as drinking the actual shot.\n\nJack's is Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh is Jack's, warts and all.  It's not fancy or built for times square, but that's the point.  Jack's might be a little rough around the edges, but it has personality and will win you over in spite of yourself.  Go in with the right expectations and you will leave happy."

0,"I made an appointment for a blow dry online for 10 am. I received a text and an email confirmation. On arriving at 10 am I was told my appointment was for 10.35 am and I would have to wait, in a unapologetic fashion. I went to the awesome trader joes around the corner and arrived at 10.33 am, to see that they already had taken 2 clients.... My hair was started at 10.55 am or so. The blowdry was mediocre. To the owners credit, she did offer me a buy one, get one free deal which I declined, but has not replied to my email. I would have preferred a sincere apology. \n\nGo to the DryBar on 32nd! Amazing customer service and better Blowouts."
0,Got a call from the General Manager John who was very nice and assured me they are not a homeless shelter. Perhaps I will go back and try them again.
0,"this place has gone down since the owners are no longer involved as much! We have been going here for over 3 years and food was used to be fresh, tasty, and service was excellent. Well we went there December 7, 2014 and not only the service we received was horrible. We ordered a plate that showed it had sunny side up eggs in it. so i asked can you be sure the eggs are in fact sunny side up and soft and she said sure. When i got the plate the eggs were scrambled and mixed in with the rest of the stuff on the plate when I complained she gave me an attitude and even at first said we have no money back policy??? but then she refunded us for that plate.  But that's not it... before they used to use fresh lemon juice for their tabouleh sauce so it tasted really good, they use something bottled now so it tastes acidic and really not good anymore, i ordered a Turkish coffee and everyone knows Turkish coffee is served very much the size of an espresso. They brought it in a beer glass and i am looking at it in disbelief thinking these people don't know what Turkish coffee is, anyone drinking that much of a strong coffee will get a heart attack! So no more business from us....  I should give them no stars really."
1,"Well, I guess I have to up this review to four stars since I can't get enough of Rosati's Italian beef.  I have absolutely no idea how authentic it is, but since Rosati's is a Chicago-based chain, I'm guessing it's pretty close to the real deal.  Anyway, it's delicious, and the portions are extremely generous for what you pay (although the delivery charge still sucks).  \n\nAlso, thin crust pizza is the way to go here.  It's still pretty greasy, but not as bad as the thicker crusts.  The individual-size pizza is pretty big for just one person and at a good price."
1,Good honest people. Fair prices on service.
1,"Fun store! Lots of shoes, country/western wear, hats, belts, etc. I ended up buying a pair of ATS red boots that I've had for a month now, and I still get compliments on every time I wear them out!"
0,"I really wanted to love this place...alas, no.\nI spent $50 for the 24 hour buffet pass knowing full well that I would have to pay $15 more at Bacchanal, according to what I read online and the cashier when we bought the ticket. When we arrived, we were told it was $15 more for breakfast, $20 more for lunch, and $25 more for dinner! I sure wish the cashier had told me this at the first buffet!\nBut I was excited by all the pictures online and reviews, expecting gourmet little small bite deliciousness with each spoonful, so I paid my money and waited for my table. The place is lovely, but it turns out its all just regular buffet food in smaller plates. Nothing outrageously delicious. And my husband was sincerely disappointed...having seen previews on the hotel info channel in the hotel, he was expecting made to order, well prepared tacos, along with 1/2 cup portions of shrimp and grits in sweet little cast iron skillets...instead, tacos were slung at him with no fixins' and he received a tablespoon of grits with one little shrimp on them in a small condiment cup. And my fried chicken and sweet potato fries were greasy and soggy. Maybe 5 of the 25 items we tried were noteworthy. Severe Disappointment. Meats were overcooked, sushi didn't appear fresh and the crab, while served by someone at a steam pot, left much to be desired. Our waitress was pleasant, but buffet staff spoke little to no English and were rude, disconnected somehow from the patrons.\nOne thing that was a plus was the dessert area. Better desserts than I've seen at the other buffets, but like everything else - it's the luck of the draw. Some items were either runny or flavorless, but the selection was great and the majority of items were good.\n\nSave your money - or if you really must try it, do it on the cheap. Get the weekday buffet pass, and go for breakfast during the changeover from breakfast to lunch. Not worth dinner pricing. The lunch at Paris buffet was better than dinner here. Good luck and happy buffet hunting!"
0,Treaty was Great!!! But the spa is not the cleanest... The robes they give you where stained and the shoes were dirty... Can we say germs!!!
1,"What a nice little place. Casual but classy, if that makes sense. Totally delicious Shepherd's Pie...I really liked that it had green beans in it, as opposed to all other Shepherd's Pie I've had with peas (ick). I kind of wonder if the big Heritage Square events impact the ambiance, but I'd definitely go back here if I'm in the area and looking for something to do. I do wish they had their own parking... the only parking I could find was in the garage on 5th St."
1,"BEST RESTAURANT I'VE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF DINING AT! HANDS DOWN! \n\nThe people at Mastros truly get it! Service service & more service. My wife & I ate here on our honeymoon & while he food was great, the service was amazing!!!\n\nFOOD: My wife had the sea bass which was incredible. Buttery, delicate, flaky, delectable & flavorful. I had the incredible salmon & I was floored! Not to mention the huge complimentary warm butter cake was THE BEST RESTAURANT DESSERT I'VE EVER HAD! \n\nSERVICE: We ordered the mac-n-cheese but our waiter brought out the wrong side dish. He didn't dispute it, he didn't make a face or impose a funny energy about it AT ALL! He simply said, oh we're so sorry! Keep this one & I'll bring out the correct side dish. Whattttt?!?! Where do they do that at???? Mastro's apparently! They even plate your sides onto your entree plate for you. Ultimately & even more importantly the servers & bus boys energies were warm & full of laughter & smiles. This ..... Is what service is about as my wife & I rave about this place to everyone! This inspired a HUGE TIP! \n\nSYNOPSIS: You so called Michelin rated, 4 star uppity high end restaurants could learn a hell of a lot from Mastro's. They have single handed restored my faith that fine dining doesn't have to equate to stuffy, dry, bland, pretentious uninspired service & energy. 10 stars!"
1,"When looking for a breakfast place & a restaurant has over 800 reviews, well, I knew we'd come here. \n\nA really clean & nice looking restaurant located in a strip mall. \n\nWe had the Greek omelet, biscuits & gravy plus hashbrowns. \n\nThe addition of garlic to the Greek omelet made it go from ordinary to extraordinary! Fresh ingredients & liberal use of feta cheese was tasty. \n\nThe gravy was sausage, bacon & maple syrup. It was bad a**! Very different & lighter than usual gravy. Biscuits were homemade & were light and flaky."
0,This place sucks. They are slow and illiterate. I work at Caesars and they are rude to employees and make us late to return from work. They are also more expensive than other TOURIST price Starbucks locations. You're better off going to the Mirage a short walk away for better service and prices.
1,Great Cinnabons! The only reason I gave them a 4 star is because they have poor customer service. She never smiled at me.  Near gate A30. 8:15pm.
0,"Add me to the list of those who were excited for months seeing the \""Brad's sandwiches and stews coming soon!\"" signs in the Overstreet Mall across from Mickey D's.  I LOVE a good sandwich!  Alas... Brad's has done nothing but disappoint.\n\n\""Toasted\"" subs warmed but far from toasted, small size, average bread, minuscule portions of meat, way too expensive for what you get...  Bah!  What a shame.  Based on crowd sizes I see as I walk by, Brad's days are numbered.  How about replacing with a Which Wich?"
0,"Service felt really rushed and my smoothie was super chunky.\n\nPlus, instead of filling the cup all the way up, the guy just sloshed a bit in the cup and then slapped the lid on.\n\nThen he threw the rest of the smoothie away.\n\nUm. I think I'll just not go to this Jamba Juice again."
0,While the hummus plate was ok.  There were flies everywhere - including on the pastries that were laying out today.  Just sitting on the pastries and flying everywhere.  They wouldn't accommodate my friend who wanted her sandwich in a wrap instead - said it would be TWICE as much.  Not enough flavor in the wraps.  We will not be returning :(
0,"What a dump!\n\nI ordered the chicken marsala pasta and what arrived at my table was completely unedable, it at the same texture and taste as gravy on dehydrated pasta noodles, the chicken was processed and completely gross. \n\nSo nasty, my wife left her supper half eaten as well, lemon chicken piccata, again, processed chicken coved in nasty dehydrated sauce. \n\nWhen the bill arrived and it was over $50 for 2 people I wanted to sue someone. what a complete rip off! their strategy seems to be, fill these idiots up on low grade cheap white bread and pray to god they are full and don't notice how terrible our low grade main courses are. \n\nPlease avoid, unless of course there is something wrong with your mouth or you have too much money in your wallet that you need to get rid of."
0,"Ok, so I gave this place a second shot and pretty much had the same experience as before.  It was just meh.  Tried something different and it was slightly cold again.  I doubt that I'll ever go back."
1,"Everything here was really well executed and the service was terrific. Our group was from San Francisco and there were comments that this is sort of like a San Fran-for-non-SFers kind of a place, i.e. California comfort food with an emphasis on ingredients but not particularly trendy or adventurous. I actually liked that, but it depends what you're looking for. \n\nDishes we ordered included the pork chop with braised chard and farro, truffled macaroni and cheese, cioppino, market salad, and caesar salad. The pork chop was thick, juicy and delicious. The cioppino was full of amazing hunks of seafood. The truffled mac and cheese is one of those things that always sounds better than it actually is unless it's really really amazing, which it wasn't, but it was still fine. I loved the grilled bread they brought more. \n\nIf you like cocktails, order one, because they were very well made. Praline sundae for dessert also surprised us with how irresistible it was, despite how full we were. All of the entrees were in the $20-30 range, with some steak dishes going above that, so it would be easy to make this a real splurge meal or just a nice dinner out, depending on how you order. All in all, I'd recommend it."
1,"Great service, amazing atmosphere, even better food. It was very busy in there but the wait was not long at all. They also give Total Rewards members a discount, which is a plus! I will definitely be back."
0,"Why do craft stores always smell like cinnamon? \n\nMaybe there's some scientific study the Michaels people commissioned where they found that the \""Scent of Christmas\"" causes otherwise sane people to spend obscene amounts of money on those rubber stamps and scrapbooking scissors. I don't know but it freaks me out.\n\nIt also makes me sorta hungry. But what it doesn't do is make me want to buy anything. \n\nAnd the woman in a cat hair-covered black velour tracksuit blocking the yarn aisle ain't helping things either."
1,"The croquet Madame was delicious! I was surprised by the serving size, I couldn't finish the whole sandwich. The fresh made bread was great, soft & slightly dense inside and really made the sandwich. The egg was cooked perfectly (something I've found to be a variable at many restaurants). I also got a white mocha coffee it was very good as well."
0,The complex is beautiful - especially around the holidays!  Lots of fun activities for kids & families.  The pool with the slide is only open from 10-4 - VERY DISAPPOINTING considering the $30/night fee to use it!  The rooms are good sized but are VERY OUTDATED!!!  Prepare to walk a mile to get to your car if you're not willing to pay for valet.......
1,"I don't know why this place doesn't get enough attention by the foodies who visit Las Vegas. Well... Yes it's off the strip, but Orleans offer some cheap table games, and is one of the better places to play poker in Vegas. \n\nThe food is quite good, with consistency (very important in my book). I have been to this place a number of times and was always equal quality. The bread is good. The salad that comes with the meal is good. The steak is good. The seafood is good. It is very nice to see a Vegas steakhouse who serve their meals with salads and sides. \n\nIt is a must for our family when we visit Vegas. \n\nPS: this place won't blow your socks off, but will definitely satisfy your steak hunger without spending bank."
0,"Too many girls.. correction.. too many UGLY hoes (besides us :) )\n\nWe were a like a group of beautiful swans amongst the herd of wilder beasts.\nIf you were to offer VIP access, look with your eyes first, don't just hand them to any fucking short, ugly, fat girl. That wait in \""VIP\"" line was soooo unappetizing.\n\nI thought Vegas clubs got higher standards. \n\nGot in and out in 10 minutes.. never again.. good luck."
1,"I'm a huge Chicago Style Deep Dish pizza lover. Having eaten it in Chicago and all over the country.\n\nWith that said this place serves a very good pie and I highly recommend them. By the way in Chicago you'll get a buttery thick cornmeal crust, lots of garlic, chunky tomatoes. Just like at this place. Good stuff..."
0,"Where to start? We went for our daughter's birthday party. Took a while to get our first drinks. My gin and tonic was soda water. If there was gin in it, it was undetectable. I hate soda water. Never successfully go that corrected. And it was the same with my husband's bourbon and diet. The \""talls\"" were served in Dixie cups. I used a coupon for a free glass of Chardonay. Guess I should have had a draft beer. It was disgusting. The music was so loud, conversation between more than two people was an impossibility. I am familiar with the club scene, so I do have a source of comparison. Strangely, all the music I heard was from 2005-2010. I heard nothing current. Conversation was possible only if you put your mouth in contact with a person's ear.  In spite of the fact there were plenty of tables open and the table had been reserved for two hours., the server was constantly trying to move us to a smaller table as some of the party goers were not there on the dot of 9p. Weirdly, lights were turned off in the back at about 10:15p. It was so dark, we couldn't see the people in the booths beside us. Then a couple came around with a clip board asking for person information for some drawing. I politely told them I keep my private information, well, private and that I did not intend to come back. In short, try a new marketing ploy, thank you. We didn't stay long enough to eat.  Nor did we stay long enough to watch girls dance on the bar at midnight. I mean, REALLY???"
1,They have a great happy hour that we take advantage of.  Cool little guitar player/singer in the corner providing some chill John Mayer/classic rock covers.\n\nThe manager came over and introduced herself and gave us a free app for a future visit.  Super friendly!!  Thank you!!
1,"Lovely little place, feels like having lunch at Granny's. Del-i-cious rubarb pie!\nCheaper, smaller and better service than Elephant House."
0,"I went in to get a quote on a canvas print. The staff at the counter was very helpful and I clearly explained what I needed. I got a quote of $15-20 for the print with a 5 business day turnaround.  I was happy to give my business to a neighborhood establishment, so I placed my order. \nUnfortunately, I received a message the following week saying that the canvas print would be $50 for what I had ordered. I wasn't about to pay that amount and asked if we could adjust the 3\"" border of white to a 2\"" border for $32 canvas print. He said yes, but would need another 4 business days to complete.  This was totally unacceptable since I was expecting a call to pickup my order that I placed a week earlier on that afternoon. I had explained that I was on a time crunch when I placed the order. I would have paid the $32 if it would have been done in the time frame they had told me. But, I might suggest that when you give a quote on a specific service for a very specific size/output, that you be somewhat close.  $15-20 quote that becomes $50 actual price? Really? Thanks but no thanks."
1,Excellent service!  I brought my truck in for tire repair and the wait was longer than expected so I had to leave. I brought in back a few days later and I was not charged for the repair because of the wait.
1,"Bizarre, fascinating, impressive. Some parts maybe 5% were a little draggy, but overall pretty original and funny."
0,"We decided to take advantage of a December $99 special to have a night at the Arizona Biltmore before Christmas. What a disappointment!\nWhen we checked in, they asked us where we wanted to stay on the property. They DID NOT offer any explanation of what was avilable, where it was located, etc. We just needed to read their mind, apparently! As it was raining,we choose to stay in the main building. They gave us a room but when we went up to the floor, housekeeping was still in the room! We went back downstairs and were given another roo - by a very disgruntled desk clerk (with a lovely -not- view of the roof). We got settled and then realized we had no heat - (it was an unusually cold, rainy day in AZ) and a light burned out in the bathroom. Maybe we were in a Super 8! We called the desk and they said they would get someone up to look at it. ONE HOUR LATER, a man finally showed up. By now the room was freezing and very uncomfortable. \nWe wanted to take a walk around the property and asked if there was a guide or map available. They gave us - I kid you not  - a map on basically a 3x3 card. You could see buildings but certainly none of the labels. At this point, we were beginning to think that the $99 deal is no deal. You can stay there but don't expect ANY service or friendliness.\nTrying to shake off our disappointment, we decide to go get something to eat. We ate at Frank and Albert's - another mistake. Soup ordered was barely warm. Very little on the menu for vegetarians, lackluster service, VERY noisy restaurant.\nAll in all, we won't be back. \nWe have stayed at The Boulders in Cave Creek before and our experience there was what you would expect of a Waldorf Astoria property. Beautiful facility - friendly, helpful staff. The Biltmore was the exact opposite. Staff was cold and unfriendly, the accommodations were hugely disappointing. We will never return and we will never recommend this facility to any of our guests."
1,I went to the new location last Wednesday and I have to say I was very pleased. The staff was very friendly right from the time we walked in the door and even when we left at least 3 people that was not my server said bye and thank you. I got the boom dip appetizer and I have never had a better spinach dip. Might not be healthy but worth it. It was recommended by our waitress Sonia. She was so sweet and helpful. We barley told her our likes and disliked and she knew exactly what to order for us. My husband and I got the Alfredo and shared a pizza that had BBQ chicken! I got extra sayce for the pasta but the pizza was perfect. Thin crust and crispy. The portions were great we had plenty to take home. Sonia even boxed and bagged our food when we were done. No room for dessert but we'll get it next time. All in all great experience. Food was great and service was amazing. I'll make sure to ask for her next time to get more amazing suggestions!
0,"Worst hospital ever! Keep driving! \n\nA pair of scissors fell off the counter and punctured the top of my foot. I was dropped off at the hospital and I was bleeding really bad, like bleeding through my wrap and my foot was covered in blood. I was hopping on one foot to get to the desk and they just watched me. There was no one else that they were helping so I felt like they should have got off their a** and brought me a wheelchair. I even asked for a wheelchair and they still didn't bring me one. They gave me paperwork to fill out and I had to hop back and forth to the desk to fill it out and then bring it back.  As I waited with the 2 other people in the emergency room I started losing feeling in my foot.  I once again hopped back up there and told them that I couldn't feel my foot and up through my shin. I asked them if I should be concerned by this and they just stared at me like I was interrupting their conversation about them hating their job.  I then started experiencing terrible pain which seems odd when the foot is numb but it happened. When they called my name I told them that I couldn't hop anymore across the lobby in my flip flops, plus the hopping made my hemorrhaging foot hurt worse.  The lady actually rolled her eyes and had uptight body language while she was trying to help me get in the chair. When they took my blood pressure I once again expressed the concern about my numb, yet in pain foot and she didn't even respond. I was finally wheeled back to the Dr and the Dr said she would give me something for the pain. They did give me a tetanus shot and to my surprise brought me my discharge papers. I refused to sign them until they cleaned the wound. I had to ask them to wash all of the blood off of my foot and I asked if they were going to bandage it up. The guy walked out not saying a word and came back in with a band aid, stuck it on and walked out.  He then returned with discharge papers again and a script for some pain pills. I asked him how I was going to fill that at 12am because I had a foot that I couldn't drive with. He told me \""at a 24 hour pharmacy.\"" Duh! My point being that my foot was numb but in terrible pain, still bloody and he expected me to hunt down a pharmacy? He finally brought me a pain pill to get me through the night and I never did have to fill that script he gave me because by morning I had lost all feeling. This happened in April, it is now October and I STILL have no feeling. When I read my home care instructions the paper totally said that its a concern if I experience any numbness with a puncture wound and to inform them.  \n\nNot to mention, I was sharing a room with a lady that had bronchitis and when she was taking her breathing treatment the tube kept popping off of the oxygen because they had it set too high.  She kept yelling for help because of this and she couldn't breathe but they ignored her... We were both pressing the nurse button and they just kept talking and laughing out in the hall. I even had to yell out to them so they would come and help her. They seemed so irritated that they had to come get this lady's breathing treatment squared away once more. God forbid anyone in the emergency room actually need help. This is absolutely the worst of the worst for hospitals. Honestly, whether you have to drive further to a different hospital or go to this one... You are still risking your life but I bet you would have better chances elsewhere."
0,"The place is in a nice location, but as for the food, I'd wait to see people plates come out and then see what you would like to order. some of the food is basic and basic flavor."
0,"This business has been here for several years, and how its survived I'll never know. The kids that are employed here must get paid next to nothing, cause every time I get up the nerve to try them again, its a whole new crew. Each seems to sass and ignore the customers worse than the last crew did. The wings are good, and I guess its just the fact that there's no competition that they make enough to stay open. This place would kill if the staff just PRETENDED to care about customers. Example: Last time I ordered wings, I knew they would take FOREVER, so I didn't even leave my house for a while. Then when I got there, I was waiting and wanted to pay my bill so I could leave when they got ready. Couldn't do THAT!!!! Had to finish cooking them to release the ticket so she could ring it up. So, they must have waited to start them until I got there, 'cause it was well over ten minutes later when they finally came to the front. (WTF?, WHY CALL AHEAD?????) Then, she was busy helping other people that must not have been able to read a menu, or understand english, and it took several minutes more for her to get my money, so I COULD FINALLY GET MY CARCASS OUT OF THAT PLACE!!!. EVERY time I've been in this place, must be a dozen by now, its been some sort of \""Don't give a flying +++\"" attitude that just insults me to the point I don't want to come back. Presently, I have a STRONG hankering for some of their wings, but it just hasn't been long enough that I'm willing to go back."
1,I love love the waffles at this place so delicious sweet and the syrup is tasty.  I've had only pleasant experience's at Matt's.  The staff is also excellent very catering to your needs.
0,Used to be a great place to visit.  Unitl you have one bartender that gets away with cussing out customers that request Diamondbacks games on the TV's. Guess being in the family means more than the customers.
0,"Meh  Mediocre from top to bottom.  They have a lively crowd sometimes on the weekend which can make it a fun place to drink, but the food is just an overpriced version of Long John Silvers fare.  \n\nTo be fair, it's unrealistic to expect good seafood in the middle of the desert without paying for the expense of flying it in from the coast that day.  Mickie Finz is for drinkin', not for eatin'."
0,"After wiping the scent of dead strippers and hobo urine off my shoes, I've gather the intestinal fortitude to write about this nasty little corner of Vegas. \n\nBefore I continue, I would like to add that this place may be better during the night... when you can't tell that the buildings are falling apart or that the place just smells like urinal cakes.\n\nDon 't get me wrong, there are some worthwhile things to see. Vegas Vic is down there (the neon cowboy, +1 star for him alone). His arm doesn't move anymore, but he is still chillin' on the side of the building. The Golden Nugget and the Fitzgerald Casinos are on Fremont Street also. There are tons of street vendors and cheap food. However, once you step inside the casinos and smell the scent of stale beer and cigar smoke that has been soaking into the stalagmites hanging from the ceiling... you might think twice about eating at these establishments."
0,"I really wanted to give this place a better rating!  I've heard amazing things about it, so maybe that raised my expectations.\n\nI went with a few friends and they called in our deep-dish half cheese, half green pepper and mushroom pizza about an hour ahead of time and it wasn't even ready when we got there.  The waitress kept forgetting about us, it seemed, and the place was packed and not well-staffed enough for the amount of people here.\n\nWell, you guys know how I feel about customer service, so that would bring it down at least 1.5, if not 2, stars.\n\nThe thing is, their pizza was awful!  There was too much dough and not enough cheese; the sauce was a bit under-spiced in my opinion, and the vegetables on my half of the pizza were sparse and didn't taste fresh.  I came in starving and didn't even eat a whole piece of pizza.\n\nI do remember, however, coming here years ago and really enjoying the thin crust pizza.  I saw some other people with it and it looked and smelled a lot better than mine, too, leading to my decision to give Papa Del's two stars instead of one.\n\nAlso, the bathrooms were clean.\n\nThat's about all I have to say."

Did not place the tips correctly. (I did not want to cut down my regular nails. There is a gap between my nails and the tips which shouldn't be there) \n4. There were bubbles in my nails.   \n5. I asked him to round my nails and he thinned them on the sides which is not the same thing.  \n\nOverall, the service was OK. The nails look neat at first glance so I won't complain too much.

We check in all is good except housekeeping doesn't do our room unless we request it.

The cherry on top. On the last day we leave around 11 am come back at 9 pm to find our room was never attended to. I call housekeeping, they say... Oh sorry be right up. 45 min pass no one comes! Oh but wait i call the front desk, say hey its really late we check out early tomorrow, just send up towels, sure they say. 20 min later I get towels. Yes! Finally sleep. 11:35 pm.... Knock, knock.... HOUSEKEEPING!!!! ... Are you kidding me! If you stay please be aware of the chaos!\n\nThen let me move on to the water pressure of the shower, we stayed in room 1531 and the pressure was a joke! I think if my husband spit at me, I would have gotten a little more wet! \n\nThen the commissary we wanted a coffee and a hot chocolate. Long story short they couldn't ring us up after multiple attempts and the manager got so frustrated he just turned around and said it's on us. He himself was very rude to the workers that were trying hard to figure out all the chaos, I actually felt bad for the two girls that were working. \n\nOverall I would say skip this hotel and spend your money is a little more wisely."

1,Great service. Mike was professional and courteous. Best of all they showed up on time. I'm normally navigating a jammed  packed schedule and punctuallity is premium fot me. The price was good and the service was even better. I have found my guys.
0,"Came here over the weekend. The food was OK but IMO $15-$20 is a little pricey for a deli sandwich, but they certainly do give you a very, very large portion. We also had an order of sausages that were way too oily (And I ain't afraid of grease in my food). The thing that left me with a bad taste in my mouth was the service which was possibly the worst experience I've ever had in my many trips to Las Vegas. First it took the waitress forever to get our drinks and to take our order, then when the sandwich came out it almost slipped off our plate and the waitress palmed it with her (probably dirty) bare hand to stop it. We should have asked for another sandwich because that's gross -- even the workers in Ghetto Banh Mi shops in Westminster use gloves to touch the sandwiches-- but we were hungry so we didn't want to wait. I had to ask for refills several times as they never really came by to check up on us and it took them forever to bring us our check. Yeah I understand that they were busy and probably one of their servers called out or something but it shouldn't take 15 minutes for them to bring us our check. We weren't the only ones waiting for our check, there was at least two other tables I saw in our immediate area waiting to pay. The worst part was there were three hosts standing right next to us just chitchatting, I know that it probably isn't part of their jobs to clean tables and print out checks, but they should be helping the servers rather than just doing nothing... it just gives a very bad perception to customers. While the food was okay I will not be coming back because of their lousy service. No I did not tip and BTW they also have a $3 sharing fee. REALLY????"
0,"If you are into partying and insanity, this is the place for you.\n\nIf you are over 25 and want to enjoy Las Vegas, this is NOT the place for you.\n\nWe ate at several places in Cosmo so we were in here often but we just went in to eat and left.  Freaking insane!   People were falling down drunk, people were half naked (and not in a good way), and we saw arrests on several occasions.  \n\nLeave Cosmo to the teeny boppers and head over to Aria or anywhere else for that matter."
0,Avoid this post office branch like the plague!  Waits are excessive and the staffing here is minimal.  The photos here that show long lines are a perfect example of what you will encounter here!  Awful!
1,"This will be my new nail salon even though not close to my home.  They fit me in with little notice, and Le did a great job.  She took her time and gave me one of the best mani/pedi's I've had in a long time.  The salon is clean and the spa chairs are nice. Our only challenge was limited english, but we worked it out. Thanks!"
1,"I was always a fan of the bar that was here previously - \""DrinX\"", however it never really quite took off...\n\nThey have done a tremendous job converting this into Shotgun Betty's. We visited last night, and for a Tuesday night the place was fairly busy after 9pm. Expect friendly staff, good drinks, and great tunes. I have driven by here on the weekends and it is seriously over packed! Follow my lead and try this gem late on a school night."
0,The service/waiter was excellent. Most of the food on the other hand was disappointing. Ordered the Lamp Lollipops for an appetizer and had to send them back because they were under cooked. For dinner I had the pork belly... it was dry and overcooked. My wife had the Lobster Mac & Cheese and it was good- not swimming in butter and cream like many restaurants prepare this dish. I will say the parsnip and leek soup was  excellent. We shared a dessert - the layered sour cream pound cake with almond cream and strawberry's  which was difficult to share due to the narrow opening of the small mason jar it was served in and lacked consistent flavor through the layers.
0,"This is a hard one. I went just for the chips which are the bomb!!!! Decided to get 3 hard tacos.... mistake... I had 2 shells with lettuce,sc,salsa and the 3 rd one had the meat. I want toppings on my meat not just eat toppings. Again I went for the chips and next time I will cut in line and buy just the chips and go next door to Einsteins!!!"
1,"Just a quick review: For solid sushi, this place is great. They don't participate in AYCE, like most local spots do--this is the place you want to go to for a fun, energetic environment and very good quality fish! The service has always been spot on and the dishes are great. Being that sushi can get very pricey, I typically order one of the Entree's and a couple rolls, to share. The Entree's are very reasonably priced and they bring you a lot of food. My favorite roll is the Joe's Special! A MUST!!!!"
0,"Worst service I have ever had at a hooters restaurant. Order took 20min and it was wrong! Totally disorganized staff. What a joke! It was like watching a \""Hell's Kitchen\"" episode! LOL!!!"
0,"It's not a real Vegas trip until you've been to at least one buffet. My friends and I were staying at the Palms so we decided to try the Bistro Buffet. After having the M buffet, this does not compare. A few things we had were pretty gross, and nothing was great. Everything was just.. meh. I ended up pretty much eating only crab legs and mashed potatoes. Our server was very nice and always made sure our drinks were full. \n\nSome of my Thai friends said the Thai food was really good; apparently one of the cooks there is Thai and they talked to him for a bit. I didn't try any of it so I can't say for sure. \n\nGet a Palms Player card before you pay for the buffet so it's cheaper. The seafood buffet was $20 with the card, and I think lunch is only $7.99."
0,"If you come here for a pre-employment hair drug test, DO NOT trust Michelle Garcia cutting your hair. I went in for the drug test & was unfortunate to get this MONSTER. I have long black hair. This witch cut off a huge chunk of hair from the top/crown part of my head, that started from the right to the left then went down to the back of my head. It wasn't even a clean cut. She swore she was making sure you wouldn't be able to see, but she's obviously a liar. Before cutting my hair she kept telling me how beautiful my hair was. I was so upset & I made sure she knew it. Her response was, \""I'm sorry honey.\"" Bitch are you serious?? I quickly shut her up. Don't tell me you're sorry when you intended to do this.  She didn't even bother cutting my hair from 3 different spots, instead she cut a ridiculously chunk of hair from 1 spot!"
0,"Meh. Not a fan.\nSister and I came here after a day of shopping at Norterra. We were famished and super excited for some pita delicious-ness. The restaurant was packed, people were waiting in random spaces so it was hard to tell who had already put their name down or now. We ended up going to the bar.\n\nOur server was super nice and knew a lot about the menu, which was good. The one thing I noticed right away, was that the servers, or employees seemed to all be half dressed. I don't have kids, but there were kids there, and it seems like this is a family enough style restaurant so that was unprofessional to me. \n\nWhen our food came, I had been so excited to try the falafel pita but when I saw it, I wanted to cry and my stomach started to riot. The falafel was burned and bone dry. Made me thirsty just looking at it. and holy onions. There were so many onions, no sauce. just ick. \n\nWe didn't stay long after that. Most likely won't go back."
0,It's a bit old fashioned and not a big variety of rolls.  The place was dead when we visited which didn't help the ambiance. Overall the rolls had little flavor and were bland. It wasn't bad but i don't think I'd go back.
0,"Fuck no. Roast beef somehow manages to be both dry and greasy at the same time. Sides will give you a stomachache and, unless ordered plain, are coated with the same mysterious anthrax powder found on the onion rings at Madtown Burger Company. Yes, they are basically the same restaurant. The only thing I have to say about their chili is \""oh God why\"" and I'm pretty sure they were just as shocked to hear me order it too.\n\nAfter finishing my last order-in meal from here, I literally had to run out of the room after eating it to avoid becoming violently ill from looking at and smelling the leftovers of the abomination that I had just consumed. \n\nThey once sent me a burger with absolutely no toppings on it. Gee, I guess it's my fault I didn't specify I'd like lettuce or maybe a slice of tomato when I called! I sure deserved having to chop up vegetables for a fast food meal that I ordered precisely so I could avoid kitchen labor!\n\nThis whole experience could be emulated with much less trouble. Simply walk into a nearby Arby's, and upon being rung up, dump out your entire wallet in front of the cashier and ask him to dick around for an hour before making and subsequently pissing in your food."
1,"We got breakfast delivered a few times and it was great. Large stuffed breakfast burritos for a great price so delicious ! Great strawberry salad, and variety.  The best breakfast burrito I have ever had ! I will keep ordering the large breakfast burritos. He really hooks you up !"
0,"In its heyday (80s and 90s) I would have given it 4 stars, but it just doesn't have that mall energy or buzz any more. It has too many cheap specialty shops. The best thing about this mall is it is a cool place to go in the summer. It needs some serious updating to be more relevant to the times. However, my son loves the play area and \""choo-choo\""."
1,"One of my favorite Japanese tapa place in LV.  I especially love the foie gras custard and foie gras with soy based sauce (very rich).  If you are in a group, it would be good to get at least one omakase.  We have been going there for the past 4 years everytime we visit LV, and its been consistent everytime."
1,"We ventured here on a rainy Friday night in search of some delicious BBQ and potent drinks. This restaurants is not inside of Green Valley Ranch, as another reviewer claimed. It is located in The District across from GVR, next to King's Fish House.\n\nThe parking was an absolute nightmare. After circling around in the vicinity with three other cars trailing us, we were forced to park in the lot near REI store. The parking lot was a great indication of the wait for a table. When we got into the restaurant the hostess informed us it would be about 30-35 minute way. We decided to wait it. Fighting a spot to wait where you weren't in somebody's way was the tricky part since the bar was also full, and they had a live band performing. Eventually the bar cleared up and we got some drinks. Kentucky tea for me (props to the bartender who took the time to google how to make it) and a Sam Adams for the boyfriend. As we were paying for our drinks our buzzer goes off. Happy days!\n\nWe are seated at a little oddball table near the patio entrance. The server brings us some waters and asks if it was our first time there. We nod unanimously. The server is super friendly and energetic and explains the set up, points out the smokers inside of the restaurant and explains the three different sauces offered: Lucille's Memphis (vinegary, more traditional sauce), Lucille's Original (tomato based with molasses/sweet and tangy), Lucille's Hot & Spicy (a little bit of a kick, but I wouldn't call it spicy).\n\nHe brought us over a couple of fresh biscuits with the apple cinnamon butter. Yum!\n\nWe started off with an appetizer of BBQ Rib Tip - half portion that was plenty! ($8.99) These were succulent and tasty. I would highly recommend.\n\nAs an entree I opted for Lucille's BBQ Tri Tip Sandwich ($13.49).. the taste was excellent and the meat was not dry, but it definitely did benefit from extra sauce. Although it is marinated in original sauce, I opted to add Memphis sauce on top of it. It gave it an interesting flavor, and added moisture did not hurt either. As my side I opted for mac and cheese which was pretty standard and not memorable in any way.\n\nBoyfriend opted for the ever so popular Lucille's Original Pulled Pork Sandwich ($10.99) It was great especially with the Memphis style sauce. He had a side of garlic mashed potatoes, which once again, were just a forgettable filler.\n\nI had another Kentucky tea before we called it a night. The server was great without being over bearing. He seemed to appear only when we did actually need something (another drink, water refill, a box to go). Otherwise he didn't pop in ever minute interrupting dinner. Huge props to him.\n\nLucille's offers great BBQ for Henderson folk. It gets crowded so make a reservation. The sides were not that great, but overall food was delicious and service was flawless. I will be trying it for their happy hour which I am told is from 4pm-6pm and they have some great food specials during that time. Yipee!"
1,Un bar vraiment sympa! Les serveurs sont tr\u00e8s gentils! Bonnes boissons! Bonne musique en fond (dont le son est un peu augment\u00e9 \u00e0 partir d'une certaine heure le soir)! De l'espace pour accueillir pas mal de monde! Des cendriers qui aspirent la fum\u00e9e de cigarettes pour \u00e9viter d'enfumer les voisins?! Quoi demander de plus?
0,"This location is probably the least friendly I've encountered. I walked around the store 3 times looking for a certain department, and during that time, I could not catch the eye or attention of a single employee. I had to go to a register to ask a question and did not get a very friendly or helpful response. If I didn't have a gift card to spend, I wouldn't be returning to Kohl's at all. I definitely don't plan to return to this location."
0,"I wanted to treat my girlfriend to a wonderful seafood lunch to someplace we never tried before,and this place had great reviews. I literally watched my food get cold in the window while I watched my server serve several other tables that came in after my table. I spent over $150 on two people and she was a terrible server. I had to track down other waiters to get our drinks refilled and to ask for my food that I knew was sitting at the pass. I feel terrible tipping less than 25% because I used to serve tables, however I left our awful waitress $1 and a message on the bill, and I used no profanity. I politely told her to use better practices when serving customers.When I did find other waiters to serve us refills, she would come over and just drop the drink off without saying anything. I actually had to ask another waiter to grab our bill. It isn't like we were curt or loud, and I always make sure when I go out with people that they are polite to the waitstaff! She just ignored us. I will never recommend this restaurant or ever patronize this establishment again!!!!!!"
1,"Without fail, we always make it a habit of stopping by the check out the exhibit when in town. The memorial day featured an eagle made of flowers over a huge replica of the liberty bell. Great for photos, a short pleasant stroll with sun shining thru and plenty of people smiling."

0,"I'm seriously so over sprint. Spotty coverage, half the time my apps don't work because of low coverage... dropping calls, etc. Not to mention messing up payments and bills.\n\nTonight, however, I'm livid. My iphone died and I plugged it into my charger for 30 minutes. No luck. I tried two other chargers and still nothing worked. So I took it in to the store.\n\nSome employee with blondeish hair and black rimmed glasses came up and immediately acted annoyed he even had to help me. I explained my problem and said he could try plugging it in to their charger but \""if its anything more than that, youre gonna have to wait\"" Ummmm ok, rude.\n\nHe told me it was working fine and that I could just buy another charger if I wanted. No, I'd rather not waste my money. I got home and its been on the charger making the same screen it made at the store for an hour now, and it's still dead.\n\nSprint might want to have knowledgible employees when it comes to Apple if they're going to be dealing with iPhones. Guess I'll head over to the Apple Store for help tomorrow. Sprint and their employees are useless."
0,"Ok, this place has decent food.  Well, depending on the day.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not.\n\nHowever, for a small mom and pop place, they don't seem to do much to make people feel welcome.  \n\nThe last time I ate there was the last time.  I had breakfast with a friend of mine, and all was going well, weak coffee aside.  We ordered some breakfast, and the waitress (who turned out to be one of the managers or supervisors) asked if we wanted gravy on our potatoes.\n\nMy friend said \""I'd love it on the side, please\"" only to be told \""No.\""  When he said \""no?\"" she replied \""Gravy is complimentary, and you either have it on the potatoes or no gravy.\""\n\nI made the choice then that if one bowl for gravy was too precious to wash, then I would save them the time and effort by not going back.  Problem solved, all dishes are clean!\n\nSkip it and go to Sam's cafe."
0,Delicious food. Horrible service at this location. Go to the Southern and McClintock location for better service and friendlier staff.
1,"Red Robin is a pretty awesome place to go for any occasion. My California Chicken Burger was delicious! I also had a mint chocolate chip milky milkshake which was AHMAAAZING!\n\nCan't complain. The atmosphere was super retro and clean. I love how the walls are decorated with pictures. There were flat screen TVs...that was entertaining! This may sound weird, but the seats were super comfy.\n\nOur waiter was good. He was a good server but just a little bit unfriendly? Maybe he was just on an off day or something...\n\nMy experience with Red Robin was overall great! I would recommend this to a friend! :)"
1,"This place is ridonkulous.  I don't use the word \""ridonkulous\"" often but this place deserves it!\nAYCE is phenomenal.\nWa Salad is some incredible sashimi salad concoction that deserves it's own platform to perform on.  Kid friendly yet posh looking on the inside.\nStanding ovation.  I will be back.  Maybe even tomorrow.\n\nMoved down to 4 stars from 5.  This last trip back, the food was still good bit service not so much."
0,"20 bucks to get in and the crowd was scarier than the Mix on a Sunday afternoon. Sorry Vegas, this place is the worst..."
1,Love it. Everything is delicious and everyone is friendly. Feels like the kind of coffee shop I would come across in a quaint vacation town and wish we had at home (if that makes sense?). Love the kids play area.
0,"We went to this restaurant this morning and were very disappointed. The service was horrible (they never brought my decaf coffee, never checked on us and never refilled anything without us having to wave them down). As for the food, it was just average. As breakfast lovers, we were looking forward to trying out a new place. Unfortunately, we won't be going back."
0,"Finally got to Greenberg's for their Pastrami Sandwich.  As I watched the little lady do the slicing, I was thinking, man, she is piling it on. My mouth was watering with anticipation. When she placed it on the counter, that pastrami was bulging all outside that rye bread like a fat lady in tight spandex.  Man I was ready! Then I bit into it.  Where was that  Pastrami flavor? I salted. I mustard it up, to no avail. Where was that peppery taste?There was also a fatty taste that lingered all up in my mouth. I checked the meat and there was the normal amount of fat to it. I couldn't figured it out. What happened to all the hype about this deli? Maybe it was a just a funky slab that day. I will give it another try, because you can't beat that meat pile up  for Ten Bucks."
0,Don't bother with the JFK exhibit. It's overpriced and has very few items. This is a ripoff.
1,"Amazing dinner with friends!  Two of my girlfriends and myself met for dinner Saturday evening.  What a great experience, everything from the service, recommendations and the FOOD was great.  Our server Kara could not have more more pleasant, helpful and fun!  We shared 3 apps, seared octopus, crab legs in a jar and frog legs.  All outstanding.  Would highly recommend giving this cute place a chance!"
1,"I recently went back to NStyle to have my nails filled and decided to try having my eyebrows threaded.  \n\nLike the first time, my nails were pampered and they looked gorgeous.  My nails had to be shortened and the gel had to be refilled.  I was not disappointed by the results. Sometimes when you have to get your nails refilled, they tend to look somewhat 'used' and not as 'fresh' and clean as the first time they were applied, but this was not the case. The end results looked just as awesome this time around. They looked as though they were put on for the first time.\n\nNow for the threading.  I had heard that this could be quite painful and well....it was. But it wasn't more painful than having them tweezed or waxed. Fortunately, the procedure doesn't take a long time. The girl who threaded my eyebrows was courteous and professional. I actually prefer to have them threaded since I feel that the finished result looks more polished. Furthermore, the regrowth of the eyebrows seems to take a longer time....but I may be delusional....jokes aside, and more importantly, Nahila (I think that is her name), took the time to match my eyebrows that had unfortunately, looked like they had been separated at birth.  Now they actually look like twins !!"
0,THE WORST. My usual 24/7 nail place was closed the other night so I decided to give this place a try. I should have listened to the reviews it was AWFUL. Mum was there who is raved about but there were also some other women there as well. When I walked in one young girl didn't greet me at all she just asked what I wanted done no hello or how are you. I told her two pedicures for my girlfriend and I and we were told o pick a color. AS I was picking my color Mum and one of the girls were fighting over who was going to be working graveyard. THE GIRL WAS SO RUDE AND LOUD I CONTEMPLATED WALKING OUT. It was extremely UN professional. I stayed however because I was in desperate need of some pampering. I sat in the chair and soaked my feet. NO ONE WAS IN THE SALON EXCEPT ME MY GIRLFRIEND AND ONE OTHER CLIENT. There was Mum and another young girl who was with a client at the time. Mum saw me filed one toe nail then got up without saying anything and started making phone calls and went to the restroom etc. making me wait 15 minutes after she started my pedicure with no explanation.. when she was getting the dead skin off my feet she was not gentle and used a cheese grater!? Which left skin that was lifted on the bottoms of my feet! Not to mention Mum was preoccupied with everything else other than MY pedicure which I was paying her for. SHE DID A SHIT JOB! THIS PLACE IS A JOKE DO NOT COME HERE EVER. OVER PRICED SHITTY SERVICE AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE DOING. BEWARE.

0,"Rao's, you suck.\n\nFor the price, I expected so much more.   The wife and I grabbed a quick lunch here today during my break at the conference.   The four cheese pizza, for some $15 or so, was pretty tragic.   I think I could do better by grabbing a frozen pizza and popping it in my oven.   As for the 2 meatballs for $17, are you effin kidding me?!?!\n\nNo really?  Do you want me to bend over so you can sodomize me, next?   Because clearly the prices you are charging are exhorbitant!   It's absolutely ludicrous and so not in line with the quality of your food."
0,"I can't seem to understand 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality, its one of the worst I've ever been in, and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez, Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day.\n\nYes, Majerle's is worse.  \n\nOkay, well, no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul, but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of Hell.\n\nThe set up is terrible.  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS (!) at one time, they are both showing the same game.  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games.  \n\nMoreover, i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch.  \n\nThe bar is always crowded, which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food.\n\nI wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at Sports Illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top 1,000 sports bars in the US."
1,"This is the first time we took our daughter for brunch and it was such a different place, of course, then the nighttime or happy hour. The music was quieter, the food was better looking, and tasted better. I will totally do brunch again! My daughter loved it! My only reason for not giving 5 was because the service was just okay, we needed drinks and waited forever. Also their prices are very high for a brunch."
0,The worst watered down drinks ever. Bad food. Super expensive. Super lame service. Ugly people. Nice location.
1,"I had eaten some of their Tres Leches cake at Three Amigos before, and I finally decided to make a trip out here for myself.  Oh my goodness, I am in love with this bakery!\n\nKnowing that their Tres Leches was the best I've ever had, we decided to get a couple of pieces of that and two other pasties.  It came out to around $11.  On our way out, the lady working at the counter offered us a custard out of the case.  It had passion fruit in it, and I'll be darned if it was not one of the most delicious things I had ever eaten.  It was like a creme brulee with fruit mixed in (except no crust on top).  Yum!\n\nI can't wait to come back here again, because this place is cheap, friendly, and delicious.  Now if I could only remember the name of that fruit custard..."

1,"A special place for me...\n\nA few years back in Seattle my fiance (then boyfriend) and I had some vouchers to McCormick's and went for our first anniversary in January and still had some left over so we went for Valentine's Day that February.  We like it so much we go there for our anniversary every year and since the first year we have always sat in a \""snug\"" which is a private booth with a curtain so you can have a nice quiet meal with your dining guest.\n\nThe food is always fantastic and I always leave stuffed and satisfied.  I always order seafood (usually fish) and my seafood-averted sig other usually gets steak.  I think it can be romantic if you're dining in the snugs, but if you're out with the rest of the diners it's just another nice dining room and can be a little on the loud side.  We have no complaints and will continue the anniversary dinners and more.\n\nTheir happy hour is fantastic.  The drink specials aren't anything to write home about, but the food is worth the trip.  The burger seems to always be around and I recommend the fish tacos if they show up as well.  I've never had any bad meals and the ever-changing menu keeps us coming back for more.  I've had many, many desserts and they are all fantastic.  The creme brulee is a solid choice and the flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce is as sinful and decadent as it sounds.  The wine list is somewhat short when it comes to \""by the glass\"" offerings, but I never have a problem finding one I like.\n\nAnother little-known perk is their Preferred Guest Membership.  You are awarded points for every dollar you spend.  If you are a frequent visitor like myself, then it's worth it.  Otherwise, it could take far too many happy hours to rack up enough points for anything substantial.  The best part - it's free.  Details are on their website.\n\nI've also been to two other locations in Seattle and Bellevue and have had great experiences there as well.  Eat, drink, repeat!"
0,"Nosh and Swing got lots of good reviews when it first opened and I was excited to try it. A Groupon was released for it a few months after opening, so I bought it and ate there a couple months later. In short, it seems a place that doesn't know what it is while trying to be everything at once. It's a place where they try their best to be bold and playful and modern all at the same time and it all clashes in a way that is confusing to the palate. Think of all the recent culinary trends...small-plates for sharing, pork belly bao, bold cooking with bacon, clever names, etc...this place tried to do all of it.\n\nFirst, the environment. It's in a pretty run-down strip mall. Once you go in, the space feels cold and uninviting due to the metal on the walls and the metal tables. The items on the menu made no sense being together. They had pork baos (on the menu as pork bun tacos), some asian-inspired chicken wings, ceviche, albondigas (meatballs), fried elote, monte cristo, carne asada sandwich, etc. I had the waitress just bring us her favorites because I had a really difficult time trying to figure out what I wanted.\n\nWe tried two drinks. The \""chata-effup\"" (a spiced cinnamon rice drink which is essentially horchata) and the Mint & Basil Lemonade. The lemonade was decent, but the chata-effup was pretty watered down, making it very unsatisfying (imagine a half-milk-half-water blend). The drinks were served in large mason jars. Again, completely unnecessary. Why am I being served my drink in a mason jar? Nothing about Nosh and Swig indicates a reason for mason jars. It's just being done because it's \""cool\"".\n\nThe food was okay, but not great. The best thing we had that day was the Cornflake-breaded fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was well-fried and the waffles were decent. The only flaw was that it came with a blueberry sauce which was a lot more watery than I'd like (it just soaks into the waffle and makes it soggy). The other dishes all missed the mark in some form. The pork bao tacos really needed something to brighten up the taste a bit. It was a very flat and muddled in flavor. Same for the ceviche. The ceviche had soy sauce and a few other sauces that made it a very salty dish, yet it was in desperate need for some acid. The monte cristo was completely lacking in any flavor and had way too much bread for what little was inside.  For the poor quality and the small portion sizes, Nosh and Swig is vastly overpriced.\n\nWe skipped dessert because we were pretty disappointed in our meal. In the end, we paid just over $50 for two people (2 drinks, four dishes) and left trying to think up a place to go to dessert to lift our spirits. I was very annoyed at the whole concept of the place and the food did not make up for it at all."
1,"I really enjoy this restaurant - the sandwiches, the salads, the mac & cheese, and the  sweet potato fries are all good. I also love that they have a gluten-free cheat sheet that tells you what meals are gluten-free as is or how to modify many of the items to be gluten-free."
1,"Loved it. We went there around 6 pm on a Thursday and did not have to wait in line at all. The desserts were great. I think the food was more rich than Bacchanal but the Bacchanal has more selections. The ice cream/ gelato was amazing. I like how you can order your on mac and cheese. Also, the pizza was awesome. It does not taste like those other crappy pizzas you get from other buffets. I also recommend trying the mashed potatoes. Also, good service!"
0,"I would not go back here....EVER! The woman working the door accused my ID of being fake. She asked for a second form of ID. I pulled what I thought was my credit card out of my wallet, however, the bartender at the previous bar gave me the wrong card! Obviously, this did not help my case. I showed her two more credit cards with matching names and asked if I could go back to the previous bar, get my credit card from the bartender, and come back. She said no and threatened to call the police! I told her that was fine with me (I had nothing to hide). Instead, she called her manager over to look at my ID. He sided with her and told me that even if I came back with my credit card, I could not come in because \""you called my employee a B*#$@.\"" I was SO taken aback, because I was not intoxicated and would remember if I called her that name, which I absolutely DID NOT. My friends and I left and went to a different bar. I understand this establishment probably deals with fakes very frequently, but I was extremely disappointed that they were so rude; it was uncalled for. Do not plan any parties here, because you aren't guaranteed that everyone will get in."
0,"I wish there were negative stars I could put for this place.  One of the most unprofessional experiences I have ever had with a business owner, not even a worker.  I was yelled at, mocked, and generally treated like crap for checking up on a remounting job that was supposed to be done within a week.  Emotional mess the rest of the day.  I have never been treated that way with any owner of a business.   I work with restaurant owners for god's sake!   Unbelievable.   If you want the full story, email me and I will tell you the whole thing.  As it is right now, DO NOT patronize this business.   There was absolutely no excuse for his attitude."
0,"Yikes! It's been a while since I was last here but this place has taken a turn for the worst. About 10 other patrons in here when I went and it was dead silent. No music, no tv volume, no talking- no energy! The appetizers were mediocre at best and while the service was fine, the food and atmosphere really ruined the experience. Will probably skip a return visit in the future!"
0,"2nd and final time using this company, the first was in Burbank and 2nd in Vegas.  I rent cars weekly for work and this is by far the worst company I have ever used.  Slow, staff is rude and the system is antiquated at best.  Do yourself a favor, pay the extra money and rent from a better company.  Wish I had!"
1,"I took a friend in here recently who loves old man style pubs with great food. I have frequented the Ship on the Shore but never eaten in there owing to the fact that my other half has issues with all things out of the sea.\n\nIt was a Tuesday and the place was packed but we were seated immediately (I think more down to luck than anything!). They didn't seem to have enough staff on to cope with the influx as we did wait quite some time to order, have plates cleared etc...\n\nNow to the whole point of my review...the food. WOW! I have to say I didn't have a single thing that wasn't exquisite. I highly recommend the hot & cold smoked salmon for starter as it was out of this world in terms of flavour.\n\nMy friend loved the place equally as much. \n\nI think my other half can suck it up and sit with a bowl of chips the next time I'm in the mood for seafood as I have to go back there."
0,"After we were seated, the waiter had taken our order. We had ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp for an appetizer, a side salad, sea bass, and ahi tuna. \n\nThe gentleman sitting to the left of us received his burger, complained about it being \""medium instead of medium rare\"", and had it replaced by the time we got our Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer.\n\nThe couple to the right of us (who were seated after us) had their appetizers and was finishing up their main course by the time i got my side salad. This is when i started to get impatient. I mean, its AHI TUNA! Its seared! Not even cooked all the way!!\n\nAfter awhile, we had decided to pay for our tab and leave. I asked the hostess for the check and the manager came out, apologized and was nice enough to covered our bang bang shrimp and side salad. \nI was a waitress before so i do understand things get backed up and was going to try Bonefish another day.... \nBUT when i went to the table to leave a tip, our waiter went to K.L and said \""its only been 18 mins since your salad came out\"". WHAT?!?! We have been seated for over 40 mins and all we got was an appetizer and a side salad!"
1,Excellent. The service was wonderful. Never feel rushed. They got us in on last minute notice on a Friday night and stayed open well past closing. Would go again on next trip to Montreal   Food was yummy as well
1,"If I am up late and my tummy is grumbly, I am almost certain I am going to end up here to get two of the best slices of pizza I have had in Phoenix.  The ingredients are fresh, the pizza is never burnt, the staff is what you would expect from a tough-guy-hole-in-the-wall pizza joint on Grand Ave, the specials are different every single day, they deliver, GAPC offers whole pies and slices.  I used to have the high score on some of the old arcade games there, so if you beat my score, you have to buy me a slice since I was the one that told you to come here in the first place."
0,"We dropped in for dinner; excellent service.  The mojito was also very good - left me wanting another!   \n\nBUT DH didn't enjoy his Kobe burger - the ciabatta bun was too dense to enjoy the tender beef...   They don't yet have a kids' menu, and the burrito we \""special ordered\"" for our son didn't live up to expectations - we asked for guacamole and sour cream (among other things) and it contained neither.  Bah!  Also, I'm told there was an \""inappropriate\"" picture in the men's room, if you're planning to take your kids to the toilet. \n\nOverall a disappointing visit - almost entirely due to problems w/ the food.  Not good if you're in the business of feeding people!"
0,"The fambam was hungry and had a late start to our morning. We wanted something quick, located inside our hotel. Although we were avoiding buffets, we decided to give this place a try and didn't check Yelp....bad idea. Eggs and omelet tasted like plastic, juices tasted watered down, flies around pastries...ugh. Will definitely not be back.\nOn the plus side, wait staff and employees were very friendly and helpful."
1,"I had a great time here and the only complaint I got was the place being too small for the amount of people they let in. The music was great, a lot of attractive people and everyone seemed to be having a blast. We got bottle service which came with nice comfy seats that fits four in front of one of the pools. For the boos, we got blended redbull vodka which was bomb! Never had it blended before.. The strawberry vodka was also refreshing and tangy.\n\nIf you want to party daytime, this is one spot you want to hit up."
1,"The treatments I had here were wonderful! I took my mom her for a post mothers days present, and she as well was very happy with the services. We got the Spa Me package which included a facial, a massage and a foot scrub. Everyone there was very friendly.\n\nThe facial was good. During the extractions I felt like there were a few that weren't quite ready to be popped that she really went at. As for my mom, a few hours after the massage her face got red and inflamed and for the next couple days her skin peeled, but she said after the dead skin peeled off her face looked and felt younger and healthier! She was VERY happy with the finished results. (shes also 56 and had never had a facial before so I'm sure her face was just really past due for a facial)\n\nFor our massages we both had the owner of the spa. She was REALLY good! We both prefer a firmer massage and her pressure was excellent. She had a natural instinct for finding knots and getting them out. She used many hot towels in the session which for me is a major plus!\n\nThe spa itself looked like an old dentist office or something that was turned into a spa. The rooms were a little bit on the small side, but I mean once you're in session it really doesn't matter. I'd rather be in a small room and has an amazing session than be in a large room with a not so great session. And she did a good job with making the rooms look cute.\n\nAll in all we were both very satisfied with this place. I would definitely come back here next time we visit!"
1,I absolutely love this place. A great place to take your family. Everything on the menu is Delis!! I would recommend the sweet tea or the coo laid
1,"Support your local small business. This is an independent pharmacy on the Southwest side of town. They will value your business and treat you with care and compassion. Give them a shot and you won't be disappointed. They accept most insurance. Really fast, friendly service. I get all my prescriptions filled there now."
1,"Well done, Cartel.  Well done!\n\nI am in town for business, and needed a cup of coffee that is nearby.  Not having a rental car, I needed something within walking distance of my hotel ... who knew I would luck out and find this hidden gem so close! Not only was I very glad that I didn't have to fall back on my \""safety cup\"" (SBUX - also nearby.  After all, when aren't they?) but I was very pleased with both the quality of the coffee as well as the friendliness of the barista.  (She happily shared that she and her sister had just returned from a barista competition in California and came back with not only some new tricks she was eager to try out, but a new-found love for her job.  Passion like this is rare, and I firmly believe is the secret ingredient to a successful cup of coffee).\n\nMy drink of choice is an americano with an extra shot, some cream and a couple raw sugars. (I know, I know... but hey, I like what I like!) That being said, it's also a risky choice. If the grind isn't right, I can often get stuck with an extra strong cup of undrinkable sludge.  My fears were quickly laid to rest as I took that first wonderful sip... Eureka!  Amazing.  \n\nThe only knock I would say is that they have the simple syrup for sweetening instead of granulated raw sugar (which is my preference). But, you know what?  That's the beauty of their shop... they do it their way. And the other thing?  While I was waiting for the bottle of syrup to be refilled, I snuck a sip without sweetener, and quickly realized I didn't need any sugar. It was silky smooth and wonderfully full flavored all on it's own (the way, I imagine, it's supposed to be, right?).  About the time I realized I no longer needed any sugar, she brought out the new bottle... and while feeling bad for making her go through the trouble for me, I passed on the sweetener and enjoyed the cup the way it was: perfect.  (I did pretend to put a couple pumps into the cup so she wouldn't feel like she did that for nothing.)\n\nThe atmosphere has a cool urban industrial vibe to it, and it really works.  The only bummer is that it was somewhat hidden and hard to find (nothing that pacing up and down University for a few minutes with my iPhone didn't fix, though).  But like wine is better for the struggle the grapes have to go through in the dry environment, this coffee tastes better because of the sense of adventure in finding it. Okay, now that may be a bit of a stretch, but it was definitely worth the little extra bit of effort to find it.  \n\nI really like the name as well.  We all talk about caffeine as a drug, and the hardcore coffee drinkers (like myself) are addicted and willing to suffer less than ideal cups of \""coffee\"" just to get our fix and avoid the dreaded headaches. So in a way, your barista is like your dealer... and their supplier?  The place they get their \""stuff\""... a cartel.  Brilliant.\n\nAll in all, this is a great joint and I look forward to the next four mornings here in town, because I know where I'm getting my fix..."
0,"Bad, just bad.\nFood is underwhelming. My friend did not like her wine after one sip and asked the waiter to exchange it for something else. He actually balked and said he would have to check with the manager before he could do that. What???Are you kidding me? Big mistake. Then I tasted my incredibly weak margherita, all sweet, horrible. Yea, they sell you an 18oz. drink, but whats the point if it sucks. Decided not to deal with the bartender directly instead of flustering our waiter again. Walked up to the bar and in a very calm, and nice way explained to the bartender that I was underwhelmed with my drink, that it was too sweet and I could not taste a hint of tequila. Well I guess tha was an insult, and instead of dealing with me as a customer, she told me that she made the drink and there was basically nothing wrong with it and nothing she could do. Really?\nThis is the type of badly run, corporate restaurant I cannot stand. No owners to deal with, no one that cares, just crappy service and a culture that forgets about the customer. Owners need to go into a Houston's and see how a large corporate restaurant should be run."
0,"Well, I'll never get that 20 minutes back.  The bad and ugly..not sure there was a good.  \n\nI phoned the 7th Ave location of Edible Arrangements thinking it was the closest to my client's office.  There is a $12 delivery fee to drive less than 3 miles.  Seems a bit much to me.\n\nI was on hold for over 10 minutes. I think the poor guy on the phone was the only employee working at the time.\n\nOverall, the entire experience was unpleasant.  The product seems overpriced, along with poor customer service.  I'd rather give my client a fruit tray from AJ's."
1,"My husband and I agree, best buffet Downtown! The hotel is crap, but the buffet is great!  The cafe is just as good if you don't want to do the \""buffet thing\"". BLT is to die for! Make sure you make a stop here to eat while you are experiencing Freemont Street! http://www.fremontcasino.com/dining/paradise-buffet-and-cafe\n\nThumbs up!"
1,"Surrender is the new spot in town overthrowing XS as the new king of Vegas. Its sexy, sophisticated and in a league of its own. This club is not your typical megaclub and the majority of the time will be spent outside.  \n\nI was there this past weekend  and the lines were already wrapping thru Encore at 1030pm!.Good thing me and my group do not wait and we already had a hookup for a cabana for the night for an ultra low minimum. Within 5 minutes, we were on our way in.   Heres a little peak of the cabana area   \nhttp://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs292.snc4/40933_10150276814820241_557670240_14516208_3681604_n.jpg\n\nTo be people in previous reviews complaining about the hosts and stuff, do some research and head over to www.jackcolton.com, and you'll do vegas right.\n\nThe music was mainly house which is what i love! It was Aoki's friday but he was not there that night since he had a prior engagement in Germany. The music was on point all night. Mainly house with some mashups and occasional top 40.\n\nThe pool is off limits unless its their Dip N Dance event held every thursday. So ladies, this isnt XS where you can dance in the water. They also have tables to gamble at just like at XS. Drinks are you typical Vegas prices so no one should be shocked at the prices.\n\nOverall this is the spot to be at. If I were to go to only one club all weekend, Surrender is the spot."
1,"I decided to walk a little around the strip mall after an extremely awesome omakase dinner at the new Kabuto restaurant, debating if I should get ramen at their sister restaurant Monta. Before I could make up my mind, plus I was distracted from yet another Sprint dropped call, I saw the well lit Volcano Tea House.  So like a moth drawn to the cool blue electric insect imploding devices at modern camp sites, I decided to drop in for some more sweets and a side order of free radicals for my body to fight off.\n\nThe interior is not big, but it is simply decorated with bright cheery smiley face yellow-ish color scheme. They have an easy menu to order from in the back corner of the store.  A 20/40 or better vision is helpful for accomplishing that visual accuity test, or you can just look down at the menu taped down on the counter.  And while I was still talking to a friend about my recent dining experience, the taro milk tea san boba that I ordered was already prepared and waiting for me.  Heck, it was ready before I even recieved my change. Yes, that fast!\n\nThe taro milk tea was good.  And if you are a regular, you might as well get their stamp card, that you can parlay into a free beverage after paying for 10.  You don't even have to be cool like me, or show off your nearly perfected used car purchasing negotiation skills.  Yeah, the folks at Volcano Tea House are equally nice to everyone that pays for their assortment of Asian beverage offerings. A verbal \""thank you\"" or \""xie xie\"" (sounds like shieh shieh) is still appreciated, plus it shows you have some manners. \n\nIs this place good for groups?  Only if the group is not too big or your friends like standing.  There are only a few tables, and not too many chairs, so it is more suited for the order and go crowd.  However, while I was there, I did see a group of Chinese girls playing some card game, and another group of guys chillaxing at another table. \n\nIf this volcano is in the same family tree as the other Volcano Tea Houses in Cali, then this is by far the smallest.  But the drinks, at least the ones I typically order tastes pretty much the same.\n\nParking:  There is almost not enough to share between all the businesses in this tiny strip mall with a handful of really popular dining destinations.  You definitely should carpool, as it is not only good for your wallet, the environment, but for me!\n\nP.S.  Even before I drove out of the parking lot to go write this review, the owner already requested to be my Yelp friend. See the pattern? They really like doing things F-A-S-T!"
0,"why did I come here?  I have been asking myself this question over and over again for the past week.  The girl that did my eyebrows was a mess and completely screwed up my eyebrows then tried to manipulate me into paying twice the price!!\nSo, after she initially did my eyebrows she gave me a mirror to check it out.  I noticed right away that my right eyebrow was arched where as the left eyebrow was rounded.  I told the girl this and she rectified this by rolling the thread on my forehead, i guess to make it seem as if she was actually doing something to fix her mistake.  She then said I was finished and handed me the mirror again.  My eyebrows were obviously still messed up but I didnt feel like being in the presence of this mess of a woman so I just went to pay.\n  She told me that the price was $20.  The price for the eyebrows that were posted all over the studio said $10.  when I gave her a look that said  she must be mistaken she giggled and said, \""oh, I thought you did your lip too.\""  the price for lip threading is $5 which would have made my total $15.  And, we were the only two in the studio at the time and she had just gotten done doing my eyebrows.  I truly don't understand where the misunderstanding came from.  She must be so incompetent to not be able to do math, remember what happened 5 minutes prior AND create symmetry in eyebrows.  DONT COME HERE."
0,"The pizza at this place is bland, dry and almost like a frozen store bought one.  We call it \""cowboy pizza\"".  Terrible sauce, crust and toppings.\n\nThis place seems be dirty and worn out.  Too many boozers that stay too long soaking up the beer and liquor.  Some of them get rude and belligerent.  This place reminds me of \""a beer and a shot joint\"".\n\nThe atmosphere is, sometimes, too loud.  Hard to talk  and be heard.  I wish they would get rid of all that \""cowboy music\""!  I feel that karaoke has run it's course.\n\nThe only item they make decently is \""\n\""Broasted Chicken\"" and it is very expensive for what you get.\n\nI wish someone would open a good quality full service restaurant in Gold Canyon.  We certainly need one.\n\nAdvise is: DON'T GO(unless you're brave enough to put up with loud drunks, bad pizza and filth)"
1,"Met a work acquaintance for lunch here a couple weeks ago. I was leery of the \""lobster mac and cheese\"" having been let down by a similarly titled entree at another local establishment. My reservations were unfounded, as they really came through with a delicious bowl of pasta laced with a variety of rich, wonderful cheeses and a healthy amount of sweet, sweet lobster. Served a tasty Mocha as well on a cool early winter's afternoon.\n\nCan't wait to head back for a deeper dive into the breakfast/brunch faire."
0,This is no longer Francis and Son's car wash. I walked into this place and tried to use my Groupon and the cashier told me it is no longer Francis and Sons anymore. I had to pay full price for my car wash. It would have been helpful for them to post new management signs outside so a customer can know what to expect.
1,This is a really nice salon! Their equipment is top notch. Even their lowest level beds have the high pressure face lamps. I have used the level 2 beds only a few times and already got a great base tan. Plus the bed has a jack for my iPhone so I can listen to my own music if I want. I did try out the upper level Prestige bed the other day. Wow. That bed is AMAZING. It instantly gave me that dark bronze color. The owner is really nice and they do those little extra things like greeting you by name when you walk in the door and offering you a free bottled water when you leave. I'm so glad i decided to check this place out!
0,"I always enjoy my visits to pittsburgh. I was especially excited to visit after finding out there was a great place for breakfast that was on the travel network (man vs. food). I am a true food lover and Food Network and Travel Channel must really love pittsburgh. They are always on man vs food and diners, drive ins and dives. \nI found out the hard way that just because you are showcased on a dandy show doesn't mean your food is up to par. \nJust to make it very clear I am a southerner. I did however go to delucas with my girlfriend who was born and raised in pittsburgh and surrounding suburbs. So I was able to look past the brash attitude of the person at the register yelling at my girlfriend instead of seating us. She however was pretty turned off by it. \nThere wasn't a wait. We got seated pretty quickly after my girlfriend had to let the lady know we were there well before the ambush of people that poured in after we arrived. (that's when my girlfriend got yelled at) \nAfter being seated I was really excited about the food. The place was hoppin and the coffee was really good. The menu had a huge list of things to choose from. I thought it was going to be a great place. I had really high hopes.\nThe server we had was ok. Not very friendly but efficient. She was the shorter of the two I saw. We kind of wished we had the tall girl. She seemed a lot more friendly. \nWe didn't wait too long to get our food but when we got it you would have thought it would have taken a couple hours. I got the biscuits and gravy (one of my favorite breakfast foods) and potatoes. They were both stone cold. The gravy on the biscuits was more like a soup and the potatoes were well cold. I really couldn't get passed the fact that my food was cold. \nMy girlfriend got the california omelette with potatos and fruit with the Italian toast. She like the fruit and toast but that was it. I almost choked on my sausage gravy when I saw her omelette. It was practically black. I know sometimes people over cook eggs. It's not cool but it happens. How do you even send eggs out that are practically black. I guess at least it was hot. Her potatoes needless to say were also cold.\nI was really looking forward to eating at a delicious breakfast place in pittsburgh. I was disappointed."
1,"What can I say that hasn't already been written about Amelie's?  If you appreciate the occasional sweet treat, this place has the best in Charlotte.  I am a fan of macaroons and theirs are simply delish.  The macaroons I have tried here include pistachio, lemon, salted caramel, passion-fruit, and coconut. I particularly enjoyed the coconut and the lemon.  Another favorite treat here is the salted caramel brownie - it has the perfect balance of sweet and just a hint of salt in the creamy caramel. \n\nThere are so many goodies behind the counter that I have not tried yet, and I am always looking forward to my next visit.  The hard part is choosing between the \u00e9clairs, napoleons, tarts, and all of the other yummy-looking pastries!  Thank goodness they aren't close to my work or home, or I'd be having to put in a lot of extra gym time to work off all those extra calories!"
0,"The manager in the restaurant speak nothing to us and then no smile ,  the food is ok ,the restaurant is clean but a very bad service ,I can't understand how can u open a restaurant like that and say nothing to your costumer"
1,"UPDATE - This place is slowly growing on me enough to bump it yet another star thanks to the their Loco Moco.  What you didn't notice they had Loco Moco here too? Neither did I till Mel C. pointed it out.  I really like they use better quality beef for the burger patties and gravy was not to thick.  Even though it's not  made like your typical Loco Moco(rice, burger layered)  I really liked how the burgers are plated on a bed of shredded cabbage instead of rice. The rice was off to the side instead. You can also opt for brown rice as well!  Good for those who are watching our starch intake. Ono grindz! \n\nOh and all the servers at this shift were on the ball! Good job YG&S!"
1,"we went here our last night in Scottsdale and the other reviews are right, this place rocks.  Everything we ordered was perfect and delicious and the service was awesome.  Our waiter even bought us dessert.  Coming from Chicago we had high expectations as we have a ton of good steakhouses here, however this was really a fantastic meal!!  The best part is they are opening in Chicago this summer...woo hoo!!"
1,"I was very pleasantly surprised when I walked in. I guess I wasn't expecting a nice sit down restaurant. It exceeded my expectations in that regard. The server was great. Very attentive. The Palermo pizza was amazing. Buttery great crust, lots of cheese. The Sicilian pizza was very over cooked. The crust was harder and the toppings were chewy and hard. I would get the first pizza again and will be back to try more stuff. Great restaurant."
1,"When I left L.A. and landed in suburban sprawl I thought my days of combing the aisles in the Asian Markets were kaput. Thank heavens I founds Lee Lee's. \n\nThis is a fantastic Asian Market. It's gigantic... bigger than say, a Fry's. Which is very nice because stank fish smell does't permeate the air like it can in some small Asian Markets. \n\nThe selection is great. I think it is very clever and helpful that they have labeled many aisles \""Korean\"", \"" Japanese\"", \""Indian\"" - it certainly makes spice hunting easier. The prices are pretty low for Arizona, but higher than Asian markets in L.A.. For example, 3 or 4 stalks of lemon grass would be $2 and some change, where in L.A. it would be 99 cents. But, hey I can buy fresh lemongrass... score!\n\nThe only gripes I have... \n\n- The herbs come in huge packages. I do not need a pound of Thai basil. However, they have made me smaller packages when I have asked. \n\n- Their rice is expensive considering it is a staple ingredient. It's actually often cheaper to buy brown rice in bulk at Wholepaychecks... ahem.... I mean Foods... which is sayin' something, but whatevs. \n\nLee Lee Market is awesome."
0,"Tried again and it was worse.  I didn't like it.  Ordered a combo plate beef burrito, soft taco and tostada. Took most of it home to try and remake it but it was hopeless. Just not good food."
1,"I had brunch here with a friend a couple weeks ago. It was a great breakfast spot! I had the protein pancakes and some egg whites on the side! Soooo yummy! Our server was friendly and the manager came over and chatted a bit too. Nice place, old school coffee mugs that you almost wish had hot cocoa and marshmallows instead of coffee in 'em! My friend had one of the omelets with potatoes, needless to say she was busy eating rather than participating in the conversation! I'll definitely be back! Good choices for someone trying to stay on a healthier track... as long as you have the strength to choose accordingly! I'll definitely be back!"
0,"I have previously had some mediocre experiences here before, but my wife likes this place, so I decided to give it another try--again to my disappointment.  Upon sitting down at the sushi bar, we placed our drink and appetizer orders right away with our server.  After about ten minutes, I made eye contact with our server chatting away at the greeter stand.  When she came over, I reminded her that I still had not received my Asahi and Sake and with wide eyes she told me it was 'coming right out' as if she had not forgotten, but that apparently opening a bottle of beer takes ten minutes.\n\nAfter I finally got my drinks, we placed our sushi order with the sushi chef.  After another fifteen minutes passed, we received our sushi--an order of two rolls and two orders of nigiri.  The timing of the sushi order was fine, but the chef explained that they had run out of octopus, so he would not be able to make one of my nigiri orders.  We still had not received our appetizers--an order of edamame and an order of pot-stickers.  I again made eye contact with our server (again chatting at the greet stand).  When she came over, I asked about our appetizers--she told us that hot food usually takes longer than the sushi to make.  First of all, we're talking edamame and pot-stickers!  Those should take 5 minutes max.  Secondly, we ordered them as 'appetizers'--you know, those things that come 'before' the meal?  Thirdly, we had now waited 25 minutes for them.  I am a restaurant manager and have 20 years of service industry experience.  I cannot handle when servers begin making excuses for the fact that they forgot our order. Mistakes sometimes happen, excuses should not.\n\nIn addition, my beer and sake glasses were both dirty, my sushi was poorly executed, the nigiri not fresh, and our green tea ice cream was freezerburnt.  If you have not dined here, please spare yourself the experience I payed for today.  Go to Stingray, Pearl, or Blue Wasabi.  Do not waste your money here.  I certainly never will again."
1,"Authentic brick oven pizza! Thin crust ... And delicious !! The atmospheres is like a normal pizzeria with gelato ... For starters we had the bruschetta fresh and amazing !! Then We ordered the traditional Margarita pizza and mushroom pizza .. Both were very good !! Wrapped it up with a lil gelato ,, fig and almond, different but good"
0,Awful! Went in for a gel manicure three days later three nails have polish completely peeled off. Not only that but while there I had to tell the nail tech to do the design I wanted 5 times and she still forgot when I reminded them again someone came in and did the design and it was crooked! I ended up having to go home and clean around my cuticles with all the over spill and I have a hang nail on my pinky now. Worst and I mean WORST! Gel I've ever gotten. I went to this place for convenience and I will make the extra few minute drive to pretty nails in Goodyear.
1,Love this place!!! We always get the chili cheese fries and the hangover burger. Amazing flavor on everything!
0,"Ill start my review by stating that ive been working in the food industry for 7 years now, all fine dining.  I know what works and what doesnt, and what i should expect when eatting at places. With that being said.\n\nMy wife and dined here and i was very disappionted with the over all experiance.  I think the thing that bothered me the most was the wine manager, after saying that we would be hving a 6 course dinner and would not be pairing it with the wine but would be ordering individual glasses of wine and cocktails he just lost all interest in providing an enjoyable experiance.\n After ordering our first drinks and finishing it, a manhattan for myself and champagne for her i was asked if we would like another drink; which i agreed to. instead of bringing out the wine menu again i was made to just state what type of wine i would like, the sommelier brought a glass of cab and just dropped it at the table- no mention of year, make, and region, just a heres a glass of wine, i didnt know if it was a 5 dollar a bottle wine or a 35 dollar a glass wine, nothing. And on top of it all it was corked. \nLuckally they removed it and took it off the bill, they brought out another and the som just dropped it off again, i had to stop him before he walked away and ask what he just gave us, he repllied a cabernet. I litterally had to prompt him with \"" where does it come from, when was it made, who makes it.\""\n\nIf i could grade just the som i would give him a zero, the man has given up on even trying to provide for his clients.\n\nGetting into the food, it was ok not worth what we paid for, the amuse was enjoyable, as well as the duck which was cooked perfectly, but the other 4 courss were average. The smoked sweet potato puree, coupled with the beef and sauce was just way too sweet, totally killed the meat.\n\nI think what put the nail in the coffin while eatting here was the check at the end.  They automatically add 20% gratutity to the bill, it doesnt matter what type of service you get. With the staff already nowing they are getting theirs is it any wonder they could care less.\nFour star 4 diamond yea right."
1,"In great anticipation, we made our way from our hotel to the restaurant.  We were there at 5:45 and had no problems being seated right away. \n\nWe had the #14 nam kao tod meat salad, garlic prawns, tom kha gai soup and crispy duck on drunken noodles.  It was a lot of food, enough for a doggie bag for later too.  \nTo drink, Thai ice tea (creamy almost like an iced coffee) and a Thai Lime drink  (refreshing but too sweet, ask for less sugar). \n\nTotal came to around $75.00 for the two of us.  \n\nNow, I may be crucified for this but, it wasn't knock my socks off amazing.  It was delicious, but I've been spoiled with Thai food here in Toronto.  We go to Express Thai on Dufferin which is owned and operated by a Thai family, and I feel the flavours there are just as fresh and authentic as Lotus of Siam.  We ordered all the things that were rec'd to us, but next time I'll have to be a bit more adventurous with our choices to really experience the magic of this place."
0,"Been wanting to check this place out for quite some time.  First time yesterday, Aug 24, wife and I went there for breakfast.\nI ordered the country fried steak and eggs...most expensive item on menu, $12.49.   New York steak & eggs cheaper.\nNot a good deal.  Flavor was very poor.  Gravy had no flavor at all!!  Very disappointing.  Most  flavorful was the Smuckers jelly.\nOne waiter who was obviously overwhelmed with 5 tables!\nWon't be going back!"
0,"With first impression, this place seemed like a great choice. Good food selections and okay prices. However, make sure you have plenty of time for the chefs and waitresses to delay your day. \n\nWe had a group of 9 and we all ordered fairly simple stuff. I had the deluxe mixed fry combo which was a decent deal. After i finished my meal, 30 minutes~ we are still waiting for 3 entrees to be served. How hard is it to make 2 tonkotsu wiyh rice and a rainbow roll? It ended up late by 1 hour.... Most people would have left or canceled by then but its hard to move a wheelchaired grandparent to another food place. \n\nTheres also other tables that ordered much later than us that are getting their tonkotsu. They didnt forget, because i reminded them every 15 minutes. Its funny because everyone else has finished their meal and im here sitting in the restaurant typing this review. \n\nThe food itself was decent. Everyone was well made but theres nothing to write home about. Free green tea as well. If service wasnt bad, this would be a 3.5 star. \n\nAnother thing to watch out for, the reviews here are highly inflated, you get 10% off for writing a review for them while youre there. \n\nDont come here unless you want to start with lunch and end with dinner."
1,"Booked a room at the Vdara to host my graduation party and boy was I pleased. I can't get enough of this hotel because all the staff were so accommodating to all my needs. In fact, I was so impressed with my stay I emailed the management on how well trained their employees are on providing excellent customer service. If only they trained everyone else in the world working in customer service. I stayed in the executive hospitality suite, which is the largest room they have if I'm not mistaken. 2 bedrooms, living room, kitchen with a large front counter with breakfast nook and 2 and a half baths. There was also a washer and dryer, which is probably useful if you're staying a few days especially if you have kids. The major downer about these rooms is that you don't get a view of the strip or the beautiful fountains at Bellagio because these rooms are located on the opposite side of the hotel. I was told by front desk all these types of suites only have a view of Aria and the I-15 freeway, not bad I'll take it. Beds were comfortable from what I can remember.\n\nThe pool area is small, but ambiance is fitting for the demographic of those staying at the hotel.  Pretty mellow with mainly mid aged adults and a few kids here and there. My only suggestion would be is for the music to be louder as Lee had also mentioned in his review. \n\nP.S. LOCALS: if you are looking to have a \""hotel party\"" Vdara is a good option, despite all the noise coming from my room (music and a ton of people), I did not get one complaint nor did I have security warn me about the noise level. I know at other hotels they shut down your party immediately if other guests are bothered."
1,"I like to hike here as it is not as steep as the Camelback.\n\nMy daughter was five when she first made it to the top. At that time it took her 60 mins one way but she did it in 40 mins today.\n\nThis summit course was my fall back plan whenever I couldn't find a parking at the Camelback while I was training. I seemed to find a parking here and most I had to wait was 5 mins.  1.2 miles one way and about 20-25 mins to get to the top gave me the workout I needed.\n\nThere is no public bathroom near the parking, otherwise, I would hike twice to get the workout I wanted. \n\nOn sunny clear day, the view from the summit is beautiful. I can see as far as the four peaks mountain."
0,"So disappointed ! We read the reviews and headed over, thinking about Lobster Tacos.\n\nParking was a nightmare, poor signage for those of us from out of town. Strolled the grounds looking for the entrance to the resturant, beautiful grounds with all the Christmas lights maned carousel.  The aromas in the air as we entered we so inviting. \n\nThe hostesses were very friendly, but seem surprised we'd be there to dine when we weren't staying there.  Sat us right away, in the corner by the kitchen. The hostess was the only staff we ever spoke with.  Water was poured then we sat and sat and sat and sat.  After 10 minutes (maybe a little more) we hadn't received a \""Hello\"" \""I will be right with you\"" or any kind of greeting so we left.\n\n Perhaps if we'd been a guest at the Fairmont we would have had better service and we would of had the opportunity to experience the Lobster Tacos others rave about."
0,"I had high hopes for this place. It had a very nicely decorated interior and the menu sounded good. However, the food and service did not live up to my expectations. We ordered the pretzels and jalape\u00f1o cheese sauce for an appetizer (my fave thing) and the pretzels came out luke warm and the cheese sauce was so bland. You could not even taste the jalape\u00f1o. Also, our server did not inform us of their happy hour specials, which we would have taken advantage of. My boyfriend ordered the AZ burger which claims to have cheese and a spicy aioli. The beef was so juicy but you could not taste any of the toppings. It literally just tasted like beef. At least it was good quality beef. My Mediterranean salad can be described as \""meh\"". Overall, boring food seriously lacking in flavor. Our server also largely ignored us. We probably won't be back, especially since it was overpriced. A shame."
1,"I LOVE ETHEL'S CHOCOLATES\n\nEverytime I go to Vegas, I have to get Ethel's.  Actually, I got my whole family hooked on this.  So where as before, I would buy myself the custom 12 pack box, I now (at the very minimum) buy the large custom box ($45).  \n\nMy favorites are Peanut Butter and Jelly, Cheesecake, Pina Colada, and Cinnamon Roll."
0,"This place needs some work. Waited 10 minutes for someone, anyone, to pay attention to us at the counter.  No one even acknowledged us.  We left. Won't be back."
0,Worst customer service I've ever encountered in the hospitality industry. Definitely did not feel safe or clean either
0,"These guys are just assholes. \n\nI was forced to throw away Cologne, moisturizer, hair product and a couple other things because I didn't have a plastic bag to put them in. The grooming kit I've traveled with for the last four years (and never had an issue with) apparently isn't good enough for Delta. Even US Airways let me travel with my grooming kit, and they are Satan's airline. Delta: if you do anything worse than US Air, you're hitting an all time low.\n\nThey're also slow through security (wasting people's money takes time) and generally unfriendly. They are really the whole package.\n\nThis shit is why people hate flying. Eff you Delta, never again."
0,"I love Sally because of the cool professional-type items that any Joe Blow off the street can walk in and buy, from professional hair curlers to specialty clips and shampoos. For that I give them 2 stars. \n\nI'd rate this location higher but the RUDE employees here really bother me! I swear they are so condescending and can be downright nasty if you are not a salon professional. I've never had a pleasant experience at this store location; it's the kind of situation where you get the feeling the employees are staring at you and can't wait for you to leave so they can begin making fun of you. In fact, I've heard several workers here do just that to other customers. Very unprofessional and very unwelcoming. I love Sally but don't go to this location. I know I won't go back here any time soon!"
0,"Meh. I was really excited to finally come here but was pretty disappointed.\n\nWhen we were almost there, I had the brilliant idea to look for coupons, as I've heard this place was pretty pricey. But we didn't want to backtrack.\n\nWe got there and it was $30 per person for one race (12 laps around the track). We asked if there was a local's discount and the lady said \""No, but there are some coupons floating around out there...\"" Meanwhile, there's a bunch of receipts next to her with 50% off coupons. Thanks. So we decided to try it out since we were already there. There was a party that filled up the next three races, so we had to wait about 40 minutes. In the meantime, we decided to play their arcade games.\n\nWhat  a JOKE. In order to play them, you insert money in a machine. It costs $1 to even put money on your \""game card.\"" We put in $10. Then we realized that each game cost really weird amounts like $1.27, $1.78. Why you ask? So we put more money on our cards and never really get to use the full amount. In other words, so you waste your money.\n\nThe race was fun, but the track was too narrow. Impossible to pass, or be passed, without bumping into anything. Which is highly prohibited. \n\nTo sum it all up, two words: OVER PRICED.  Will not return, unless it costs me $12, like I saw on all the other receipts. \n\n**TIP** If you check in on Facebook you get a free Monster."
1,"Harvest is an excellent restaurant on the main square in downtown Madison. Their food incorporates local seasonal ingredients. I had a special salad of local heirloom tomatoes with a soft cheese (forgot the name), small leaves of basil and sea salt. Some of the best tomatoes I've had in years. I selected the home-made cavatelli pasta - made with pesto. sliced baby potatoes and green beans. Very good - and finished with a passion fruit sorbet. Highly recommended!"
1,"Loved this date, the food was pretty much what I anticipated as a fondue fan. I was floored however by their extensive dessert menu, where the flaming turtle using dark chocolate was the highlight of the meal. It will be in the potential date night rotation in the future."
0,Thank you for all the emails you sent me on my review! I was surprised at how many responses I recieved from people searching for the right dentist..\nI shared my new dentist information and even got some movie tickets from my dentist for the referrals!\nI find it funny how since I wrote this review how many people have reviewed with 5 stars... They must have a lot of friends and family! \nI hope everyone reads my review and picks the right dentist for your needs!\nHappy Holidays
1,"Yummy!!! The hotdog itself was plump,tasty and grilled just right - add the yummy bulgogi,asian slaw,and yummy sauce were all perfect compliments to the hotdog. The Bf's Angry Dog wasn't just angry - it was pissed off as it was hot to his liking. My daughter's Classic dog with just ketchup seemed boring to me but it was perfect to her. The classic fries would have been better as steak fries with more seasoning....\n\nIt's kinda small inside-they have a big board on one of their walls wiith lots of hand written specials....It was quiet when we walked in but once a group of teens came in the place was crowded and loud. \n\nSadly, Buldogis is just too far away to frequent but if they open up a location in the Silverado Ranch area I would be more than happy to eat lots of their yummy Hotdogs!!!!"
1,Customer service here is good  and i think automatic refill for medication is so convienent since i am forgetfull sometimes.
0,This company does not deliver on what it says.  It takes money and does a little bit then wants more money and now my project (bathroom remodel) has gone on for over 5 months with not one aspect completed.  Stay away from them.
1,"When I think of Coach House, four Cs come to mind:\nCheap, Chill, Charming, and Christmas!\n\nCoach House is a unique little dive bar in Old Town - it's perfect to go for a drink with friends... just know that you're going to a dive bar and you'll be fine!  (Warning - if you go during holiday time, it will likely be packed, hence my mention of Christmas above and the year-round christmas lights in the place!)\n\nCoach House recently celebrated 50 years of business - established in 1959, they are supposedly Scottsdale's Oldest Tavern!  I don't think they've re-modeled ever since... but that adds to the character of the place.  \n\nThere's a parking lot and easy access to cabs because if you're hanging at Coach House for more than just a drink, you'll likely be in need of transportation home."
1,"i think it's a good deal for all you can eat sushi for $27.\n~A  few of my favs:\n\n~No Name Roll: Spicy tuna & asparagus wrapped with a layer of yellowtail\n~Spider Roll: I ask for it with no crab (less fillers, plus it taste better )\nSushi: hamachi, surf clam, raw sweet shrimp ( comes with the shirmp head deep fried! mmmm such goodness!!),snapper. \n\nAll topped off with Green Tea Ice Cream!! =)"
